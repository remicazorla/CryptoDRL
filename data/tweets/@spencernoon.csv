76,2023-02-01 14:51:31+00:00,spencernoon,"Taken together, builders are coming to some interesting conclusions about launching tokens:

- Default mindset of builders is shifting from ""don't even think about a token until our product finds PMF"" to ""we must consider a token from Day 1 to build the best product and find PMF"""
77,2023-02-01 14:51:30+00:00,spencernoon,"5. Best practices for token design will continue to evolve over the years.

This is inevitable — crypto is both a nascent industry and a highly competitive market environment."
78,2023-02-01 14:51:30+00:00,spencernoon,"3. It is impossible to know if a design will work before a token goes live.

4. Arriving at the optimal token design necessitates live experimentation and optimization.

Token economies are complicated. I've seen many thoughtful designs fail to function as intended once launched."
79,2023-02-01 14:51:30+00:00,spencernoon,"2. On average, consumer products with tokens will produce better returns than those without them.

- Devs who play the long game and build gas-efficient apps from Day 1 will have earned the trust of users and therefore be much more likely to win their categories long-term.
- Gas prices will find equilibrium and fall in line with market rates of other L1s."
121,2023-01-27 18:14:26+00:00,spencernoon,"Long Term (pt. 1):
- This is where things get interesting 🍿
- Once the dust settles, app devs will ultimately find themselves in an extremely competitive environment. They will then be forced to build gas-efficient applications if they want to collect any CSR."
122,2023-01-27 18:14:25+00:00,spencernoon,"Medium Term:
- As the system calibrates, at first there will be negative externalities experienced by the broader Canto ecosystem: higher gas costs, more gas-inefficient apps, and lower-grade applications such as forks.
- Users will complain loudly about this on Crypto Twitter 🥹"
123,2023-01-27 18:14:25+00:00,spencernoon,"Short Term:
- CSR incentivizes a turbo-bootstrapping of new apps on Canto, as opportunistic app devs move into this greenfield to make $$

180,2023-01-18 17:44:52+00:00,spencernoon,"h/t my co-founders @jessewldn and @ljin18 for seeding many of these thoughts, as well as the rest of our investment team at @variantfund."
181,2023-01-18 17:43:46+00:00,spencernoon,"9. However, until new and better token models emerge, I suspect most early-stage tokens will consist of #DeFi and infrastructure projects."
182,2023-01-18 17:43:45+00:00,spencernoon,"8. This may change someday. If there are research breakthroughs with token models that help founders bootstrap consumer products without the negative consequences stated above, the pendulum may swing back."
183,2023-01-18 17:43:45+00:00,spencernoon,"7. To that end, I think we will see more web3 consumer products take a page out of @opensea's book and find PMF first without launching a token. They will launch tokens far later in their lifecycles—after they've reached true PMF and are either hyper-scaling or playing defense."
184,2023-01-18 17:43:45+00:00,spencernoon,"6. This especially rings true in web3 consumer, where the bar for success is reaching millions of users. When you need to reach that many people, layering on a token too early is just about the worst thing you can do. We saw this far too often over the last bull market."
185,2023-01-18 17:43:44+00:00,spencernoon,5. It can also make it difficult for founders to know if they've truly found product market fit. Maybe the reason a project's growth is up and to the right is because users are speculating on the token—not because anyone's built a product that is worth using.
186,2023-01-18 17:43:44+00:00,spencernoon,"4. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that timing and sequencing are important too. Launching a token prematurely has negative consequences. It can drag the product experience, making it unusuable and preventing it from finding product market fit."
187,2023-01-18 17:43:44+00:00,spencernoon,"3. Beyond growth, user-owned networks are also more defensible. Products with tokens will have stickier user bases in equilibrium, because those users have a vested interest in seeing through the platform's success. This is what it means to have skin in the game."
188,2023-01-18 17:43:43+00:00,spencernoon,"2. As we've seen with networks like @ethereum and @0xPolygon, ownership creates far better incentive alignment within economies of stakeholders. The end result is that user-owned networks grow bigger and faster than their centralized counterparts."
189,2023-01-18 17:43:43+00:00,spencernoon,1. I have no doubt that the networks that will define the next generation of the internet will turn users into owners via tokens. This is central to our thesis at @variantfund.

646,2022-10-07 16:15:03+00:00,spencernoon,"Pro tips for getting started on CT:

-What's obvious to you is insightful to others
-Be the most authentic version of you
-Assume you're talking to a new audience every day
-Tweet often to collect more data on what works
-Don't worry about bad tweets, the algo doesn't surface 'em"
647,2022-10-07 16:15:02+00:00,spencernoon,"Anecdotally it feels like the number of memes being posted daily to CT is growing exponentially and I don't think that's stopping anytime soon. I personally use @imgflip to make memes in minutes, and I also experiment with new apps like @therememeapp to create memes on the fly."
648,2022-10-07 16:15:02+00:00,spencernoon,"Now, to memes. For better or worse, memes are the language of Crypto Twitter. For an outsider these might seem ridiculous. But once you learn the code, the rewards are immense, both for entertainment and unpacking complex ideas.

You can build a career or a company on the back of great content."
650,2022-10-07 16:15:01+00:00,spencernoon,"Another thing I love about CT is that it can really level the playing field in our biz. When I joined the space in 2013, a key investor discovered my content, reached out, and ended up backing my first startup. I now do this often myself as a VC on the other side of the table."
651,2022-10-07 16:15:00+00:00,spencernoon,"We also use Twitter to learn in public. To do this, we don't just read all of the great content here -- we actively try to engage with it.

652,2022-10-07 16:15:00+00:00,spencernoon,"Of course, @variantfund is all over Twitter. It’s where we introduce the key themes we're investing in.

653,2022-10-07 16:15:00+00:00,spencernoon,"First - how/why did CT become the place where web3's top minds assemble? Because crypto is 24/7/365, and it needs a medium that matches that pace. Twitter as a platform also has exceptionally strong network effects: every user that joins the convo adds value to the conversation."
654,2022-10-07 16:14:59+00:00,spencernoon,"In many ways I owe my career as a web3 founder and investor to Crypto Twitter.

720,2022-09-28 20:58:43+00:00,spencernoon,@patfitzgerald01 It depends on how big the fund is. When Variant started and was smaller we outsourced everything to Carta. Now that we're bigger we've pulled many finance/back office functions in house.
721,2022-09-28 20:55:54+00:00,spencernoon,"@real_philogy The market usually determines a FMV for similar types of early-stage companies. For example, a pre-product company with a world-class team was routinely $40-50M+ post during the bull market. Today in the bear those same companies are getting done at ~30-50% lower valuations."

729,2022-09-28 18:17:32+00:00,spencernoon,@theo__0101 Joining a fund allows you to learn from others (higher rate of learning) and get leverage on your investments in the form of carry (more upside). I personally love being on a team 10x more than being a solo GP.

731,2022-09-28 18:11:58+00:00,spencernoon,"@bawcey Depends on what stage the fund invests in.

- Early-stage: higher risk, higher reward, higher failure rates
- Later-stage: lower risk, lower reward, lower failure rates

If you size your bets correctly, only 1 investment needs to hit for a VC to return an entire fund!"
732,2022-09-28 18:09:53+00:00,spencernoon,"@0x3451 Those are inputs for sure but impt to note that real VCs are LT-focused &amp; picking winners on 5-10 year timeframes. For a seed VC like us, we don't spend many cycles thinking about how global macro affects an investment—if the world is no longer standing we've got bigger problems!"

The VC always pays for dinner unless it's an event hosted by the company!"
734,2022-09-28 17:40:19+00:00,spencernoon,"@burnpile_eth Big difference between a S/T-focused hedge fund who is arbitraging access &amp; masquerading as a VC, and a real VC. Real VCs have 7-10 year lockups and are long-term investors who are agnostic to structure (tokens, NFTs, equity, etc)—it needs to make the most sense for the project."
735,2022-09-28 17:25:08+00:00,spencernoon,"@binji_x Yes there are caps. This is bc most VC vehicles can only have a maximum of 100-200 LPs by law, so they typically institute artificial minimums to get to their target amount as well as caps to prevent platform risk. You don't want one LP who pulls out to ruin your next fund."
736,2022-09-28 17:00:45+00:00,spencernoon,"@0xfoobar ...this has forced us to be more diligent &amp; thesis-driven up-front, so that we have fewer surprises as new narratives/themes emerge. For seed VCs, team is the #1 dimension you're underwriting. Teams *must* be able to navigate the environment skillfully since it's always changing."
737,2022-09-28 16:58:12+00:00,spencernoon,"@0xfoobar You just nailed an important dynamic. Many funds invest in adjacent/competitive projects to their portcos, which the market seems to have accepted for now but is not exactly a popular strategy with founders. We try to avoid this as much as possible at Variant, so in practice..."

On the flip side bear markets are historically great times for infra, and that is definitely the case right now with L1s, L2s, zkEVM deals etc."
741,2022-09-28 14:18:54+00:00,spencernoon,"@0xZachamm Good Q! We frequently collab with other VCs b/c our fund size allows us to, but there is an element of friendly competitiveness too so we don't usually share reports. When we lead a deal we work with the teams to fill out the round w top strategic angels/funds that can add value."
742,2022-09-28 14:09:21+00:00,spencernoon,"@codygarrison_ Nice! I'd love to see this contemplate stage. For example, some firms are great for Series A and later stage investments, but not as much in seed, where dedicated seed funds like Variant specialize."
743,2022-09-28 14:06:58+00:00,spencernoon,"@ItsTayyab Great question! Defensibility (i.e. moats) is one of the key dimensions we try to evaluate.

2209,2022-01-24 15:18:32+00:00,spencernoon,"🔹Belief bias

An effect where someone's evaluation of the logical strength of an argument is biased by the believability of the conclusion.

Be sure to evaluate the underlying assumptions of persuasive tweets, even if it has hundreds of likes and retweets."
2210,2022-01-24 15:18:31+00:00,spencernoon,"🔹Unit bias

The tendency to buy a whole unit of something instead of a fractional one, despite worse fundamentals.

Watch out for influencers who shill you ""cheap coins"" that actually have poor fundamentals. Usually used in conjunction with relative value trade ideas."
2211,2022-01-24 15:18:30+00:00,spencernoon,"🔹Endowment effect

The tendency for people to demand much more to give up an object than they would be willing to pay to acquire it.

HODLing has been a great strategy in the past but be wary of those who say it's the only option. Crypto is liquid. You can sell and buy back."
2212,2022-01-24 15:18:29+00:00,spencernoon,"🔹Anchoring bias

The tendency to rely too heavily—to ""anchor""—on one trait or piece of information when making decisions (usually the first piece of info acquired on that subject).

Be wary of fortune cookie accounts who refuse to update their views in light of new information."
2213,2022-01-24 15:18:28+00:00,spencernoon,"🔹Sunk cost fallacy

People demonstrate ""a greater tendency to continue an endeavor once an investment in money, effort, or time has been made."" 

During bear markets this often manifests in a refusal to cut one's losses."
2214,2022-01-24 15:18:27+00:00,spencernoon,"🔹Semantic dispute

When two people disagree on the definition of a word or phrase, not because they disagree on material facts, but rather because they disagree on the definitions of a word(s) essential to formulating the argument.

See: almost every debate on crypto twitter."
2215,2022-01-24 15:18:27+00:00,spencernoon,"🔹Straw man fallacy

When someone gives the impression of refuting an argument, but the real subject of the argument was not addressed or refuted, but instead replaced with a false one. 

Often used by influencers arguing ""their coin"" is better than another."
2216,2022-01-24 15:18:26+00:00,spencernoon,"🔹The Dunning–Kruger effect

The cognitive bias whereby people with low ability at a task overestimate their ability.

Understand the difference between someone who has a track record of success someone who was just lucky."
2217,2022-01-24 15:18:25+00:00,spencernoon,"🔹Hindsight bias

Sometimes called the ""I-knew-it-all-along"" effect, the tendency to see past events as being predictable before they happened.

The truth is it's nearly impossible to call the top or bottom. Don't beat yourself up."
2218,2022-01-24 15:18:23+00:00,spencernoon,"🔹Cunningham's Law 

States ""the best way to get the right answer on the internet is not to ask a question; it's to post the wrong answer.""

Tread carefully, today this is one of the most popular tactics used by top accounts."

2682,2021-10-19 14:47:04+00:00,spencernoon,"9/The ownership economy is not just something that we invest against, but a thesis that we live and breathe ourselves. The Variant Community represents our users (the founders we back + builders in the community) having ownership in the fund."

2689,2021-10-19 14:47:01+00:00,spencernoon,"2/At Variant, we believe crypto is more than a technological breakthrough, but a societal revolution predicated on ownership, the most powerful incentive in capitalism.

These high-level targets make sense and prove that $AGLD can still be valuable regardless of its governance authority. No one needs to panic. https://t.co/sQ4tY2inMZ"
3022,2021-09-08 03:37:35+00:00,spencernoon,"7/But even if $AGLD doesn’t end up with governance rights, my hope is that it is accepted as a legitimate asset with utility. Perhaps as an in-game currency. 

Why? 

Because a LootDAO ERC20 with a dynamic monetary base is a great treasury asset for funding ecosystem initiatives."

(i) Put unclaimed Loot in a treasury and fractionalize it, letting those fractions vote on how the treasury will vote in governance.

(ii) Use mLoot instead"

A two-tier structure allows the community to deploy the $AGLD treasury (+expand supply responsibly if needed) w/o destroying the value of og #Loot. A win-win.

DeFi as a search term is too noisy but surely the subset of DeFi that is crypto-related is much larger and growing much faster than the RPRA 

Using ""DeFi crypto"" allows us to isolate crypto and provide a *proxy* for the general term https://t.co/PRAaqS6vBQ"

Putting it all together: Tezos clearly understands that making your governance robust and credible is really hard, but if you can do it, you can unlock true community-driven innovation. This is important for $XTZ developing a sustainable monetary premium long-term."
6780,2019-12-20 18:00:19+00:00,spencernoon,"5/6. Like everything that happens on Tezos, community input is prioritized. I expect LabNet to evolve based on feedback submitted on the forum and also questionnaires like this one:

6782,2019-12-20 18:00:17+00:00,spencernoon,"3/6. This is smart and practical. All projects have testnets, and Tezos already has 3, but a purely experimental one lets you incorporate cutting-edge features, and maybe copy big features from other top projects...

All without sacrificing mainnet stability or network effects."
6783,2019-12-20 18:00:17+00:00,spencernoon,"2/6. LabNet is a brand new testnet for Tezos that is designed to accomplish the following:

🧪 Experimentation
🌀 Rapid iteration
💭 User feedback

The idea is to give devs a safe space to experiment, plus give the community a safe space to discuss and give feedback."
6784,2019-12-20 18:00:17+00:00,spencernoon,"1/6. Many projects talk about on-chain governance like they've already solved it, but they really only have a simple coin vote 🤦🏻‍♂️.

6793,2019-12-19 20:41:04+00:00,spencernoon,"@NickSandomeno I’m optimistic but it’s early so I’m not sure we can be confident about anything. It will likely come down to validator composition (missionary, mercenary, L/T-focused investors, etc.) and fundamentals of the staking asset (i.e. utility, value capture, growth prospects, etc.)."
6794,2019-12-19 18:55:04+00:00,spencernoon,"@LongLastToken No, that’s a bad assumption. There is no single well-designed PoS network that will have 100% staking participation in a mature equilibrium state."
6795,2019-12-19 18:34:23+00:00,spencernoon,@duganist Early networks don’t have enough economic activity to incentivize stakers purely through fees. Inflation is a bootstrapping mechanism that can be deprecated if it’s no longer necessary.
6796,2019-12-19 18:06:11+00:00,spencernoon,"If you don’t believe in a crypto economic system or think it’s charging too much of a tax on holders, opt out of it. And if enough people don’t believe in it, the beauty is that you can actually use governance (even forking) to change it."
6797,2019-12-19 18:03:10+00:00,spencernoon,Inflation in Proof of Stake is not some slimey way to transfer wealth from the poor to the rich; it is quite literally how non-stakers pay stakers to secure their network. Stakers are performing actual work with skin in the game. This is called being compensated appropriately.

6860,2019-12-10 20:10:47+00:00,spencernoon,"11/11. As a result of these shenanigans, I believe we'll see fewer party rounds in the future and more rounds with fewer &amp; more trustworthy investors. Token supplies might not be as decentralized as we'd all like, but it will be a good thing overall.

RIP Party Rounds ☠️"
6861,2019-12-10 20:10:46+00:00,spencernoon,10/11. This is all coming to a head behind the scenes. Teams are realizing they let too many ppl onto their cap/token tables over the past few years. They partnered with investors who masqueraded as VCs but were really just hedge funds that dump tokens when the going gets tough.
6862,2019-12-10 20:10:46+00:00,spencernoon,"9/11. But it gets even worse: team tokens are now in the hands of unknown parties. This introduces major KYC/AML, legal and regulatory concerns to projects. And teams don't even know it yet as these sales happened without their knowledge behind closed doors!"
6863,2019-12-10 20:10:45+00:00,spencernoon,"8/11. As you can imagine, OTC sales are devastating to early-stage projects, many of whom are still trying to find their feet. As if they didn't already have enough to deal with, now they have problems related to token supply/demand dynamics as well as investor optics."
6864,2019-12-10 20:10:45+00:00,spencernoon,7/11. Generally token offers like this mean 1 of 2 things: either (1) someone from the team is selling or (2) an early investor is selling. I've investigated a few of these deals myself and while some have been team sales (not a good sign) - most sales are because of (2).

Or applications that need throughput. This is the big opportunity for other SC platforms!"

1. Modular Infrastructure - Strong Defensibility
2. Composability - Weak
3. Performance - Weak
4. Token Standards - Strong

Overall, a very strong moat."
8907,2019-01-17 23:55:34+00:00,spencernoon,"🕞 Finally—there is a huge incentive for projects to stick with Ethereum's token standards because (1) tokens are a prominent, modular building block for applications and (2) they offer ease of integration with 3rd parties (e.g. 3rd-party exchanges)."
8908,2019-01-17 23:55:34+00:00,spencernoon,🕒 Composability is offered by other blockchains today but it is useless unless there is modular infrastructure to go along with it. Minimal performance requirements for apps means that #OpenFinance developers aren't necessarily looking for other platforms to support their needs.
8909,2019-01-17 23:55:33+00:00,spencernoon,"🕝 How defensible are all of these? The network effects of modular infrastructure are quite clear, and Ethereum's lead in developer mindshare means more pieces of infrastructure are coming to market faster than any other platform. In other words, the lead is growing by the day."
8910,2019-01-17 23:55:33+00:00,spencernoon,"🕑 Token standards. With ERC-20, ERC-721, and others already ubiquitous, Ethereum is currently the leading platform for tokenized assets (specifically crypto-native ones). Most #OpenFinance applications leverage assets in some way—another modular building block for developers."
8911,2019-01-17 23:55:32+00:00,spencernoon,"🕜 Minimal performance requirements. Many Open Finance applications simply don't need blockchains that support many transactions per second. For example, you can open/close a @MakerDAO CDP worth millions of $ in only a few transactions, over a customer lifecycle that takes years!"
8912,2019-01-17 23:55:31+00:00,spencernoon,"🕐 $ETH also has composability which is best illustrated by an example. Imagine an app needs to call @AugurProject, @0xProject &amp; @compoundfinance sequentially. ETH 1.0 guarantees this in a way that next-gen platforms may not—and the results are powerful.
