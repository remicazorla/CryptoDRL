1,2023-02-26 22:00:18+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@benedictevans @SahilBloom Its the shift to the ""no algo"" option by users (at Elons behest) that is the issue and that collapsed engagement by some 70% vs when people mostly used the algo. I survey people about this a couple of weeks ago. Big behaviour change that killed engagement in my view"
2,2023-02-26 21:53:11+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@SahilBloom @benedictevans It's the shift that 76% of people now use ""Following"" so only see tweets that are active over the period they log in. Algo's are there to amp engagement and chronological feeds tend to do the opposite."

Those that are concerned by the rapid societal change begin to bet on narratives of nostalgia (h/t @DeeSmithTexas), the times of the past that give us comfort - fossil fuels, value stocks, anti-financialization, austerity, etc"
591,2023-01-16 00:00:41+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Futures and options were invented both for speculation and for insurance, creating a deep 2-sided market.

In this case, they become the same thing. Finance becomes like voting based on memes, narratives and myths.

All day on FinTwit and CT this plays out and in markets too."
592,2023-01-16 00:00:40+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Some communities reject the future, some embrace the uncertainty and others see different futures. In this day and age of financialization, we get to speculative on these outcomes and create ""Speculative Communities"".

1012,2022-11-16 13:34:37+00:00,RaoulGMI,@Jathgas Im trying to figure that out but it is much less L1 intensive so is mainly marginal for now on its impacts.
1013,2022-11-16 13:33:47+00:00,RaoulGMI,Looks like it's pretty much the end of the CeFI business model of laying off crypto lending risks onto retail investors. It will have to be DeFi and also wholesale lending markets with bigger traditional balance sheets and regulated better trad risk management going forwards.

1017,2022-11-16 12:42:42+00:00,RaoulGMI,@lighthousejerry Correct. Market does a great job pricing the network.
1018,2022-11-16 12:37:54+00:00,RaoulGMI,"This + ETH burn is why ETH tends to outperform over time.

Hope that helps."
1019,2022-11-16 12:37:53+00:00,RaoulGMI,The difference in the Metcalfes Law output in ETH vs BTC also exactly maps the ETH/BTC ratio. BTC is thus a more valuable network but an increase in # of users or value per transaction works through the multiplier as the volume of transactions is so high.
1020,2022-11-16 12:37:52+00:00,RaoulGMI,But that is offset by extremely robust volume of transactions (NFT's and other network use cases). ETH maybe do smaller average transaction sizes than BTC but it does 5x as many. https://t.co/6orIbjQ9Ff
1021,2022-11-16 12:37:51+00:00,RaoulGMI,But value of transactions have fallen (mainly driven by lower NFT values) https://t.co/5Qkas91P89
1022,2022-11-16 12:37:50+00:00,RaoulGMI,"The number of users is very steady, barring a couple of peaks... adoption in ETH remains robust. https://t.co/Hp34mFYGuL"
1023,2022-11-16 12:37:48+00:00,RaoulGMI,Several of you asked for my Metcalfe's Law mode for ETH. ETH trades at a premium to its raw network value. I need to adjust for burning which makes up the difference but haven't yet done the work... 1/ https://t.co/ipJuTibjBu
1024,2022-11-16 11:54:50+00:00,RaoulGMI,"In bear markets, the value transacted goes down but number of active users remains more elevated (ongoing adoption).

When adoption rises (users) x value rises (uses), prices go exponential due to the mathematical multiplier."
1025,2022-11-16 11:54:50+00:00,RaoulGMI,"When liquidity returns (the biggest driver of institutional allocations), the value of the network should rise, which then brings in more investors (or vice versa - # of investors rising will bring in more insto's) which creates a multiplier effect, giving exponential returns."
1026,2022-11-16 11:54:49+00:00,RaoulGMI,"The total value transacted is down as bigger institutional players remain on the sidelines but on average it has remained around peak 2018 levels. 2018 was a retail boom but 2020 onwards was retail plus institutions, suggesting deeper adoption. https://t.co/6ZNwBPAEgl"
1027,2022-11-16 11:54:48+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Note how big the number of active users was in 2018 and the number who left in 2019. 

This bear market is very different as users have remained broadly stable as deeper adoption takes hold vs pure speculation."
1028,2022-11-16 11:54:47+00:00,RaoulGMI,"It also prices the network correctly in value versus 2018. 

For the network value to rise from here, we need to see the total value transacted increase or the number of active users increase. 

The number of active users is pretty flat on average (Chart from @MessariCrypto ) https://t.co/YvxO7uGUV5"
1029,2022-11-16 11:54:46+00:00,RaoulGMI,Network activity peaked in 2020 and again in 2021 and has been drifting lower. The slow trajectory in decline in network activity is why this liquidity cycle correction in magnitude has so far been less than previous examples thus far.
1030,2022-11-16 11:54:46+00:00,RaoulGMI,Just an update to my Metcalfe's Law model for BTC. The model is the total $ value exchanged monthly x number of active users and has a correlation of 97% to total market cap.   1/ https://t.co/EJqY5I3GRE

Don't use leverage.

1051,2022-11-14 13:24:52+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Here we are again...somewhere near the bottom of the cycle (ETH probably bottomed in June) and the lows of despair are pervasive as everyone loses their minds, just as they did at the bottom phase of each previous cycle...

1056,2022-11-14 13:24:44+00:00,RaoulGMI,"The boom/bust phase is driven by global money supply. When money is tight, people go bust. Also there is less money for speculation. 

This is when the tide goes out and you can see who is swimming naked... https://t.co/LMVz0KEKVY"
1057,2022-11-14 13:24:43+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Also, retail  shouldn't use naked leverage as large price swings are frequent and you lose your capital, fast. Options are much better as you only have defined risk, like my wrong ETH bet in 2021. It could only ever cost me 5% of my bag. The risk I did run was counterparty risk."
1058,2022-11-14 13:24:43+00:00,RaoulGMI,This brings me on to leverage. When I refer to leverage I am mainly referring to business models that require leverage. It is almost impossible to manage open-ended leveraged balance sheets when the collateral falls 80% or your cashflows fall 50% over the cycle.
1059,2022-11-14 13:24:42+00:00,RaoulGMI,"This time it's the CeFi and FTX collapse and here we are again in the Scam! Ponzi! phase. At all these phases, people tend to leave the space (and come back in the next bull run). https://t.co/4EEEM7aeel"

Try not to get too stressed. Make sure your risk tolerance matches your time horizon and have a plan and invest accordingly. Dont use leverage.

1090,2022-11-09 15:09:15+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Meanwhile, I focus on the macro and what liquidity conditions will be in 6months and 12 months and it will be a 180 degrees different than now. 

It won't be 2020 (a super liquidity cycle) but it will see liquidity growth again to counteract economic weakness."
1091,2022-11-09 15:09:14+00:00,RaoulGMI,"I also think NFT's are getting more and more interesting.

1438,2022-10-11 01:42:01+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@GreekFire23 I tend to use a business cycle framework as it has been very good over last 100 years using ISM. Bonds currently price ISM at 74, most divergence in history of bond markets. This is why is think bonds are broken"
1439,2022-10-11 01:38:37+00:00,RaoulGMI,@GreekFire23 Hmm… not sure I understand but I think Fed have gone too far and Brainard today started to acknowledge that
1440,2022-10-11 01:36:32+00:00,RaoulGMI,@GreekFire23 Probably 75bps until Fed gives up the Volcker nonsense and realises it will be 1929 unless they change stance
1441,2022-10-11 01:34:28+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@GreekFire23 Yes, probably inverts more too"
1442,2022-10-11 01:33:45+00:00,RaoulGMI,@soclose2me Not really. Real Vision grows at more than 50% a year with 65%+ margins. Rates make fuck all difference really
1443,2022-10-11 01:32:29+00:00,RaoulGMI,@GreekFire23 Not really as Fed hikes are a function of growth expectations plus inflation and they are always behind the bond market
1444,2022-10-11 01:31:35+00:00,RaoulGMI,Lots of interesting replies that India is different because of costs or demographics but truth is margins are similar globally and tech growth rates are same globally. Lots of inconsistencies here…
1445,2022-10-11 01:28:21+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@GreekFire23 Because break evens keep falling, as does growth. Bonds are inflation expectations + growth expectations"
1446,2022-10-11 01:26:35+00:00,RaoulGMI,@Kev19081874 It’s all about margins. Indian firms don’t have bigger margins
1447,2022-10-11 01:24:38+00:00,RaoulGMI,@arie_scherson Indeed
1448,2022-10-11 01:23:23+00:00,RaoulGMI,@soclose2me Yes but discounting companies growing at 50%+ with 4% is noise
1449,2022-10-11 01:15:44+00:00,RaoulGMI,@soclose2me Remember IBM and Xerox in the 70’s and 80’s. I think rates are a red herring and I think rates go lower anyway
1450,2022-10-11 01:12:21+00:00,RaoulGMI,There is a puzzle in trying to figure out. Many people say that growth tech can’t grow without low rates but I look across at India with 7.5% rates and growth tech is growing like crazy and with high valuations. 4% US rates is hardly a hurdle for a fast growing sector…

I do remember clearly an angry call suggesting a more accurate model for 70,000 deaths and my being a irresponsible idiot. A sad memory."

1466,2022-10-10 00:32:02+00:00,RaoulGMI,@freedomOrfamily My place is near Point of Sand
1467,2022-10-09 23:54:25+00:00,RaoulGMI,"The Fed and the treasury like a strong dollar as it imports deflation but other countries are struggling and the IMF/WB meetings this week will cement the view that the Fed needs to slow this.

Let's see how it plays out. Time to  focus hard in the next 1 to 3 weeks..."
1468,2022-10-09 23:54:24+00:00,RaoulGMI,"If anything is going to accelerate the current narrative, its CPI and the bond market reaction. 

If bonds break foreign bond markets, expect the Fed to take notice. It is very very precarious as liquidity in bonds is SUPER low.

And the dollar... well, it's just a wrecking ball"
1469,2022-10-09 23:54:24+00:00,RaoulGMI,"You are probably reading this thinking, no, its all going way lower (Earnings Recession! Depression! Nuclear war!). 

You might be right but I got the low in 2020 with same set of tools (closed out all positions back then). I think the odds are good based on the macro indicators."
1470,2022-10-09 23:54:23+00:00,RaoulGMI,"The daily DeMarks suggest possible further downside first. 

Maybe it's a flush out couple of weeks? Dunno. It's not clear. But full caution/focus is required.

But the technicals are suggesting that a meaningful low is coming in October. 

Sentiment is RECORD bearish too. .."
1471,2022-10-09 23:54:23+00:00,RaoulGMI,And NDX too...But could take a few weeks for the low to form as we count to 13 too https://t.co/J9qbxZw8DE

1482,2022-10-09 16:50:20+00:00,RaoulGMI,"I find @biancoresearch 's thoughts super interesting. He has high conviction in his extremely well thought out views. I don't share some of them but I take them extremely seriously. I'm more dovish than Jim is overall 

Quality differing opinions are vital in this complex world.."
1483,2022-10-09 16:39:47+00:00,RaoulGMI,@soclose2me Not centralised but decentralised with different tokens that are interoperable and use zero knowledge proofs.
1484,2022-10-09 15:05:27+00:00,RaoulGMI,"It is also probably the biggest application of blockchain that exists today. 

I don't think it can be solved by a start up, the path to scale is too full of friction.

Like it or not, the mega platform need to solve this. It is of utmost importance."
1485,2022-10-09 15:05:26+00:00,RaoulGMI,"We all desperately need an ID privacy token, as does verified AI (AI will be a VERY big part of our on line experience very, very soon) or we will see online society dissolve even more than it has already. it is URGENT."
1486,2022-10-09 15:05:26+00:00,RaoulGMI,"India did this very well with Aadhar and India Stack for KYC/ID but its not decentralised yet. 

It makes any KYC interaction pretty fast but it needs to go further to digital online ID with privacy. 

They need a token system."
1487,2022-10-09 15:05:26+00:00,RaoulGMI,"The good thing is that ALL the incumbents are thinking this through and understand the different ownership of data under Web 3. The narrative is that Google/Meta etc don't get it, but they do. 

Good people in these firms are working hard on this, fighting the fight..."
1488,2022-10-09 15:05:25+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Why the Web 2 incumbents? 

Because they all need to accept each others ID tokens and they have 5bn users. Only they can get the banking system etc to work with them. The banks can be partners as can payments co's like PayPal and crypto exchanges and brokers (all do KYC now)"
1489,2022-10-09 15:05:25+00:00,RaoulGMI,"I do think that this is something that has to be done by Google, Apple, Twitter, Meta, TikTok, LinkedIn for speed and scale of adoption.

But they CANT have access to the underlying data but will be free to build social graphs on chain, must like Google Analytic does for the Web."
1490,2022-10-09 15:05:24+00:00,RaoulGMI,"To protect privacy we need zero knowledge proofs for authentication where possible, and we absolutely MUST HAVE interoperability of the authentication/ID tokens across platforms. 

Some of the complexity is who will act are verification agents? or how else to solve it?"
1491,2022-10-09 15:05:24+00:00,RaoulGMI,"For society to even function, we will need to know who is real and who isn't, what is a true source of information, what is original, what AI is ""authenticated/verified"". 

There is nothing wrong with AI but it too needs a digital identity.

Clearly, blockchain solves this but"

1887,2022-09-06 01:26:52+00:00,RaoulGMI,@ShardiB2 This was one of the best trades of the last 3 years...as per my thread.
1888,2022-09-06 01:16:42+00:00,RaoulGMI,"In other markets, it is often just flows (such as 401k passive flows in US ) or pension finds in EU bonds. But these need to be secular to matter or its a cyclical trade which produces good returns in the cycle but terrible returns in longer term time horizons (commodities)."
1889,2022-09-06 01:16:42+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Hope that helps a bit. 

Longer-term risk taking (or any risk taking) is not an easy game! People make it sound like its a science, but it's a art over longer time horizons.

In crypto and tech, network adoption is the KEY driver to add into this mix too."
1890,2022-09-06 01:16:41+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Many things will have done better, most worst.

But if you choose an aggressive asset allocation in a particular asset, please make sure you are getting rewarded for it and make sure its trending too (or its just fleeting returns)."
1891,2022-09-06 01:16:41+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Also, over time, as assets get more mature, their risk/reward goes down as risk is less.

Summing it up, using the brand range of risks, ETH has been the best single major asset to own and SENSEX probably second but that comes with caveats...."
1892,2022-09-06 01:16:40+00:00,RaoulGMI,"If you are reward seeking, not on a risk/adjusted basis, then we get this:

NDX 108%
SENSEX 128%
ETH/BTC 403%
BTC 521%
ETH 1850%

Hmmm....

But you need to see risk too... so maybe current return since 2019 vs max drawdown?"
1893,2022-09-06 01:16:40+00:00,RaoulGMI,"But the ETH/BTC cross rate has an even better Sharpe of 1.8%. 

That has been one hell of a trade. But, Sharpe ratio's don't remain stable either so its always backwards looking and depends on time horizon.

However...

Risk/Adjusted returns aren't everything either..."
1894,2022-09-06 01:16:39+00:00,RaoulGMI,"However in India, around 6% of the returns is explained by interest rates, which lowers the Sharpe a tad but still very good...

In crypto markets: 

BTC since 2019 has a Sharpe of 1.24, sort of ok.
ETH has a Sharpe of 1.62, pretty damned good."
1895,2022-09-06 01:16:39+00:00,RaoulGMI,"The Sensex in India, low debt, young demographics and accelerated tech adoption is the opposite and the risk is highly compensated. The annual return since 2019 is 40% and the volatility is on average 15%. A stunning approx Sharpe ratio of 2.66!"
1896,2022-09-06 01:16:38+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Since the 2019 low, the Sharpe ratio of the Nasdaq is around 1. 

The NDX is volatile but you get the turns to compensate for it. That is pretty normal for developed economy equity markets. Returns roughly equal the risk taken.

You need to look for secular trends to do better..."
1897,2022-09-06 01:16:38+00:00,RaoulGMI,"If an asset has 30% annual returns and 30% average 30 day volatility, the Sharpe ratio is very roughly 1. If the returns are less than the vol, its &lt;1 and above its &gt;1. 

It is a useful guide to finding if you have the right asset for your allocation."
1898,2022-09-06 01:16:38+00:00,RaoulGMI,"In simple terms, Sharpe &lt;1 not great, Sharpe &lt;0.50 a crap shoot, Sharpe &gt; 1 a good risk reward.

For many reasons, its not a perfect guide but it helps understand if the risk you are taking over time is worth it..."
1899,2022-09-06 01:16:37+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Understanding risk...

A Sharpe Ratio is (roughly speaking) the excess returns over the observable volatility of an asset. A Sharpe over 1 suggests you get more than compensated for the volatility of an asset. Its important... 1/"

Massive, ongoing direct transfer payments are v different to QE and can create instant inflation... but yes, in the end, if you debase a currency enough, you can create hyperinflation but its actually hard."

2392,2022-07-21 22:02:18+00:00,RaoulGMI,Note that global M2 growth is turning. Early days but crypto is forward looking in nature and turns earlier than most assets as its such long duration.

I have always erred on the side of demand being more important than supply in market prices of all goods.

It is the demand ebb that causes the outflow and the denominator."

Have a community entry pass NFT. 

Sub-divide the community with NFT's to allow like minded people to collaborate and then once there is utility, you can have a utility/social/community token for broader network effects."

Short term price targets are trading, I am an investor. I dont sell, just add (but do shift token allocations)"
2549,2022-07-11 01:47:44+00:00,RaoulGMI,@BtcCuracao @TuurDemeester Excellent. I hope it gets network effects and conquers.
2550,2022-07-11 01:44:00+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@RonnieMoas @tanyp1960 Fine, you do you and I'll do what I think and you can discount it as can others."
2551,2022-07-11 01:42:57+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@_log_scale_ @TuurDemeester @thetractatus No, I just understand the risks I want to run. If they dont work, that is fine too."
2552,2022-07-11 01:42:01+00:00,RaoulGMI,@TuurDemeester Makes sense if those are your requirements. Would definitely give it more certainty.
2553,2022-07-11 01:41:11+00:00,RaoulGMI,@RonnieMoas @t_social_2021 @tanyp1960 I have always been clear about volatility and drawdowns.
2554,2022-07-11 01:30:35+00:00,RaoulGMI,@StephenW_io @SBF I guess so. Its riskier for sure. hence the discount is required.
2555,2022-07-11 01:27:07+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@TuurDemeester Again, this is your choice. You might have said that about Amazon too. Neither you nor I know. We forecast our own probabilities and bet accordingly. Accept that, and life is much easier. It is not a zero sum game nonsense."
2556,2022-07-11 01:25:54+00:00,RaoulGMI,@RonnieMoas @tanyp1960 Or maybe we got it wrong and truly believed it wa sa decent probability and maybe it was? Even if it had a 70% probability it has a 30% chance of being wrong! This is just how the markets work. there are no certainties...ever... in anything. There are only probabilities.
2557,2022-07-11 01:24:24+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@NStrumingher @TuurDemeester Yes, they accept probabilistic risk vs near certainty. Life is all about trade offs depending on the use case. BTC's use case cant accept trades floss and that is good."
2558,2022-07-11 01:22:01+00:00,RaoulGMI,@Arrow_Apollo @TuurDemeester Good for them. Some people believe inflation is going to be the 1970's and I believe it goes negative. I can hold both thoughts in my head and assess the probabilities without worrying but others views
2559,2022-07-11 01:18:37+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@TuurDemeester Again, that is your opinion which is fine but the network effects of ETH cannot be denied so you just have to prefer BTC as your personal choice but understand that it does not solve the problems ETH and others do, and that is absolutely fine. Different things."
2560,2022-07-11 01:10:07+00:00,RaoulGMI,@Arrow_Apollo @TuurDemeester He can have his opinions too. You can also discount them.
2561,2022-07-11 01:05:15+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@TuurDemeester You need to think that it is both possibly an amazing breakthrough and that it also has risk. Then assess the probability yourself. I dont think anyone thinks it has more security than BTC, just more than ETH now. POW and BTC is perfect for BTC and BTC is perfect in its role"
2562,2022-07-11 00:51:54+00:00,RaoulGMI,@FalkorLucky @CathieDWood @SantiagoAuFund @DaveHcontrarian I think you need to develop your own framework.

2567,2022-07-10 19:21:17+00:00,RaoulGMI,@jradway1 @RealVision Thanks for beta testing it! We are really excited about it but really want to get it right so make sure you give your feedback!
2568,2022-07-10 15:33:50+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@pirate_teddy Sure, and that is in the forward model that ISM falls to 35.... that is a nasty recession that monetary conditions have already set. The Fed is a sideshow as the market has already priced this."
2569,2022-07-10 15:20:47+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Just to be clear - I think risk assets probably go lower before reversing but not 100% sure. Yes, there is a risk of an extended recession like 2001/2 or 2008/9 but I dont really see that being the higher odds. Im still using 1947, 1974 and 2018 as my blended hypothesis"
2570,2022-07-10 15:15:50+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@lark_quark Yes, the macro complexity right now is enormous."
2571,2022-07-10 15:07:29+00:00,RaoulGMI,"The next 2 to 3 months will reveal a lot. As Stan Druckmiller says, the job of a macro investor is to buy or sell assets that are the most mispriced for the 12 to 18 months out. In the next 12 to 18 months we will have had a recession. Monetary conditions will be much weaker."
2572,2022-07-10 15:07:29+00:00,RaoulGMI,"And that is roughly the inverse of ISM (ISM leads by 9 months). As ISM falls M2 should begin to grow.... ISM of 38, as per the model, puts M2 growth back at 13%. https://t.co/m381yRYNAY"
2573,2022-07-10 15:07:28+00:00,RaoulGMI,"So, I like growth tech but love bonds but clearly there are always risks to this view. This is how I see the balance of probabilities. What about digital assets?

From a macro perspective, the big driver is global M2 growth. https://t.co/K8nXkGx0nk"
2574,2022-07-10 15:07:26+00:00,RaoulGMI,"As Soros writes in his trading notes in the Alchemy of Finance, the best time to buy bonds is when the yield curve is inverted as the future expected returns are very high... https://t.co/Rq78u9JNL2"
2575,2022-07-10 15:07:25+00:00,RaoulGMI,And bonds are diverging which it a repeat of 2000. Yields and oil collapsed eventually. We also saw a similar mismatch in 1994 and yields fell. https://t.co/wHTePPdWPI
2576,2022-07-10 15:07:24+00:00,RaoulGMI,My basket of Exponential Age growth tech stocks and ETF's which I have start accumulating into this weakness is the most reflective of the future economic reality and thus should outperformed as yields come lower.. https://t.co/IXEkagb9Gk
2577,2022-07-10 15:07:23+00:00,RaoulGMI,"And when we plot asset prices against this, bonds are the standout (they trade above ISM) and tech is the area that has priced in most economic risk. https://t.co/VbicRaLkMA"
2578,2022-07-10 15:07:22+00:00,RaoulGMI,"My forward-ISM indicator suggest that we need to brace ourselves for economic data collapsing fast in the coming months...as the tightest monetary conditions (based on rates, dollar and commodities) take hold and destroy demand. https://t.co/BDmuIZGaIg"
2579,2022-07-10 15:07:21+00:00,RaoulGMI,Oil is trading roughly in line with ISM as it always does...and thus should fall as ISM falls. https://t.co/ZomJ4t0c8d
2580,2022-07-10 15:07:20+00:00,RaoulGMI,And then its oil...the range break will tell us everything and settle for the next 6 to 9 months whether demand trumps supply or supply trumps demand. This is the key battleground. https://t.co/0IueSdrdxj
2581,2022-07-10 15:07:19+00:00,RaoulGMI,The two things that affect this the most are the dollar (the higher it goes the more deflationary pressure it exerts for now). There is a risk of a spike before respite... we probably need to complete the weekly DeMark 9 count first. https://t.co/COMpi4gLbP
2582,2022-07-10 15:07:18+00:00,RaoulGMI,The big question is whether this pattern in yields is a potential H&amp;S top or a correction before higher rates. The balance of probability for me is a break lower. https://t.co/DXYNue36I8
2583,2022-07-10 15:07:17+00:00,RaoulGMI,5 year breakevens look like they have topped out and a break of 250bps will lead to mean reverse back to 150bps maybe (I understand and take on board the complexity of de-globalisation and tight commodity markets). https://t.co/1A2wgF0t8v
2584,2022-07-10 15:07:15+00:00,RaoulGMI,My working hypothesis is that the US economy cant take real rates above the regression channel and that the average (or fair value) of 5 year real rates is around -1% (150bps lower) due to debt and demographics. 1/ https://t.co/TavRgjh0Ma
2585,2022-07-10 14:36:47+00:00,RaoulGMI,@AlderLaneEggs @SBF @SBF_FTX Would love to. What is your difference in view to his outside of Tezos being massively underpriced? Just so I am aware of what the debate is...
2586,2022-07-10 14:26:32+00:00,RaoulGMI,@FalkorLucky @CathieDWood @SantiagoAuFund I think you know that deflation = lower real rates. Thus deflation is good for long duration assets in general (over time).
2587,2022-07-10 14:23:41+00:00,RaoulGMI,"I think this is pretty much spot on and as per my interview with @SBF and my writings in GMI, I think the market is undervaluing having ETH staking yields as benchmark yields against which to measure all other lending risk, which the space desperately needs. #Ethereum"
2588,2022-07-10 14:16:08+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@N1ckB1shop @ChrisManski4 @RealVision Yes but the inflation didn't last long, ISM collapsed to 30 as the market went lower too and then by 1949 inflation was -6%."
2589,2022-07-10 13:32:31+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@paulhodges1 @ericjackson @hussmanjp The inflows are, in my view, established by market makers  to allow their customers to short ARKK as its the only hedge for growth tech. The inflows match well with the short interest increase."

2754,2022-06-29 12:41:48+00:00,RaoulGMI,@lifestylearb Even harder to assess the odds thus increasing the complexity of the situation at hand
2755,2022-06-29 12:34:55+00:00,RaoulGMI,@jajajaja_eth That would be covered under point 6
2756,2022-06-29 12:18:17+00:00,RaoulGMI,"But as ever, one step at a time. We first need to see the rate cycle turn."
2757,2022-06-29 12:18:17+00:00,RaoulGMI,"To me, that is lower rates (I think after fastest rise in history, this is an easier bet), rise in tech (tech trend doesn’t stop even if it gets re-rated more) and some squeezy commodities such as copper."
2758,2022-06-29 12:18:16+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Our job as investors is to hold all these outcomes in our heads, re-assess the odds endlessly and as Druck says, we need to decide what the world will look like in 18 months, not today."
2759,2022-06-29 12:18:16+00:00,RaoulGMI,Let’s see how it pans out but all the loud differences of opinions on FinTwit are a very understandable outcome of the difficulties of assessing the broad probability distribution.
2760,2022-06-29 12:18:15+00:00,RaoulGMI,The leg lower in stocks/crypto if it occurs will give us a lot more informational value as will ISM over next 2 months. The Fed have paused or reversed 100% of the time ISM crosses 50 since 1970.
2761,2022-06-29 12:18:15+00:00,RaoulGMI,As ever I’m waiting for signals from bonds. When the equity/bond correlation reverses then that will call the cycle turn. I.e a leg lower in stocks = lower yields.
2762,2022-06-29 12:18:15+00:00,RaoulGMI,"That is a wide range of outcomes that makes this very tricky to invest in. 

Peak cycle is always the hardest time to get clarity and patience is required."
2763,2022-06-29 12:18:14+00:00,RaoulGMI,6. Recession where real rates need to get to 100bps or more higher to stop the inflation and that destroys everything but pleases those who think rates have been too abnormally low. I don’t put as high a probability on this but it’s possible.
2764,2022-06-29 12:18:14+00:00,RaoulGMI,"5. It’s just a growth scare like 1985, 1987, 1994 and 2016 and recession is narrowly avoided. This is the outcome that would make most people wrong. It’s definitely possible. 2016 caught me off guard for sure."
2765,2022-06-29 12:18:12+00:00,RaoulGMI,"4. Recession is going to be longer and deeper and equities will get re-rated much lower. This is the 2002 redux and 2008. Again, quite probable although I don’t see all conditions in place. This is the VC held view and the value investor view. Growth tech is already -80% tho…"
2766,2022-06-29 12:18:12+00:00,RaoulGMI,3. Recession leads to negative inflation prints in 12 to 18 months as YOY effects of the Covid bullwhip come into play. I have significant sympathy with this view too. This is a repeat of 1947 to 1949.
2767,2022-06-29 12:18:11+00:00,RaoulGMI,2. Recession lowers demand and price rises fall back to the 2% range as 5 yr break evens suggest. The recovery when it comes does see commodity prices firm but % increases aren’t enough to drive inflation (like 2003 to 2008). This is my main view. A short sharp recession.
2768,2022-06-29 12:18:11+00:00,RaoulGMI,1. Recession where inflation is not fully brought to heel and thus rates remain higher for longer and inflation comes back after recession. This is the core FinTwit view and is very reasonable. This is the 1970’s redux view. I think we lack demand for this.
2769,2022-06-29 12:18:11+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Right now there are more realistic possible outcomes than at any time I’ve ever worked in  and as a macro investor my job is to endlessly reassess the odds of the outcomes. Hence why it’s exhausting!

So, what are the main probabilistic outcomes?"

2781,2022-06-28 12:12:04+00:00,RaoulGMI,This storm too shall pass (or may have even passed as peak liquidity tightening has passed too it is very close to it).
2782,2022-06-28 12:12:04+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Remember - LTCM wasn’t the end of arbitrage, equity vol, bond markets or anything. It just moved leverage elsewhere as banks create leverage to make money. That is their sole job.

This is nothing but a bump in the road of digital assets too."
2783,2022-06-28 12:12:03+00:00,RaoulGMI,And we will repeat the same again in a different market ad infinitum.

2787,2022-06-28 12:12:02+00:00,RaoulGMI,"There are many parallels with 3AC and the crypto lending markets. CeFi (not DeFi) clearly had one main client - 3AC, the smartest guys in the room. It appears now that they were the largest driver of CeFi yields…"
2788,2022-06-28 12:12:01+00:00,RaoulGMI,"The losses in excess of investor capital were $4bn. Investors were wiped out and many big banks had huge, huge losses. 

It almost brought down the system at the time, hence the need for the Fed emergency cut in 1998 that fueled the dot com bubble."
2789,2022-06-28 12:12:01+00:00,RaoulGMI,"LTCM blew up, the Fed had to cut rates and Goldman (where I had moved to by then) and others essentially took over the firms positions and unwound the risk to protect themselves at the behest of the NY Fed."
2790,2022-06-28 12:12:01+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Everyone started tightening funding terms and more copycat funds began to fold, pushing out arb spreads further. Then the Street smelled blood and began to hedge exposure by taking the other side of LTCM."
2791,2022-06-28 12:12:00+00:00,RaoulGMI,Then all at once all the investment banks realized that their biggest client was the same one - LTCM. They had around $4bn in capital but they had borrowed hundreds of billions (yup!).
2792,2022-06-28 12:12:00+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Their complex models had failed to capture one key risk - liquidity. 

Their entire strategy was short liquidity. And liquidity was in in very short supply!"
2793,2022-06-28 12:11:59+00:00,RaoulGMI,"At first LTCM added to their trades - this was basically risk free if you had enough capital ! (Or so they thought…)

Surely LTCM were going to clean up as the weakest hands got shaken out?!"
2794,2022-06-28 12:11:59+00:00,RaoulGMI,"As is usual, the funding tightness spread as banks started to get losses from Asia and the next weakest link was found - the risk arb hedge funds. LTCM, having access to more cash and leverage were not the first to go but as smaller funds began to fold, arb spreads widened.."
2795,2022-06-28 12:11:59+00:00,RaoulGMI,"As ever,when the funding tide goes out, the weakest borrowers get hit first. In this case it was the massively over-leveraged Asian economies and it morphed into a global crisis of epic proportions."

We have a high risk of a sharp recession that is over quickly and another risk off. It is not a certainty. The odds of a bigger recession are lower but could change. Inflation is a past problem.

2930,2022-05-30 00:02:53+00:00,RaoulGMI,"This occurred after years of commodity underinvestment. However, inflation rose only 2.4% on average. Globalization helped but we had a weak dollar. They balanced each other out. Demographics and technology were the swing factors. https://t.co/b8U2lRsx5U"

2933,2022-05-30 00:02:50+00:00,RaoulGMI,I think yields have topped or are topping and that will help clarify the picture.

3498,2022-04-24 19:23:11+00:00,RaoulGMI,@DTAPCAP @MichaelKantro 100% agree. See my thread from earlier today…
3499,2022-04-24 17:51:00+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@taillarb Exactly. I’m hoping the timing works well for this, allowing us to buy weakness"

3501,2022-04-24 17:36:28+00:00,RaoulGMI,@jrichlive Agreed. Growth stocks should do very well over time.

3503,2022-04-24 17:29:01+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@jrichlive Yes, it might just be a growth scare, which is typical in early stage recoveries but yield drive inversion suggests more - maybe something like 1990 mild recession that refreshes imbalances. Who knows.."

3510,2022-04-24 15:17:33+00:00,RaoulGMI,"The answer to higher prices is demand destruction. The Fed is a side show as the markets have already taken rates up so far as to invert the yield curve and inflation is acting as a huge monetary tightening...

3511,2022-04-24 15:17:33+00:00,RaoulGMI,"My view is that we are rapidly approaching an inflection point where peak inflation fears give way to lower inflation and fast decelerating growth.

3527,2022-04-24 14:41:07+00:00,RaoulGMI,@neilazous @PeterLBrandt Interesting. I hadn’t seen that. Diamond patterns are usually reversals but we had a huge failed one a few years ago. Definitely worth keeping an eye on

3545,2022-04-22 17:53:20+00:00,RaoulGMI,@AIMInvestor4 @dailydirtnap Cant really tell. I think it will be fine but we need bond yields to fall.

The only place to hide would be the dollar and probably bonds (because everyone is short).

And yes, crypto would get caught up too (not new lows)."

4223,2022-03-10 00:39:09+00:00,RaoulGMI,@jackgermon This is my point - normalised chart. https://t.co/Ch7UBpmOZN
4224,2022-03-10 00:34:18+00:00,RaoulGMI,@FacedSchiff I have not changed my allocation. I use BTC as the benchmark.

4228,2022-03-10 00:29:54+00:00,RaoulGMI,@Roryshannon Yes - 1 or 2 haven't checked. dont check often. Rest is in ETH and a few others. Same
4229,2022-03-10 00:29:04+00:00,RaoulGMI,@HappyInvestor10 See log chart for details - all trend slow and speed up. Its the bigger picture that matters.
4230,2022-03-10 00:28:32+00:00,RaoulGMI,@jackgermon You are making the EXACT same mistake Im talking about. Short term correlation does not equal long term correlation.

4248,2022-03-09 02:01:19+00:00,RaoulGMI,@JDiP09 @TheCryptoSniper @KennyDegu Raising rates does nothing but make it worse. They will ease if credit market seizes

4268,2022-03-08 07:18:28+00:00,RaoulGMI,@pmacaverse It shows the futures markets weren’t prepared for this. Who knows how bad this gets…
4269,2022-03-08 07:14:47+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Of all the crises I’d witnessed, this feels the most like the Asian financial crisis and Russian default of 1998. It’s starts as a slowdown, morphs into a larger event (Thailand in 1997) and ends up as a full liquidity crisis. V different but horrifically similar in other ways."

4325,2022-03-04 16:21:20+00:00,RaoulGMI,"I think it also accelerates green energy commitment, a global deal with Iran and a shift towards Morocco (manufacturing) and Algeria (gas) as regional further splinter into more regionalised supply chains they can control easier (I.e not Russia or China)"
4326,2022-03-04 16:21:19+00:00,RaoulGMI,Europe is now in a hot mess. I think there is a decent chance of MMT style handouts to cover food and energy costs. This could be a global thing. It was the new trick that the governments and CB’s learned in 2020. How else do they deal with the obliteration of household finances?
4327,2022-03-04 16:21:18+00:00,RaoulGMI,The odds of rate hikes are falling fast because hiking rates into a supply shock just exacerbates what is likely to become a global recession as the Russia situation will not get solved fast. Demand will erode fast at these prices too.
4328,2022-03-04 16:21:17+00:00,RaoulGMI,"The massive rise in food and energy prices have caused an enormous tightening of financial conditions, along with the liquidity issues of de-platforming Russia.

If it isn't noise to you, your position is too big for your time horizon. 

Good luck and take a chill pill."
4918,2022-01-08 02:26:26+00:00,RaoulGMI,"After this Amazon went up....fast. 

As BTC is more volatile is goes up more and falls more in corrections.  But as AMZN and other have proven Network Stocks over time see shorter cycles and less downside. I think we are going to see that in BTC &amp; ETH too https://t.co/fOut6ursld"
4919,2022-01-08 02:26:25+00:00,RaoulGMI,"It suggests BTC might even possibly test 30,000 but I doubt it ( I think the sell off is near done) but who the hell knows! Its similar enough for context but never rely on fractals. They are for context only. The BTC fractal is longer in time than AMZN and more volatile."
4920,2022-01-08 02:26:24+00:00,RaoulGMI,And BTC like this... https://t.co/rTrsdgX5Ri
4921,2022-01-08 02:26:23+00:00,RaoulGMI,In the short term 2010 Amazon looked like this... https://t.co/DNWTTYtWaE
4922,2022-01-08 02:26:19+00:00,RaoulGMI,Which rhymes with BTC now... https://t.co/pmgbgZHnas
4923,2022-01-08 02:26:15+00:00,RaoulGMI,I'll leave you with an interesting comparison. Amazon is a Metcalfe's Law stock. Back in 2003 to 2011 it looked like this: https://t.co/ztEY3Q7tkM
4924,2022-01-08 02:26:11+00:00,RaoulGMI,"But that means that real rates likely stay negative or low so risk assets over time remain attractive (barring the noise). If inflation is here to stay which many believe (I don't) then you want to own inflation-projected assets with fundamental drivers (DA's), over time."
4925,2022-01-08 02:26:11+00:00,RaoulGMI,It is also not clear now if the slowing economy will stop rate hikes. This has happened almost after every recession since the 1960's. It takes a few years for the economy to normalise. This time around Im sympathetic to the idea that econ cycles will be more violent and shorter.
4926,2022-01-08 02:26:10+00:00,RaoulGMI,"It's usually when rates have gone too far stocks get hurt, along with other assets. Thus any initial sell off's are usually temporary (on initial fears). And when rates finally have gone too far (and YC inverts), rates get cut and the low in growth stocks/assets is put in again."
4927,2022-01-08 02:26:10+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Maybe the macro weighs on BTC and digital assets as liquidity isg reduced but never listen to consensus in terms of rates, it's usually wrong and network model assets generally do fine with rates rise anyway... This is Amazon. https://t.co/hKafQqNdaf"
4928,2022-01-08 02:26:06+00:00,RaoulGMI,BTC is cheap vs Metcalfe's Law....(and has been for a long time - my guess is because there is less network applications on BTC currently than ML would prefer). https://t.co/ENGecOGKRw
4929,2022-01-08 02:26:05+00:00,RaoulGMI,"In the end, the only technicals that matter (Metcalfe's Law matters more) are:

Log chart
48 month Exponential Moving Average?
Maybe the trend since 2015 (but same as EXPMA).

I seriously doubt the bull market ends at regression trend, it should see higher (1 standard deviation+) https://t.co/vHvwJ34FRK"
4930,2022-01-08 02:26:00+00:00,RaoulGMI,Just a reminder - You cant use daily or weekly charts if your time horizon is years. You're either in this for network adoption over time or you are a trader. I am not a trader in crypto. I can't care less about 50% swings in a 70 vol asset.

5001,2021-12-28 15:50:20+00:00,RaoulGMI,@profgalloway Thanks! I really enjoyed it!
5002,2021-12-28 15:49:26+00:00,RaoulGMI,"The best advice I got was from Paul Tudor Jones who once told me the best investors he knew are those whose investment time horizon matches their idea time horizon.

If your model is based on Metlcalfe's Law for all DA's, then you need to be thinking in years, not weeks or months"
5003,2021-12-28 15:49:25+00:00,RaoulGMI,"New capital will flow in over time and a broader rally, when it arrives, will bring retail investors and a reflexive loop of institutional investors FOMO'ing in.

That day will come. You just have to not over extend yourself, don't use leverage and sit tight. Play the long game."
5004,2021-12-28 15:49:25+00:00,RaoulGMI,"But for the bigger market cap tokens to appreciate, they need new money. This is a market to HODL a broad mix of quality names on top of main core positions and don't try to chase returns unless you know what you are doing..."
5005,2021-12-28 15:49:24+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Over time, the market cap of the entire space keeps growing as the digital asset space gets deeper with more use cases. https://t.co/HKMbRX1h76"
5006,2021-12-28 15:49:23+00:00,RaoulGMI,The other key driver of digital asset prices is the Fed balance sheet. Digital Asset markets peaked when balance sheet expansion peaked in YoY rate of change terms. https://t.co/sMDkIigw7f
5007,2021-12-28 15:49:22+00:00,RaoulGMI,"I think the hedge fund space has been under-allocated capital and markets like these prove that if you can, should should allocate to experts who are focussed 24/7. 

Im biased as Ive set up a fund of crypto hedge funds but I expect a lot more institutional participation in funds"
5008,2021-12-28 15:49:22+00:00,RaoulGMI,Most investors on the fence right now tell me that they fear regulation. That is going to be a feature for a while now too. That will keep institution's out of anything but the larger protocols. It's been easier to allocate to VC to avoid market to market and regulation fears.
5009,2021-12-28 15:49:21+00:00,RaoulGMI,"I don't see stable economic growth and lower inflation for a while so we are going to have to rely on institutions and hedge funds to allocate meaningful capital. I think that is coming and Q1 should confirm that, indeed maybe January, but we have to wait and see..."
5010,2021-12-28 15:49:21+00:00,RaoulGMI,My view is that the key reason the market has seen less retail activity is that wages are rising slower than CPI. The cost of living has gone up dramatically and that has removed the marginal investor from crypto. They just can't afford the disposable income.
5011,2021-12-28 15:49:20+00:00,RaoulGMI,That churning is in fact a sign that the market is broadening out. It also makes it harder to generate alpha as investors now need much more knowledge to generate excess returns.
5012,2021-12-28 15:49:20+00:00,RaoulGMI,This is a good thing for those super focussed on the details of each part of the market but it tends towards a FOMO driven market where late-comers who haven't done their homework get topped and tailed as the market moves to the next thing.
5013,2021-12-28 15:49:20+00:00,RaoulGMI,"All assets which are driven by network effects require the network to grow to rise in value. 

This is why you see explosive price action in projects that suddenly gain network effects as the market decides what has real traction and what hasn't."
5014,2021-12-28 15:49:19+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Many of these L1's also have the same staking + burning dynamic going on but have small market caps, so their prices rise faster if volume picks up."
5015,2021-12-28 15:49:19+00:00,RaoulGMI,"This is creating the rapid rotations as people already in the space shift assets around looking for returns - DeFi then NFT's then L1's.

Lots of churn, net net, no new meaningful increase in market cap - an overall sideways market"
5016,2021-12-28 15:49:18+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Burning + Staking + maintained volume is why ETH has outperformed BTC by 4x in 2021.

But with no net real new capital flowing into the space, attention moves to other chains which also have PoS but earlier network adoption, taking volumes away from both BTC and ETH."
5017,2021-12-28 15:49:18+00:00,RaoulGMI,"But with ETH, higher volumes equal more ETH burned (more demand) and then ETH staking has reduced supply. https://t.co/rWqyPf0TQq"
5018,2021-12-28 15:49:16+00:00,RaoulGMI,But active addresses have stagnated all year as people rotated into different opportunities in this sideways market. https://t.co/bwLSX1oTz2

5020,2021-12-28 15:49:14+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Due to DeFi and NFT's and the stronger narrative around ETH, volumes have remained more elevated... https://t.co/kCNmlAxJFh"
5021,2021-12-28 15:49:13+00:00,RaoulGMI,"If Metcalfe's Law applies then network growth is currently very slow, hence why price is sluggish. 

The same is true of ETH but there is a different factor at play here, hence the outperformance."
5022,2021-12-28 15:49:12+00:00,RaoulGMI,"And if you adjust for price, bigger investors liquidated and have barely returned... https://t.co/cV04aLiv9T"
5023,2021-12-28 15:49:11+00:00,RaoulGMI,But that has been replaced by institutions (here measured by wallets with over $10m - which are rising in general but the numbers are still pretty small). https://t.co/7ohy4ywjYm

5190,2021-12-14 00:54:52+00:00,RaoulGMI,@kpkiwoong Hence why I mentioned it
5191,2021-12-14 00:50:19+00:00,RaoulGMI,@GrumpusAurelius Yup
5192,2021-12-14 00:37:30+00:00,RaoulGMI,"The next phase is the shift from retail to institutional. It’s been building all year but 2022 is the year I think the BIG herd arrives.

However, I am not a guru! Good luck and gn!"
5193,2021-12-14 00:37:29+00:00,RaoulGMI,The long game is all about sizing and watching the charts for fun but not really caring until deeply excessive speculation is rampant (then take 50% or more off and grab stablecoin yields)
5194,2021-12-14 00:37:29+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Or whatever..

We don’t know the short term path but with high odds, we know where is it going.

Again, if you are demanding answers on Twitter as to when the rally might re-commence, you are too exposed."
5195,2021-12-14 00:37:28+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Most of all, don’t get stressed by shorter term moves if you are playing the long game.

If it stresses you, you are too big and it matters to your overall life plans too much. 

We all have a lot riding on this but you can’t weep if it goes down 50% and chops for a year"
5196,2021-12-14 00:37:28+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Unless you are an expert…(I am not)

If you want to use leverage, add small premiums in options that you can write off.

Layer 1’s of BTC, ETH, Luna, AVAX and SOL are the better core holdings.

NFT’s are most speculative but are also innovating fast so have a bit of that too."
5197,2021-12-14 00:37:28+00:00,RaoulGMI,"But that is not now.

Sit tight, add on dips and if we see another sharp rise in the entire space, reduced your more speculative holdings and rotate to higher quality.

Also don’t follow the pump. By the time you get in it’s too late. Be diversified in the small stuff"
5198,2021-12-14 00:37:27+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Plus a rising realization of the importance of Web 3.0 by artists, musicians and brands. Some are cash grabs but many are not.

Some sort of tipping point has been reached…

And I think it accelerates later this month and well into next year, when it might get very frothy…"
5199,2021-12-14 00:37:27+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Remember - digital assets overall have gone nowhere since May unless you were lucky to nail a pump.

But the rally from the July low has seen most digital assets well below their highs.

But meaningful institutional adoption is underway, along with exponential new use cases"
5200,2021-12-14 00:37:26+00:00,RaoulGMI,But we haven’t seen a blow off top with record participation. We have seen speculation of some size in NFT’s but that is mainly people who already have ETH and have profits to burn
5201,2021-12-14 00:37:26+00:00,RaoulGMI,"And many are scarred by past cycles when this point in the halving cycle produced the top.

But past damages to your psyche can also cause you to be excessively cautious in what appears to be an elongated cycle or change of structure"
5202,2021-12-14 00:37:26+00:00,RaoulGMI,"YoY rate of change of Fed balance sheet is also a factor but in past cycles risk on continued in the main.

But a lot is position squaring and rebalancing after a good year of owning risk. Tax selling too.

But my view is that the game hasn’t yet changed…"
5203,2021-12-14 00:37:25+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Wow, everyone has gotten super bearish on everything in digital assets

5856,2021-10-29 02:23:42+00:00,RaoulGMI,@WinePiano Because sometime you want to take risk. I want to take risk because I thing the rewards will compensate for that risk. no one got rich being diversified.
5857,2021-10-29 02:22:02+00:00,RaoulGMI,@hsspac You are confusing a fair value model with price predictions. I have made my predictions very very clear.

5867,2021-10-29 01:47:24+00:00,RaoulGMI,@Crypto_Standard @CathieDWood I was much earlier but later than many.
5868,2021-10-29 01:46:57+00:00,RaoulGMI,@SaguaroSloth Yeah but no. My Alts portfolio is up more than BTC and my ETH is up 4x BTc this year alone.
5869,2021-10-29 01:42:29+00:00,RaoulGMI,@MrGaryWatson @expfunction @sassal0x Indeed.

5872,2021-10-29 01:40:15+00:00,RaoulGMI,@TexasTylerD @Crypto_Los Actually me too!
5873,2021-10-29 01:39:09+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@2abuYounes Shame, It cost you money. I bought BTC in early 2020, it is up a fraction of my ETH bet that I started 6 months later."

5876,2021-10-29 01:34:29+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@tvh44 Actually no. ETH was a far, far better bet."
5877,2021-10-29 01:28:15+00:00,RaoulGMI,@georgi_stanoev NEVER! This is crypto.
5878,2021-10-29 01:27:19+00:00,RaoulGMI,"To be honest and transparent, so I don't pretend I'm good - a whole bunch of my alts are way below ATH's. I dont have much of them but it's a drag on total performance. I switched some but Im ""hoping"" that some play catch up. I dont pretend to get it right always."
5879,2021-10-29 01:20:41+00:00,RaoulGMI,@artaxerxes2000 @decentraland Nope.
5880,2021-10-29 01:20:33+00:00,RaoulGMI,@AndrewCerone I own some.

5882,2021-10-29 01:19:08+00:00,RaoulGMI,@therudysilva It is going to 0.16 or higher.
5883,2021-10-29 01:15:40+00:00,RaoulGMI,@nickrj Not if you think it goes up a lot. Still too cheap vs trend.
5884,2021-10-29 01:15:09+00:00,RaoulGMI,@mr_shickadance_ Because I have been in the trades for a year and people can tell from my RV interviews. Im not trying to pump and dump.
5885,2021-10-29 01:14:24+00:00,RaoulGMI,@ksell14 @RFOX yes.
5886,2021-10-29 01:14:11+00:00,RaoulGMI,@Crypagy Me neither. I do use WhatsApp which is FB too...
5887,2021-10-29 01:13:16+00:00,RaoulGMI,@RobPJS I wasn't watching it. I live in the future in my macro bets so today matters not.

5895,2021-10-29 01:07:20+00:00,RaoulGMI,@Crypto_Los Indeed. FULL APE.
5896,2021-10-29 01:07:03+00:00,RaoulGMI,@c0locho Im long.
5897,2021-10-29 01:05:26+00:00,RaoulGMI,"I'm not shilling them as they are big picture future plays. I am not looking for quick gains in those strategic, undervalued bets so don't follow me in expecting a pump. 

I have no interest in that."
5898,2021-10-29 01:05:26+00:00,RaoulGMI,"I obviously also own BTC and a whole bunch of other crypto (layers 1's, Defi and interoperability stuff). 

I think the most undervalued plays for the future (not now) are @rally_io , @Chiliz , @dapperlabs , @TheSandboxGame , @decentraland , and other metaverse and social tokens"
5899,2021-10-29 01:05:26+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Just so we are clear - I am more than irresponsibly long ETH right now. I now have leverage but via calls. This is by far and away the biggest personal position of my entire life by a factor of 10 (or more). 

My view horizon for this part of the trade is 6 to 9 months."
5900,2021-10-29 00:57:33+00:00,RaoulGMI,@mdudas haha...would have been perfect. They missed the meme opportunity.
5901,2021-10-29 00:36:33+00:00,RaoulGMI,@Bitcoin_Beyond nope.
5902,2021-10-29 00:32:38+00:00,RaoulGMI,@theKnifeKatcher yes.
5903,2021-10-29 00:32:23+00:00,RaoulGMI,@Stormsedge7 Leave your hang ups at home.
5904,2021-10-29 00:31:40+00:00,RaoulGMI,@PatrickLoney0 Watch the interview. Zuck gets it (crypto)
5905,2021-10-29 00:31:16+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@adrupsytov No, Im a realist. Everything will exist together."
5906,2021-10-29 00:16:39+00:00,RaoulGMI,"This is something that is truly exponential. It is the future of everything but you can choose your future and your society that most aligns with you. 

This is the game changer. Don't use your cynicism about Facebook. See the change."
5907,2021-10-29 00:16:38+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Be less cynical and realize that today, the world shifted on its axis. The metaverse is an entire new layer of GDP and has endless possibilities, which ever metaverse experience you choose. 

There is no one metaverse. Like there is no one community, society or country,"
5908,2021-10-29 00:16:38+00:00,RaoulGMI,"If you think crypto has no value, you are wrong. They are the entire building blocks for this new society. 

If you think NFT's have no value, you are wrong. They are everything.

If you think that social tokens have no value, you are wrong. They are the money for these societies"
5909,2021-10-29 00:16:37+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Others will choose to use it and that is their choice. You might not like it but hey, tough shit. It is what it is and it is the future. You get the choice to build or participate in a different set of metaverse experiences.

Maybe Epic games is for you, or somewhere else."
5910,2021-10-29 00:16:37+00:00,RaoulGMI,"This is what adoption looks like - it maybe not what you want, but it is what it is. Again, we have the choice to participate or not. This is very different to the physical world. Your opinion of Meta is just a matter of where you hang out."
5911,2021-10-29 00:16:36+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Make no mistake - Meta/Facebook with Diem and the metaverse experience is a way to onboard billions of people into this world of distributed ledger technology.

You might not like their model. You might be biased as to their actual model. Its too early to tell. But is IS adoption"
5912,2021-10-29 00:16:36+00:00,RaoulGMI,"And all of this is possible because of the key word that Zuck uses - ""interoperability"". Our physical goods and our participation in a digital society will be crypto, NFT's and social tokens. It will all run on blockchain."
5913,2021-10-29 00:16:35+00:00,RaoulGMI,DAO's create opportunities for egalitarian governance. Other metaverse experience will be autocratic. That is fine. We have choices. Easier choices than the physical world.
5914,2021-10-29 00:16:34+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Again, this is like digital sovereign states - but without the restrictions of physical states (at least not yet). Too many people are building out other experiences that will form part of the metaverse that maybe be less monopolist or corporatist. You choose what suits you."
5915,2021-10-29 00:16:34+00:00,RaoulGMI,Apple is building AR at an astonishing rate and will act as the intermediaries between physical and full metaverse. You might not trust apple either. But that is fine...
5916,2021-10-29 00:16:34+00:00,RaoulGMI,"There might be an oligopoly on the largest metaverse experiences, much like there is in gaming and social media, but we are free to move. Some of those societies will extract too much ""rent"" in terms of data or restrictions but we can move elsewhere."
5917,2021-10-29 00:16:33+00:00,RaoulGMI,Meta get that this is not one Ready Player One experience but an interooperable world. You or I might not trust Meta but in this new world we can just take our stuff and go to a digital society that treats us in the way we wish. Much like the internet now but we retain the value.
5918,2021-10-29 00:16:32+00:00,RaoulGMI,"The Zuck video today for Meta might well have been cheesy but it was incredible important...maybe one of the most important things I have seen in years (although something I have expected and written about for a long time).

1/"
5919,2021-10-28 23:32:38+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@Cooopahtroopa Totally agree - in a digital world we will have a choice what digital societies to belong to, some people will babe happy to be part of Meta's world, other won't be and that is perfect but the world is moving fast to Web 3.0 in many different forms."

Its a least  start for RIA's and retail so its better than nothing but it is still rent-seeking more than a BTC ETF would be. So: Good news and expected, but poor executiontion"
6366,2021-10-15 15:19:43+00:00,RaoulGMI,"This is the old financial market trick - you now have to add multiple new intermediaries who all make profits - the ETF provider, clearing house, futures broker, administrator, auditor, law firm, CME and hedge fund arbs. 

Wall street gets richer. Retail investors lose. Again."
6367,2021-10-15 15:19:43+00:00,RaoulGMI,Issuing the BTC futures ETF is a good step but its basically handing hedge funds a massive arbitrage opportunity as the futures will trade at a large premium in bull phases and they get to capture those returns.  1/

6452,2021-10-03 23:54:25+00:00,RaoulGMI,"I know its early days, and so much is unknown.

But all I do know, is that I need to figure it out and fast."
6453,2021-10-03 23:54:24+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Im less interested in the digital scarcity of metaverse clothing, digital luxury good etc etc (even though it is stillsuper interesting). That I get, entirely."
6454,2021-10-03 23:54:24+00:00,RaoulGMI,"I'll try to figure it out on my @RealVision interviews as Im sure many of you feel like outsiders too.

To me, its not about finding an NFT that will make money but culturally significant communities that have a higher probability of success and what that path might look like."
6455,2021-10-03 23:54:23+00:00,RaoulGMI,"And that makes me feel that the NFT movement needs to help others more get to understand how they can be involved and what it all means.

I know @garyvee has been working hard on this @sergitosergito too and @punk6529 but it still feels very inaccessible to many."
6456,2021-10-03 23:54:23+00:00,RaoulGMI,"A bunch of this stuff is a zero and others are cultural phenomena beyond what we understand now. Art has changed forever but Im struggling yet to understand if and how and what communities can organize themselves around all of this.

I can't know with my level of understanding"
6457,2021-10-03 23:54:23+00:00,RaoulGMI,"I also know that this is going to dovetail in with social tokens which are a way to organize complex adaptive societies successfully.

But with NFT's I don't even know where to start...."
6458,2021-10-03 23:54:22+00:00,RaoulGMI,"There is so much going on from online tribes, to digital status, from community formation and organization to incredible art work. I know it's going to take out the music industry and a bunch of other businesses full of intermediaries and legacy rules."
6459,2021-10-03 23:54:22+00:00,RaoulGMI,"And the rest of us feel like we have our nose pressed up again the windows, looking it at everyone having a great time.

If you are not on Discord, and in the ""in"" crowd you literally have no idea how to approach this. Im not on Discord."
6460,2021-10-03 23:54:22+00:00,RaoulGMI,"I totally get it at a relatively superficial conceptual level but the cultural depths and societal implications are something Im trying to catch up with but I know its bigger than Im imagining.

Writing GMI currently and doing work on all of this and this set up for the acceleration phase is as good as I have ever seen.

Buckle up and good luck."
6482,2021-10-02 23:36:50+00:00,RaoulGMI,The outright chart of market cap is ludicrously bullish once it crossed $900m in market cap and will be an acceleration point. Wave 3 in technical analysis term ushered in by this giant cup and handle/wedge. https://t.co/xBfpF7sEcy
6483,2021-10-02 23:36:49+00:00,RaoulGMI,This is total market cap. It is likely ready to move from 2 standard deviation oversold vs trend to overbought. That looks to me that the entire space can 3x into year end and 6x into next year ( I think the cycle extends). https://t.co/BwLayLvbj1
6484,2021-10-02 23:36:48+00:00,RaoulGMI,Im finding it very hard to not get extremely bullish about the next few months. Almost every crypto chart looks coiled and ready for a big move after months of consolidation. Here are the two charts that matter to me right now:

6507,2021-09-29 02:04:45+00:00,RaoulGMI,But if rates then reverse or stabilize it might slow dollar rise. It’s a tight situation and it could also lead to a Goldilocks where rates slow their rise and growth edges lower. Too early to tell.

These levels keep getting rejected but if it breaks up, the inflation and growth pulse will shift downward. If it moves fast, it accelerates this. A slow break is less negative. 1/"

6745,2021-09-21 17:05:49+00:00,RaoulGMI,"The DA industry needs to formally come together and do the same, just as the internet companies did. It's going to cost a lot of money but in the end, where the compromise is made is the difference between a $10trn industry or a $200trn industry. 

That is a hell of a prize."
6746,2021-09-21 17:05:48+00:00,RaoulGMI,"I don't see the US making the same mistakes the EU did with internet companies that essentially forced all innovators abroad. It is not in the US DNA.

Gensler's hard line is the start of a long negotiation. Classic negotiating tactics - start ultra tough then compromise."
6747,2021-09-21 17:05:48+00:00,RaoulGMI,"as with all regulations, there will be regulation arbitrage in different jurisdictions if required.

But regulation IS coming globally and countries that actively encourage these entrepreneurs with lighter regulation will take the lion share of the benefits."
6748,2021-09-21 17:05:47+00:00,RaoulGMI,"But this will take years. The next 3 to 5 years in crypto will be about setting the battle lines and then using the courts and lobbyists to reach a grand settlement of what it means to classify something as a security. In the end, that will help the space and"
6749,2021-09-21 17:05:47+00:00,RaoulGMI,"My view is that in the end, we will get new securities laws for digit assets and that they will be cheaper, faster, fairer and much less onerous on issuers. Consumer protection will have to come via warnings or some sort of risk metrics."
6750,2021-09-21 17:05:46+00:00,RaoulGMI,The madness of all of this is that people are free to bet on sports or throw all their money away in Vegas but can't buy securities. They can lose money in any number of unregulated private transactions.
6751,2021-09-21 17:05:46+00:00,RaoulGMI,"The current system still generally forces individuals to use large financial institutions to get access to investments, keeping the power in these institutions hands.

6754,2021-09-21 17:05:44+00:00,RaoulGMI,"And that also means the frankly ridiculous rules around Accredited Investors or selling securities HAS to change to meet the modern world, not the 1930's world. It is simply inexcusable to allow rich people to get richer and penalising the poorer people who aren't accredited."
6755,2021-09-21 17:05:44+00:00,RaoulGMI,"The reason no one wants to call something a security is that it comes with a HUGE burden in cost, time and access to regular investors. But, pair that all back to create ""innovators regulation"" and layer in KYC, tax compliance and some investor protections and it's a good thing."
6756,2021-09-21 17:05:43+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Digital Assets might well be ""securities"" but the regulation around that will end up being much lighter touch than today. If they try the heavy hand, capital leaves and also the lobbying power of the crypto community is growing every day. Money talks."

7072,2021-08-29 01:32:20+00:00,RaoulGMI,"You will have egg on your face too and people need to accept that part of investing is being wrong... a lot.

Fintwit is full of armchair experts. Ignore them. They haven't done the work. They just have ""opinions"".

Do the hard work and also question what you think you know."
7073,2021-08-29 01:32:20+00:00,RaoulGMI,"The only religion in investing are your results.

Worship those, not your ideas. 

Respect other views (but filter out the noise and learn how to assess when not to filter it out - its very hard but vital).

And just be nice to people who have different views or have been wrong."
7074,2021-08-29 01:32:19+00:00,RaoulGMI,"We all have different views. 

That is good and what makes a market. 

Accept those views and don't feel that you have to defend them as a system of honor. It isn't."
7075,2021-08-29 01:32:19+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Also, if you over complicate analysis, or over analyze, you will more than likely fail in that bet or in investing overall.

I've done that too.

Simplicity of view, more often than not gives better results.

To keep you on the straight and narrow, a chart helps massively."
7076,2021-08-29 01:32:19+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Successful macro investing is all about holding ones view in your head and endlessly assessing the probabilities that you are wrong, without freaking out.

Dogma is the death of investing, as is view paralysis. The other bad one is excessive risk aversion or seeking."
7077,2021-08-29 01:32:18+00:00,RaoulGMI,"But sometimes I've screw that up too - starting an agricultural commodities hedge fund in 2007 was a classic. I didn't understand the impact of technology and prices are down 50% since then. Duh!

There is always something we think we understand but we really don't."

7207,2021-08-20 00:14:03+00:00,RaoulGMI,@allstarcharts Exponential trends over time and bubbles look v similar...makes no difference
7208,2021-08-20 00:11:53+00:00,RaoulGMI,And that is all without using one chart of the Fed balance sheet as a denominator 😜
7209,2021-08-20 00:11:53+00:00,RaoulGMI,It's a new business model - network effects. It forces us to re-think valuation and 30 years of outperformance over time suggests we cant ignore it and write these trends off as bubbles. But they are volatile and that is ok  as there is no reward without risk.
7210,2021-08-20 00:11:52+00:00,RaoulGMI,And Bitcoin is the same...one bubble in 2013 and a mild one. https://t.co/px20u1uvw4
7211,2021-08-20 00:11:49+00:00,RaoulGMI,"And the NDX is the same - one bubble in 2000 and the rest, normal and correctly priced. https://t.co/ERMXUs34cw"

And thus it was exponential in nature and required  log chart to understand....one bubble 2000, the rest normal... https://t.co/PD8NSU5fxS"

7338,2021-08-02 01:41:56+00:00,RaoulGMI,@coloradotravis @SantiagoAuFund We all have different tolerance or fears of risks but they are ours alone.
7339,2021-08-02 01:40:19+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@coloradotravis Indeed. But do we warn everyone of our own risk aversion or do we accept it until it is real and present danger?

7343,2021-08-02 01:20:23+00:00,RaoulGMI,@shrewdinnocence No. That is not how it works. I bought some BTC using Tether for fast transfer. I now own my BTC and it’s in cold storage. Doesn’t affect me
7344,2021-08-02 01:17:36+00:00,RaoulGMI,@LynAldenContact @eric_hart_ Agreed. It’s noise and the market should be given a chance to prove it

7349,2021-08-02 00:31:24+00:00,RaoulGMI,@dpdrza I dont really care? Honestly.
7350,2021-08-02 00:30:13+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@thesithlord66 So, regardless of whether, you are uncomfortable holding BTC? This is ok. This is your own personal risk tolerance."
7351,2021-08-02 00:29:03+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@forexmaxpain Ok, so your perception of the risk is higher than the markets and that is fine. Risk is an individual thing. But a 50% drawdown in an asset that does 213% per annum makes every year a 4:1. Nothing like it exists..."

7353,2021-08-02 00:26:47+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@TradeRunnr And if you believe that, it is ok but it is most likely far from the reality. It is your own aversion to BTC, not the risk that you re actually talking about."

7357,2021-08-02 00:19:38+00:00,RaoulGMI,@eric_hart_ As would we all my friend. no leverage left in the system either.
7358,2021-08-02 00:19:16+00:00,RaoulGMI,@ForwardIsGood And? How does this affect BTC?
7359,2021-08-02 00:18:43+00:00,RaoulGMI,@RealNatashaChe Because it has real value above and beyond the dollar link.
7360,2021-08-02 00:17:19+00:00,RaoulGMI,@MattWhitton7 @michael_saylor Ive used it too.
7361,2021-08-02 00:16:46+00:00,RaoulGMI,@ogajodafoto This market in stable coins is evolving fast because the biggest player is the weakest. That is the beauty of crypto.
7362,2021-08-02 00:16:02+00:00,RaoulGMI,@RealNatashaChe And there doesnt need to be a peg either. It can be 10% below fair value and still be cheaper than not using tether.  The peg thing is nonsense.
7363,2021-08-02 00:13:10+00:00,RaoulGMI,@AOSFund And then what happens? Does it stop the rise of bitcoin? Nope.
7364,2021-08-02 00:12:36+00:00,RaoulGMI,@mdudas Exactly.
7365,2021-08-02 00:12:05+00:00,RaoulGMI,@B_Boy_36 Because its an attack vector that allows them to not invest because they are uncomfortable with it as a technology.
7366,2021-08-02 00:09:56+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Really, you are just expressing your own risk aversion to BTC, not the actual risk to BTC. 

Wildly different things. 

It's ok to not be comfortable with this new technology, but looking for bogeymen everywhere is an expression of your own fears. 

The mirror is a scary place."
7367,2021-08-02 00:09:56+00:00,RaoulGMI,"One day, this too shall pass and the bogeyman will just be exposed as yet another speed bump on the road. Maybe it causes a sharp sell off, maybe not. Who cares...yawn.

To stop an adoption curve like this, you need a whole lot more risk than Tether. https://t.co/IGNAv8IYfP"
7368,2021-08-02 00:09:55+00:00,RaoulGMI,"3/ We all get it but no one here has found a new source of risk the market didn't know.

It has been talked about for 4 years - the people involved! Deltec! the illicit use! the backing isn't 1:1 in cash in a vault guarded by Rottweilers! regulators! blah blah blah blah blah"
7369,2021-08-02 00:09:55+00:00,RaoulGMI,"2/ Life went on. Nothing happened.

If fact, crypto markets do a -70% pretty often and guess what, nothing happens and adoption keeps rising.

When I first learned about Bitfinex's issues BTC was at 6,100. It could now fall 80% and still not hit that."
7370,2021-08-02 00:09:55+00:00,RaoulGMI,"What I really don't get about Tether fears is this:

Let's say its right and Tether implodes to zero. What happens to Bitcoin or digital assets? Down 30% immediately? down 50%? down 60% down 80%?

Ok. Well, we just did that (many tokens were down 80%) and guess what? 1/"

7710,2021-07-20 00:23:39+00:00,RaoulGMI,"And it's clear that ETH's Metcalfe's Law valuation is currently growing faster than anything in the space of this size (maybe Solana, BNB and a few others should be on this chart). https://t.co/knWB3LPqxy"
7711,2021-07-20 00:23:39+00:00,RaoulGMI,Nice to see Goldman figuring out that all crypto are valued on network effects using an approximated Metcalfe's Law model. I published the same work basically in January (and Im sure others did before me). https://t.co/9J1NGQA0XX
7712,2021-07-19 11:43:49+00:00,RaoulGMI,The question is how far growth will moderate. In China the PMI is below 50. My guess is the US/EU etc will see similar... and that will lead to more stimulus. Early days yet but that is my on-going working hypothesis.
7713,2021-07-19 11:43:48+00:00,RaoulGMI,"And the same is true of the dollar, it is a function of the business cycle (dollar inverted on this chart). https://t.co/UdJr3iN4Ys"
7714,2021-07-19 11:43:47+00:00,RaoulGMI,Bond yields rise and fall with the business cycle. The business cycle has peaked and will ease off significantly and so bond yields will fall. https://t.co/HHktZ9QAEi
7715,2021-07-19 11:43:46+00:00,RaoulGMI,Just adding to this thread.... the rise in the dollar and fall in bond yields is all about a moderation in growth. I think it might lead to a growth scare in Q4.

Does the project have provable network effects? Or might it have future network effects? The former suggests higher allocation of risk budget, the latter, less.

In general I see a trend towards less dominance by a few SC’s and more entrants, allowing for risk diversification along with CBDC’s.

8105,2021-07-04 15:47:16+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@Santiag78758327 @profplum99 Yes, but domestic country borrowers with capital restrictions couldn’t switch to other sources. Here crypto markets can move seamlessly from one SC to another. Very different"

8107,2021-07-04 15:44:49+00:00,RaoulGMI,@profplum99 @Santiag78758327 But ED’s are relatively robust due to overall fungibility and ability to hedge. Don’t see this playing out wildly differently. We will see stress on some SC’s (yields rise to compensate) from time to time and people are free to switch unlike countries with cap restrictions
8108,2021-07-04 15:42:02+00:00,RaoulGMI,@evan_lorenz @profplum99 @Santiag78758327 We’ve been through that before and yields rises at a premium to Fed funds etc
8109,2021-07-04 15:41:21+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@Santiag78758327 @HunterMackay4 Yes, same as Eurodollars which are aggregated from all the foreign banks into a  single yield but individual banks abilities to create dollars can be restricted in times of stress. CBDC will likely alleviate some of of this as does more entrants and ecosystem fungibility"
8110,2021-07-04 15:37:12+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@evan_lorenz @profplum99 @Santiag78758327 Yes, agreed.

8514,2021-06-18 03:34:17+00:00,RaoulGMI,@Paolo_Bernardi @coloradotravis That makes sense. They shouldn’t be deemed 100% fungible at all times
8515,2021-06-18 03:33:07+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@coloradotravis @rptavakol Yes, that is a personal risk tolerance which is absolutely normal. I won’t hold a pension for same reason, other see less risk.

8516,2021-06-18 03:30:23+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@coloradotravis Not sure 100% fungibility is the key motivator. It’s not a saving product but a facilitator product in my mind, so +/-10% vs $ and no one cares but let’s see."
8517,2021-06-18 03:25:18+00:00,RaoulGMI,@coloradotravis I’m a not sure you are making the right assumption. I think the market thinks it’s probably worth a dollar but not sure so I’ll slap on some juicy yield. Is the yield enough? We won’t know for a while. My guess is blended yields across stables coins are efficient market pricing.
8518,2021-06-18 03:21:02+00:00,RaoulGMI,@coloradotravis I used to trade foreign capital arbitrage such as South African financial rand vs commercial rand. Cost of capital for non-domestic opportunities were HUGE. You could get 20% returns on low risk arbs knowing there was a potential risk. This is the same in my mind
8519,2021-06-18 03:06:45+00:00,RaoulGMI,@coloradotravis Was an eye opener
8520,2021-06-18 03:05:43+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@coloradotravis Best watch the video. Asian merchant use tether to get around lots of costs (actual and implied) and that is worth more than 10% to them, as one example. Lots of arbs exists because of weird (to us) incentives like this"
8521,2021-06-18 03:02:25+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@coloradotravis No, it isn’t really. They are paying for the functionality but the yield should express the risk of it not being worth a dollar. Pretty normal market function in my view"
8522,2021-06-18 03:00:21+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@coloradotravis Yield comes from demand for stable coins from merchants, market makers, hedgers etc (same as stock borrow or repo).This video really helped me put it together

8525,2021-06-18 02:53:14+00:00,RaoulGMI,@coloradotravis I agree with the $ is not a $ unless it is a $ but do the yields compensate for the risk that a stable coin could be worth less than a buck? My guess is markets aren’t pretty efficient at this in larger financial products but not always. Higher yields = higher risk. 1/

8881,2021-06-06 02:24:49+00:00,RaoulGMI,"As Hunter S. Thompson said ""But the ticket, take the ride"".

Enjoy the wild ride."
8882,2021-06-06 02:24:49+00:00,RaoulGMI,"But my view, for what is is worth (not a lot), is that this up ends not only up ending finance, but most business models too, as value begins to coalesce around community as opposed to corporations and products."
8883,2021-06-06 02:24:49+00:00,RaoulGMI,"In the end, if you want BTC and the digital asset ecosystem to win, you need to be taken seriously, accept criticism and adapt in order to thrive.

These new business champions, less extreme but extremely hard  working, will turn this $2trn to a $100trn asset class and beyond."
8884,2021-06-06 02:24:48+00:00,RaoulGMI,"All the push back on Tether etc is also good, same as ESG. Systems and networks need to get tested by hard questions that annoy many.  It is important. It only creates Lindy Effects if dealt with rationally."
8885,2021-06-06 02:24:48+00:00,RaoulGMI,"That also applies to things we don't perceive as valuable but which may end up valuable. The @lexfridman interview of @VitalikButerin recently showed how open minded the space should be, yet still critical to assess what is real and what is not (whilst still not knowing!)"
8886,2021-06-06 02:24:48+00:00,RaoulGMI,"We also need to answer criticism without offence, trolling, defensiveness and all the other bullshit that comes with insecurity. There is nothing to be insecure about. Same with regulation, CBDC's etc. It is all good. It all helps create value."
8887,2021-06-06 02:24:48+00:00,RaoulGMI,"That includes @elonmusk but his focus on the space, asking the questions and poking at the tribalism is a net positive over the long run, as the space has to adapt if it wants broader adoption. BTC may be pristine but it is only part of the story. We need to keep an open mind."
8888,2021-06-06 02:24:47+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Or the asset managers and hedge funds in the space from @a16z @paradigm and @PanteraCapital  to @arca, @BlockTower or Hyperion Decimus to name but a few.

These firm, amongst many others are the new KEY players. Not me, Max Keiser, Pomp or anyone else."
8889,2021-06-06 02:24:47+00:00,RaoulGMI,"The leadership is now on those who drive broader adoption and solutions for investors and users, be it @Square , @CaitlinLong_ , @billbarhydt , @cz_binance @SBF_Alameda , @coinbase, @krakenfx , @DigitalAssets, @novogratz, @HHorsley, @LukkaTech, @BlockFi, @silvergatebank, etc"
8890,2021-06-06 02:24:47+00:00,RaoulGMI,The negative reaction to some of the more over the top speakers also shows that the space has transitioned from early phase to a more mature adoption phase where individuals create less marginal positive impact and may even have negative impact
8891,2021-06-06 02:24:46+00:00,RaoulGMI,"To be fair, my flippant comments about the BTC conference being a bit cringe was a reflection of the media coverage of the more extreme aspects but the truth is the speakers and many of the attendees are some of the smartest, most interesting forward thinkers Ive ever known."
8892,2021-06-06 01:49:16+00:00,RaoulGMI,@LongShortTrader I’ve never had a problem but to be fair I’m not a power user of Excel. @RemiGMI is and Bloomberg and other data. He will know what’s what. He is in Spain so will be up in a few hours

9102,2021-05-25 22:18:50+00:00,RaoulGMI,@TwainsMustache I think its an investment and has proven to be the best investment of all time and over any 3 year time horizon.
9103,2021-05-25 22:02:12+00:00,RaoulGMI,@TwainsMustache I would love to explain in detail why this is not the case but I fear you won't be so receptive. Im not sure why you are angry about crypto? Investments are not emotional things generally.
9104,2021-05-25 22:00:55+00:00,RaoulGMI,@fluidfxmedia The Wykoff conspiracy stuff is BS in my opinion...
9105,2021-05-25 22:00:09+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@Reboticant @TwainsMustache Not until I want to allocate out of crypto, which is not yet by a long shot."
9106,2021-05-25 21:56:59+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@TwainsMustache Also, what I stake my reputation on personally is my choice. I am happy to do it in this space over a 10 year horizon. My focus won't be solely on it now but it remains the best risk reward and that is what counts to investors."
9107,2021-05-25 21:55:45+00:00,RaoulGMI,@TwainsMustache Thats ok that you dont see it as investible for you. Im cool with that. I am not doing it for subscribers (RV crypto is free). I am doing it because I passionately care about the fastest growing sector of finance in history and the opps it offers. Been in it on/off since 2012.
9108,2021-05-25 21:52:50+00:00,RaoulGMI,@nic__carter @ProfPieters And did the world implode when it happened? Not really. I think that was the key point.
9109,2021-05-25 21:51:15+00:00,RaoulGMI,@TwainsMustache What happens if the world is changing fast with the fastest rate of adoption of any new tech in history? Why not conceive that it is possible?
9110,2021-05-25 21:50:06+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@TwainsMustache I do not believe that to be the case from the thousands of people I have talked to building out this world including banks, asset managers, hedge funds, entrepreneurs, media, etc. And is grows year after year. And if you are wrong?"
9111,2021-05-25 21:43:40+00:00,RaoulGMI,@TwainsMustache We have a separate crypto channel so 90% of all content on regular RV is non-crypto... we probably have more of a UX / content org issue maybe?
9112,2021-05-25 19:28:49+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@AndreasSteno Again, depends how it is collateralised. Crypto does it entirely differently and borrowing lending didn't sieze at all."
9113,2021-05-25 19:28:12+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@darioperkins @AndreasSteno Ah, there is HUGE leverage across the crypto system but its dealt with differently as its over-collateralised and thus doesn't call on base layer collateral or margin collateral. The point it that is doesn't affect the current system by design."

9118,2021-05-25 12:47:55+00:00,RaoulGMI,"This is what I first saw in crypto back in 2012. A new, anti-fragile financial system that doesn't break in times of stress, where ownership of assets is clear and losses are not mutualised to tax payers.

This was a big two weeks for crypto and for the future financial system."
9119,2021-05-25 12:47:55+00:00,RaoulGMI,"No one had open ended losses.
The system didn't break.
It offered zero systemic risk to the broader financial world.

Speculators lost money and that is it."
9120,2021-05-25 12:47:55+00:00,RaoulGMI,"There were no daisy chains of collateral losses.
There was no collateral pressure.
Stablecoins remained stable.
A few exchanges went down for an hour or two. No exchange big losses occurred, no need to mutualise losses either.
No protocol failed. 
No firms needed rapid funding."
9121,2021-05-25 12:47:55+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Beneath the head line:

Crypto had a major, major VAR-shock test and NOTHING happened. 

Leverage liquidation was offset by overcollateralisation. No one was left holding the baby. 
No firm went under.
The Fed didn't need to step in.
Defi didn't break and carried on near normal"
9122,2021-05-25 12:47:54+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Something to get your head around:

Head Line:

A major asset class crashed 42% in 14 days, wiping out $1.02trn in value in an orgy of liquidation of people up to 100 x levered, with very low regulation. Many tokens fell up to 70%, including unregulated lending and borrowing biz."

9171,2021-05-24 14:34:46+00:00,RaoulGMI,"This is why the price is volatile but exponential over time. 

It will be the same with all the other new technologies too that are seeing massive network effects."
9172,2021-05-24 14:34:45+00:00,RaoulGMI,Then you need to add in the effect of Diem and CBDC's which create even larger networks that interoperate with the digital asset world.
9173,2021-05-24 14:34:45+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Considering the chart above assumes a slowdown in adoption as more people come in, the only question you really need to ask yourself is whether adoption is going to slow massively or not. Even if we slow to 63% per annum, we still get to a billion users by 2026."
9174,2021-05-24 14:34:44+00:00,RaoulGMI,This concept in crypto can be best represented by this chart. Already it is the fastest rate of adoption of any technology in human history (113% per annum vs 63% for the internet). https://t.co/XDeEPj2cPU
9175,2021-05-24 14:34:43+00:00,RaoulGMI,"As long as the participants in the network keep growing over time, the value of the network rises exponentially..

Debasement is the enemy, and an overhaul of the global economy is the prize. It's a fine line.

We can hedge the risk with Bitcoin."

10850,2021-03-10 16:30:30+00:00,RaoulGMI,@ZebJaffer Cant fault him for his cohones...
10851,2021-03-10 16:29:50+00:00,RaoulGMI,@AriDavidPaul This is crucial... great point Ari.
10852,2021-03-10 16:29:18+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Bizarrely, I've made some of the best connections ever over LinkedIn (often from FinTwit people) but I also get a shit load of spam and junk. This one wins this week: https://t.co/TFn0L0VEyO"
10853,2021-03-10 14:23:08+00:00,RaoulGMI,This is a unique format for written discussion. David and I conclude our discussion about bubbles...
10854,2021-03-10 03:37:02+00:00,RaoulGMI,@postmodernFX sorry...
10855,2021-03-10 03:27:50+00:00,RaoulGMI,@Galactic_George Yes.
10856,2021-03-10 03:25:25+00:00,RaoulGMI,@PureAlpha604 @AndurandPierre I just have... we had a fabulous conversation for Real Vision...
10857,2021-03-09 22:54:39+00:00,RaoulGMI,@RealVisionBot The Hive Mind is KILLING it. The value of the collective wisdom of RV members is really incredible.
10858,2021-03-09 22:51:36+00:00,RaoulGMI,@tomcorvid OMG - its better than the chart too!
10859,2021-03-09 22:48:22+00:00,RaoulGMI,@billbarhydt @RealVision My pleasure! The comments section on your interview is pretty insane. I think you were quite the crowd pleaser...
10860,2021-03-09 22:47:37+00:00,RaoulGMI,@CardanoDan ICE futures exchange.
10861,2021-03-09 22:47:11+00:00,RaoulGMI,@newportedge1 Futures is the only way.
10862,2021-03-09 22:46:53+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@tomcorvid Oops. I also asked FinTwit a few weeks ago and part from a few in that market, no one knows about it..."
10863,2021-03-09 22:46:00+00:00,RaoulGMI,@marcvanderchijs Agreed. They've just gotten the incentives right and this will play out to 2030.
10864,2021-03-09 22:42:42+00:00,RaoulGMI,@burnsr92 Fascinating.
10865,2021-03-09 22:39:20+00:00,RaoulGMI,@half_Job_Rob It is set up like a crypto with reducing supply and increasing demand and a rules based system. Fascinating...
10866,2021-03-09 22:38:34+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@deyonte_omari @LynAldenContact @pvctrading I understand. In 2017 BTC had the forks. Similar but not the same. If it survives, it thrives - typical S-curve moment."
10867,2021-03-09 22:35:46+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@TuMintu EU EUA futures are the single best way, bar none."
10868,2021-03-09 22:32:45+00:00,RaoulGMI,"There are two absolutely killer interviews on this - the leading research team in the space and the worlds most famous energy hedge fund manager too.

I'll be writing it up fully for Real Vision Pro too... (using the GMI article)."
10869,2021-03-09 22:32:44+00:00,RaoulGMI,Here is an except from my full GMI article from end of Feb. https://t.co/RvsoKzJ9AQ
10870,2021-03-09 22:32:43+00:00,RaoulGMI,"You'll be soon hearing on Real Vision a lot about one of the greatest macro trades no one is involved in (and is pretty much uncorrelated with everything else) - EU EUA Futures (Carbon Emissions). One of the best charts ever, with one of the best supply/demand backdrops ever. https://t.co/JSnTkA8MvD"
10871,2021-03-09 22:19:12+00:00,RaoulGMI,@LynAldenContact Great article. Feels like you have edged a bit towards my perspective on ETH having potential network effects too but for different reasons.
10872,2021-03-09 22:15:15+00:00,RaoulGMI,@RealVision It looks like EU ETS futures but could be uranium (done without cheating on my Bloomberg).
10873,2021-03-09 19:54:30+00:00,RaoulGMI,@PriapusIQ @RealVision Shout at Our tech and finance guys...they are still getting it sorted out!
10874,2021-03-09 19:53:35+00:00,RaoulGMI,This was another really interesting interview with one of the earliest adopters of the space. What they are doing on global finance inclusion is really incredible...

10894,2021-03-08 22:29:19+00:00,RaoulGMI,@PeterMcCormack haha...made me chuckle.
10895,2021-03-08 21:32:33+00:00,RaoulGMI,But especially for @PeterMcCormack its -26% versus ETH https://t.co/4fEmSllsXs

+75% versus the S&amp;P 500.. https://t.co/t2WqW1bOkH"
10904,2021-03-08 21:09:55+00:00,RaoulGMI,Definitely worth your time...
10905,2021-03-08 20:00:30+00:00,RaoulGMI,@PeterLBrandt Watching closely ! Agree on all
10906,2021-03-08 19:25:14+00:00,RaoulGMI,@jnordvig makes sense.

10909,2021-03-08 16:53:01+00:00,RaoulGMI,Let's see how it plays out...
10910,2021-03-08 16:53:01+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Gold has a high chance of reversing around here... but if it doesn't, we might see a full wash out of speculative positions. https://t.co/j9Hutz3yXO"

10912,2021-03-08 16:52:58+00:00,RaoulGMI,Add to that the Daily DeMark signal tomorrow... https://t.co/wl2fUcFZu4
10913,2021-03-08 16:52:57+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Gold - At the last chance saloon? Gold is now ignoring the dollar, rates and any other correlation and just falls every day. It is approaching monumental support... https://t.co/JbJ1yvMmKP"

10918,2021-03-08 02:36:20+00:00,RaoulGMI,@BtcLiberty @PrestonPysh @chigrl Just remember I coined the terms “pristine collateral” for Bitcoin and “personal reserve asset”
10919,2021-03-08 02:33:33+00:00,RaoulGMI,@EasySimon @OrangePilledca @PrestonPysh @chigrl Haha

10921,2021-03-08 02:29:55+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@jfhksar88 Ok, halve it and halve it again. Odds still work..."
10922,2021-03-08 02:29:25+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@PrestonPysh @chigrl Dunno about that as if it worked, go,d would be money and we’d be looking at a BTC vs gold switch now. Also, money is not what I’m talking about, it’s the platforms for digital value transfer, storage, etc and they can operate on multi-platforms with BTC base layer as money."
10923,2021-03-08 02:26:08+00:00,RaoulGMI,@UfukIncePhD @satonomics @JeffBooth That makes literally zero sense...
10924,2021-03-08 02:25:14+00:00,RaoulGMI,@jfhksar88 Ok. I’ll take the odds of upside of $1m vs downside of $10k or whatever (even zero) aaallll day. Optionality...
10925,2021-03-08 02:13:05+00:00,RaoulGMI,@DanetteWallace @PrestonPysh @chigrl Definitely
10926,2021-03-08 02:05:44+00:00,RaoulGMI,@OrangePilledca @PrestonPysh @chigrl yup.
10927,2021-03-08 02:03:07+00:00,RaoulGMI,@DanetteWallace @PrestonPysh @chigrl I am platform agnostic.
10928,2021-03-08 02:02:47+00:00,RaoulGMI,@Aqloe5 @PrestonPysh @chigrl That is just one example...
10929,2021-03-08 02:02:22+00:00,RaoulGMI,@mirraeinc @PrestonPysh @chigrl Of course.. money laundering is rife in art as it is in everything... including second hand boat sales.
10930,2021-03-08 02:01:39+00:00,RaoulGMI,@OrangePilledca @PrestonPysh @chigrl Ok boss. You run with that. I'll run with a multi-operable world. I think we will both make money.
10931,2021-03-08 02:00:20+00:00,RaoulGMI,@crypto_bitco_ @PrestonPysh @chigrl I don't know.
10932,2021-03-08 01:58:29+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@PrestonPysh @chigrl Just be open to possible alternative futures where value is accretive across an entire ecosystem, not just one protocol. It is undeniably possible and you might want to keep an eye on it."
10933,2021-03-08 01:56:52+00:00,RaoulGMI,@crypto_bitco_ @PrestonPysh @chigrl Rally.
10934,2021-03-08 01:51:04+00:00,RaoulGMI,@sharadv @robertreidmd @PrestonPysh @chigrl Agreed. We have only just stated to understand the possibilities.
10935,2021-03-08 01:50:25+00:00,RaoulGMI,@PrestonPysh @chigrl That is just one potential future. It may or may not accrue on BTC blockchain but it will be interoperable. It is very early and will go through and boom bust cycle but its fascinating. Wait until influencer communities tokenise at scale too. All coming...
10936,2021-03-08 01:45:00+00:00,RaoulGMI,@robertreidmd @PrestonPysh @chigrl You can do that too. You can print it and display it AND own the original.
10937,2021-03-08 01:41:54+00:00,RaoulGMI,@thegreencarpet7 I understand that. It just has a LOT less capital so doesn't drive returns.
10938,2021-03-08 01:39:51+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@PrestonPysh @chigrl Do you see the value in digital art or digital assets for creators, IP, and communities etc or are you not keen on them conceptually?"
10939,2021-03-08 01:35:14+00:00,RaoulGMI,@EasyHomes @chigrl Or to source liquidity...by democratising ownership.
10940,2021-03-08 01:33:27+00:00,RaoulGMI,@EVMacro @chigrl Game changer.
10941,2021-03-08 01:31:36+00:00,RaoulGMI,@wallstcass @Pats12P @chigrl Damian Hirst as well.
10942,2021-03-08 01:28:47+00:00,RaoulGMI,@EVMacro Indeed. Came to that realisation a while ago...
10943,2021-03-08 00:33:47+00:00,RaoulGMI,@Pats12P @chigrl Didn't you even watch the video?
10944,2021-03-08 00:27:50+00:00,RaoulGMI,@Chriso19701 @chigrl That is art in itself.
10945,2021-03-08 00:21:00+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@jgharris7 @a_afpyatt Actually, this is not factual."
10946,2021-03-08 00:17:47+00:00,RaoulGMI,This is where the world is going. The meta verse - and it has more value than anyone realises as yet. Everything physical can be rebuilt in the virtual world in beautiful and unique ways. Art is one application. h/t @chigrl
10947,2021-03-08 00:08:46+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@a_afpyatt @statusquont @trevormwills @BitwiseInvest Ingore the comment above - Bitwise doesn't ""pick"" anything. It is just an index fund based on market cap and tradability. XRP was removed due to tradability."
10948,2021-03-08 00:01:24+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@TChristian74 Yes, I agree to a certain extent. The space tends to end up overpricing in boom phases, then reverting to underpricing, before rising again."
10949,2021-03-07 23:56:25+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@peacock_matt23 Dunno - Blackrock own it. Im speaking to a lot of bit traditional funds who are getting set to buy it. You firm will follow, as they all will... but our time. And that creates a more robust market."
10950,2021-03-07 23:35:45+00:00,RaoulGMI,@ritholtz I prefer the hard core 70's look of the green... its different
10951,2021-03-07 23:35:04+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@a_afpyatt @trevormwills @statusquont @BitwiseInvest It should also read ""passive"" not ""massive""! Yes, makes it super easy and you don't need to choose any tokens but will get exposure as the space develops. Easy peasy."
10952,2021-03-07 23:07:34+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@TChristian74 No, almost all manias that revert to zero are just price-value systems as opposed to true network effects which have network value. Its very very different."
10953,2021-03-07 22:57:49+00:00,RaoulGMI,@a_afpyatt @trevormwills @statusquont Easiest thing - buy the @BitwiseInvest Crypto Index fund and have every outcome covered by a massive investment that means you always own the top tokens.

10966,2021-03-07 17:48:24+00:00,RaoulGMI,@K3vgee You clearly didn't read the thread and reflect on your biases in a proudly evolving world..
10967,2021-03-07 17:40:13+00:00,RaoulGMI,@CBoothStuntman I think this s the s-curve and we go through repeated s-curves
10968,2021-03-07 17:35:31+00:00,RaoulGMI,@YouCantStopUsss Its fallen 90% before and survived.
10969,2021-03-07 17:34:41+00:00,RaoulGMI,@swissclive Indeed. The meta verse and the crypto verse have now met.

With that thinking almost everything reverts to a mean of zero (""it is just Beanie Babies!""). But that misses the fact that even if some, or many project fail, many others are truly building network effects over time"

11061,2021-03-03 16:07:00+00:00,RaoulGMI,@manuelvlara I agree and there is almost no wage inflation in real terms. Have written extensively about this and posted here on it too.

11063,2021-03-03 15:53:06+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Im just thinking out loud but I think that we are looking at the wrong denominator and when we look at it in central bank balance sheet terms, the world makes a lot more sense and gives us clues how to allocate capital to create and preserve wealth."
11064,2021-03-03 15:53:06+00:00,RaoulGMI,"It suggests Real Estate has not been a great store of value overall.

Gold is suffering a similar fate, which is frustrating a lot of people, but my guess it will mean revert in due course and stabilise in SoV terms."
11065,2021-03-03 15:53:05+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Equities will climb as the balance sheet climbs. 

They will continue to offset currency debasement. 

Tech will outperform over time. EM too, most likely.

Fiscal + YCC will increase the BS, so equities over time will likely rise in dollar terms (but not BS terms)."
11066,2021-03-03 15:53:05+00:00,RaoulGMI,"So, what does this all mean? 

We are looking at the wrong denominator for assets, as I have suggested before.

Broad based equities and Real Estate have trodden water since 2008, which makes total sense. To me it confirms the truthiness of this much used chart of Fed BS v SPX. https://t.co/ud2aIKifqM"
11067,2021-03-03 15:53:04+00:00,RaoulGMI,That makes total sense considering we are in the Technology Age and the pace of innovation and disruption of old industries is blistering and exponential.

11076,2021-03-03 15:52:55+00:00,RaoulGMI,"But when we change the denominator to the G4 Central Bank Balance sheets, we can see that equities have traded sideways since 2008, basically counteracting the balance sheet expansion (and are probably cheap currently as 0.15 appears to be the mean) https://t.co/OqC9Nor4gz"

11440,2021-02-22 18:43:19+00:00,RaoulGMI,@fullvessell Seems to work.. no idea.
11441,2021-02-22 17:57:52+00:00,RaoulGMI,"I've written a whole piece on this for Real Vision Pro. The narratives on all sides are so far behind how fast things are moving and how many network effects are combining.

I've literally never seen anything like it..."
11442,2021-02-22 17:57:52+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Everything in the digital asset space is driven by network effects and all those individual networks create a super network effect all the entire space.

DA's = $1.7tn right now. There is room for a 100x or 200x increase over the next 10 years (with big ups and owns on route)."
11443,2021-02-22 17:57:52+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Digital assets are so damned unique in that the users and the owners of the asset are the same, so users get rewarded as owners of the network effects, making them super powerful network effect multipliers."
11444,2021-02-22 17:57:51+00:00,RaoulGMI,"But, the trend actually keeps rising...there is no reversion to a linear trend unless the digital asset fails to gain network effects (and many will fail to)."
11445,2021-02-22 17:57:51+00:00,RaoulGMI,"People find it extremely hard to hold onto exponential trends because we are programmed to think it mean-reverts, but it doesn't. Upside price dislocations are the norm when network effects take hold and bring speculation with it (that fuels the bear markets)"
11446,2021-02-22 17:57:51+00:00,RaoulGMI,"BTC is currently nearly 600% above its 300 week EXPMA. It normally hits 1000% or more when all said and done, before correcting (and that's a long way from here considering the EXPMA is rising now too and will continue to do so)."
11447,2021-02-22 17:57:51+00:00,RaoulGMI,https://t.co/M0W8MkCA1r
11448,2021-02-22 17:57:50+00:00,RaoulGMI,"But Exponential trends revert back to their exponential moving average, not price trend. This is crucial to understand. Because BTC is the network effect of money, it gets speculative and overshoots and corrects to 300 week EXPMA, before rising again."
11449,2021-02-22 17:57:50+00:00,RaoulGMI,This is why you'll see lots of experienced investors hop off the trend early and look for bearish outcomes. Its normal behaviour even in highly experienced investors.
11450,2021-02-22 17:57:50+00:00,RaoulGMI,"But digital assets are EXPONENTIAL trends driven by network effects. These are powerful long-term secular shifts are very different in nature to linear trends. As investors, we really aren't experienced in this, in general. So we apply our old bubble framework and it doesn't work"
11451,2021-02-22 17:57:49+00:00,RaoulGMI,A classic example would be the 1980 silver bubble that eventually reverted back to price trend. https://t.co/P7t8AhYqH7
11452,2021-02-22 17:57:48+00:00,RaoulGMI,Hopefully this is useful for people who struggle with BTC's price action. To most is looks like a bubble because we are trained in mean-reversion (i.e. this time is not different) of linear-trend assets. 1/

11456,2021-02-22 14:28:05+00:00,RaoulGMI,It it just me that feels relief when the BTC sell offs come? You know they are coming but when they finally arrive you can switch into buy the dip mode. March is a historically weak month. Not sure if this is the bigger March correction of just another cheeky shakeout . https://t.co/GMH7evctX5

1. I am not predicting $1m by end of year. Im merely showing that it's more possible than most expect.

2. Im not a ""Goldman Sachs hedge fund manager"" (check the bio on LinkedIn for accuracy).

3. Im not a billionaire.

13284,2020-12-31 17:54:43+00:00,RaoulGMI,"2021 will likely be another big macro year... 

I don't think it will be a set it and forget it year, outside of crypto (and buying dips), but new secular trends are likely to begin to emerge, which we can capture in the years ahead - be it emerging markets or something else."
13285,2020-12-31 17:54:43+00:00,RaoulGMI,"As a macro guy, if I see something that big with that good a risk reward, most other trades become a distraction. 

Sometimes, laser focus is the single most important thing to do."
13286,2020-12-31 17:54:43+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Im sorry for all of you who got fed up with my increasing focus on Bitcoin, but I built my thesis in March/April that it would be the most dominant trade we've ever seen over the next 18 months and that the returns would dwarf any other assets."
13287,2020-12-31 17:54:43+00:00,RaoulGMI,"I've tried really hard to add value where I could because that is what creates a vibrant community, where everyone tries to add value in their own way. 

I've nailed some really big macro themes and got the dollar totally wrong too, but overall its been a banner year."
13288,2020-12-31 17:54:42+00:00,RaoulGMI,"We've even had fun nights on Friday night booze Twitter (Asia/Oz/NZ Saturday hangover Twitter). We've both kept each other sane over 2020 and driven each other mad, like a family. We've also enjoyed making fun of each other too and not taking ourselves too seriously."

14813,2020-11-29 02:09:53+00:00,RaoulGMI,@Andrewstotle @RudyHavenstein He doesn't do bitcoin twitter...he is too old.
14814,2020-11-29 02:09:27+00:00,RaoulGMI,@Takeshi_6102 @alotoftom Good.
14815,2020-11-29 02:09:09+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@BitcoinTina @dtohrofl @coryklippsten @btcmoonguy @ZackG1982 No one says they are money!!!! they are assets. They represent a share of a blockchain that is being used. The more demand, the more they are worth. If they aren't in demand, they will fail."
14816,2020-11-29 02:07:26+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@skwp @Takeshi_6102 Yes, you do. Its the issue with bearer assets. That too needs solving."
14817,2020-11-29 02:06:43+00:00,RaoulGMI,@Takeshi_6102 @skwp Like ETH?
14818,2020-11-29 02:06:22+00:00,RaoulGMI,@Andrewstotle LOL
14819,2020-11-29 02:06:04+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@Takeshi_6102 @alotoftom Really, is that the way you'd speak to him at  party? No."
14820,2020-11-29 01:54:48+00:00,RaoulGMI,@skwp @Takeshi_6102 Not proven.
14821,2020-11-29 01:54:33+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@skwp @Takeshi_6102 Yes, but when things go horrible wrong, proven ownership is useful See Lehman for details."
14822,2020-11-29 01:53:36+00:00,RaoulGMI,@davthewave I hope Im neither...
14823,2020-11-29 01:51:56+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@coinableS No, you are talking money, Im talking tokenization of assets."
14824,2020-11-29 01:51:27+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@OptimistLib @Santiag78758327 No, just because it works well for this in some cases."
14825,2020-11-29 01:50:53+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@Takeshi_6102 @skwp Because trusted ownership is an issue in legacy financial architecture and owners aren't owners. Also, it helps to fractionalize assets that are too expensive for less well off and you need secure ownership."
14826,2020-11-29 01:49:45+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@MAGABTC1M @btcmoonguy @coryklippsten @ZackG1982 By the word ""shitcoins"" you are suggesting that they are the sane but worse than BTC. That is not what they are at all. They are no threat, they are digital assets, not money or collateral."
14827,2020-11-29 01:48:27+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@OptimistLib @Santiag78758327 No, you are using BTC framing again."
14828,2020-11-29 01:47:46+00:00,RaoulGMI,@BaruchAssault That is my goal and has always been ...
14829,2020-11-29 01:47:26+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@OptimistLib @Santiag78758327 it is being used by many people for remittance not MEX, Philippines etc. It is not my focus but I do know enough to know that claiming it has no use cases is misguided."

14831,2020-11-29 01:45:54+00:00,RaoulGMI,@cryptocomicon Nah. You dont know me. You are making assumptions based on your own beliefs. Maybe look at my work?
14832,2020-11-29 01:45:19+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@_Checkmatey_ @cryptocomicon if everyone wants it to be accepted as the future, it will be regulated and fiancialised!"
14833,2020-11-29 01:44:29+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@coinableS So, lets start with the first bit. Who cares if it is centralized if it is perceived to be of value? Apple is centralized. It is NOT bitcoin and to compare them is ridiculous. And I have no view yet on XRP."
14834,2020-11-29 01:43:21+00:00,RaoulGMI,@_Checkmatey_ @cryptocomicon If everyone is a libertarian then they should be tolerant of competition in all senses. Anything else isn't libertarian.
14835,2020-11-29 01:42:31+00:00,RaoulGMI,@OptimistLib @Santiag78758327 It is a stake in a finite blockchain that may or may not accrete value over time.
14836,2020-11-29 01:41:45+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@Takeshi_6102 @skwp I understand that it is possible, I also understand that many many token might well offer a different, non-competitive value prop to bitcoin and may well do very well indeed in a digital future."
14837,2020-11-29 01:37:26+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@MAGABTC1M @btcmoonguy @coryklippsten @ZackG1982 maybe, to blow your mind, they are not competition to bitcoin but tokens with different value propositions?"
14838,2020-11-29 01:36:39+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@BitcoinTina @coryklippsten @btcmoonguy @ZackG1982 Leave the last sentence off, its unnecessary. The rest I Love!"
14839,2020-11-29 01:36:03+00:00,RaoulGMI,@OptimistLib @Santiag78758327 Imaginer you started a business and people bought your product and you made money? Wow.
14840,2020-11-29 01:35:23+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@HodlMagoo If you honestly think your future include paying no taxes to any state you are misguided. Also, I pay taxes in Cayman but different ones to you. We pay work permits, import during, licenses, etc."

14847,2020-11-29 01:28:23+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@xDreamCoding Maybe. Maybe not. I haven't learned enough but I reject anyone who says it is without concrete reasoning, not ""they own the coins, pre-mined"" and ""its not fully distributed"". that is using a BTc framework to analyze something different."

14853,2020-11-29 01:20:41+00:00,RaoulGMI,@OptimistLib Yup.
14854,2020-11-29 01:20:23+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@coryklippsten @btcmoonguy @ZackG1982 Ok. But you are DEAD wrong. Our objective is to help the entire digital asset space knowledge grow. We are agnostics, as is RV overall in macro."
14855,2020-11-29 01:19:22+00:00,RaoulGMI,@OptimistLib @BitcoinTina There are lots of people using it... remittances for one.
14856,2020-11-29 01:14:55+00:00,RaoulGMI,@OptimistLib Remittances for one. huge market.
14857,2020-11-29 01:14:33+00:00,RaoulGMI,@SenorHodl @coryklippsten @ZackG1982 100% agree. Without question.
14858,2020-11-29 01:14:11+00:00,RaoulGMI,@btcmoonguy @coryklippsten @ZackG1982 Explain. Lets use the nice rules so we can discuss....
14859,2020-11-29 01:13:40+00:00,RaoulGMI,@SenorHodl @coryklippsten @ZackG1982 Agreed. all of these things are call options on potential future outcomes.
14860,2020-11-29 01:13:10+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@BitcoinTina You might not think its necessary and that is absolutely valid but others think that tokens with different uses have value and that is fine too. Doesn't take anything away from BTC, which we all love."
14861,2020-11-29 01:12:12+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@OptimistLib No one cares about ripple., its the utility you the blockchain people want a stake in or dont. Im my world, if you think it is worthless, short it."
14862,2020-11-29 01:10:30+00:00,RaoulGMI,@Takeshi_6102 Well the tribalism and anted for different thoughts aint my idea of a beautiful places. Feels like authoritarianism to me.
14863,2020-11-29 01:09:26+00:00,RaoulGMI,@btcmoonguy @coryklippsten @ZackG1982 Just dont sell them. I dont. Whats the problem&gt; Is Apple a scam because they might want you to exchange your bitcoin for their shares? No.
14864,2020-11-29 01:08:39+00:00,RaoulGMI,@OptimistLib I dont know as I haven't done any work on it. I literally only even knew what projects were running on it last week...
14865,2020-11-29 01:08:03+00:00,RaoulGMI,@BitcoinTina Im all about humility because I dont claim to know the truth.
14866,2020-11-29 01:07:35+00:00,RaoulGMI,@fed_speak @SuperMugatu @patrick_oshag Agreed.
14867,2020-11-29 01:06:08+00:00,RaoulGMI,@SuperMugatu @patrick_oshag no golf clubs or stupid carts. That is a good start...
14868,2020-11-29 01:04:37+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@surfglare Ok, that stopped me in my tracks. You know how to get my attention."
14869,2020-11-29 01:04:07+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@OptimistLib No, it is a share of the blockchain and the bet is whether it get used enough to accrue value or not. Who the fuck knows? Maybe?"
14870,2020-11-29 01:03:25+00:00,RaoulGMI,@OptimistLib That is unles the can create value. That reminds to be seen but that is the bet implicit in the tokens.
14871,2020-11-29 01:02:45+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@Takeshi_6102 JFC, they are not BTC competition, Chill. They are different things. No one is threatening you or your bag."
14872,2020-11-29 01:01:37+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@nathansobo @OptimistLib agreed. I just dont have the time right now, running 2 companies"
14873,2020-11-29 01:00:58+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@coryklippsten @ZackG1982 Perfect. I love it too and see possible futures, so why hate everything else?"
14874,2020-11-29 01:00:03+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@OptimistLib Ok. lets try this. Imagine you started a company and over time you sold more share but a limited amount, when you needed or want to raise capital. Does that make you a scam or an entrepreneur? The market sets the price."
14875,2020-11-29 00:57:49+00:00,RaoulGMI,@PriceSmith8 maybe people buy stocks because they like the companies?
14876,2020-11-29 00:56:46+00:00,RaoulGMI,@ZackG1982 @coryklippsten @Breedlove22 @danheld @pierre_rochard @PrestonPysh @parkeralewis @nic__carter I am friends with them all and we have chatted.
14877,2020-11-29 00:56:19+00:00,RaoulGMI,@OptimistLib yu. Competition. They'd have to pre-mine it all first so we knew the total supply however.
14878,2020-11-29 00:55:18+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@PriceSmith8 I am token agnostic in this case, who ever hosts it wins. All I care about is the RE asset, in this case. Same with cloud computing. Some will win a large slice of the pie but not one will win everything."
14879,2020-11-29 00:52:28+00:00,RaoulGMI,@Andrewstotle @JeffSnider_AIP too extreme...it is defending a kingdom that needs no defense.
14880,2020-11-29 00:51:24+00:00,RaoulGMI,@PriceSmith8 You own dollar and you own Apple stock. Simple.
14881,2020-11-29 00:50:50+00:00,RaoulGMI,@Lynxabi @AlexMorgan1984 I think you are using a BTC framework to understand tokens. Not the same thing.
14882,2020-11-29 00:49:34+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@ZackG1982 @coryklippsten No, that is not what Im doing at all. I own bitcoin because I fundamentally believe in it. I own ETH because I think it has good potential as a platform and that's it. The rest I keep an open mind about but not as a reserve asset. BTC solves that only."
14883,2020-11-29 00:47:38+00:00,RaoulGMI,@AlexMorgan1984 @Lynxabi haven't done any work on it
14884,2020-11-29 00:46:41+00:00,RaoulGMI,@Takeshi_6102 They are not money. Dont confuse them.
14885,2020-11-29 00:46:22+00:00,RaoulGMI,@MMT2Global @JeffBooth Exactly. You and I know how coveted and private that world was...
14886,2020-11-29 00:45:34+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@PriceSmith8 maybe, maybe not depends on the perceived value of that asset but having your base layer of bitcoin makes total sense."
14887,2020-11-29 00:42:37+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@coryklippsten Im not even sure what you are trying to say... but just be open to the fact that digital assets of all types aren't going away and bitcoin is dominant in its space and will remain so, most likely."
14888,2020-11-29 00:41:18+00:00,RaoulGMI,@petenajarian Cheers Pete. Hope all is well.
14889,2020-11-29 00:40:32+00:00,RaoulGMI,@PriceSmith8 Of course I do.
14890,2020-11-29 00:34:45+00:00,RaoulGMI,@ropapope ha! Liz introduced me! I miss her! Have seen her in ages @Liz_Hatch

14893,2020-11-29 00:32:42+00:00,RaoulGMI,@PriceSmith8 Not really. See Arca for details. +300% YTD by truly understanding token values.
14894,2020-11-29 00:30:32+00:00,RaoulGMI,@AlexMorgan1984 @Lynxabi Those are the key reasons and some guys are getting wealthy from it.
14895,2020-11-29 00:30:03+00:00,RaoulGMI,@Crypto_Bastiat @PeterLBrandt @RayDalio I'll accept anything except a Dalio quote. Fraud.
14896,2020-11-29 00:29:28+00:00,RaoulGMI,@HodlMagoo @LatAm_hodl Try google.
14897,2020-11-29 00:28:29+00:00,RaoulGMI,@OptimistLib And that is admirable. Definitely has been plagued by this but there are some real breakthroughs too. Its a feature as opposed to a big but we mist protect people without telling them howe to think by help explain.
14898,2020-11-29 00:22:16+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@MMT2Global @JeffBooth ha! you old dog, you..."
14899,2020-11-29 00:21:12+00:00,RaoulGMI,@LatAm_hodl Spoiler: You cant.
14900,2020-11-29 00:20:43+00:00,RaoulGMI,@OptimistLib Ok. Maybe re-read my tweet about not being told how to think or what to do. ..
14901,2020-11-29 00:20:02+00:00,RaoulGMI,@aintoproudtobeg and it might be one of the best solutions till. There is no perfect.

14904,2020-11-29 00:18:22+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@OptimistLib If you know me by now, you know that is all I do."
14905,2020-11-29 00:17:58+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@PriceSmith8 Many will do very well. Think of them as shares and its easier to get your head around the concept and think of bitcoin as gold. Not the same thing, at all."
14906,2020-11-29 00:16:33+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@MMT2Global @JeffBooth Thanks so much, whoever you are (who clearly knows me!)"
14907,2020-11-29 00:16:05+00:00,RaoulGMI,@mmg9393 Explain why you think I should do that based on my one line tweet?
14908,2020-11-29 00:15:26+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@KryptoSpartan Maybe it can dominate all. But I dont see anything else as a competitor, but a complement product."
14909,2020-11-29 00:14:49+00:00,RaoulGMI,@PeterLBrandt And we are happy to disagree from time to time and still enjoy each others company with respect. This is what we have learned in our lives...
14910,2020-11-29 00:14:05+00:00,RaoulGMI,@E_moonwatcher Exactly!
14911,2020-11-29 00:13:24+00:00,RaoulGMI,@Marksie05 hahaha
14912,2020-11-29 00:13:15+00:00,RaoulGMI,@CountBitcoin Jeez...
14913,2020-11-29 00:13:02+00:00,RaoulGMI,@TorstiNisula It actually is. Proven ownership of your own data is the holy grail if there is one.
14914,2020-11-29 00:12:24+00:00,RaoulGMI,@rfarc9 100%
14915,2020-11-29 00:11:44+00:00,RaoulGMI,@LatAm_hodl You are telling me how to think. Did I say its fully decentralized? Did I say its a competitors to Bitcoin? Did I say anything about it? No. The rest is your assumption.
14916,2020-11-29 00:10:44+00:00,RaoulGMI,@OptimistLib Maybe there is something to learn from studying why it isn't good or what its benefits might be and why others find it interesting...?
14917,2020-11-29 00:09:57+00:00,RaoulGMI,@BittyPolitics haha... I never quite understood these but they made me laugh.
14918,2020-11-29 00:08:32+00:00,RaoulGMI,@_C0WB0Y Thank you kind stranger.
14919,2020-11-29 00:06:40+00:00,RaoulGMI,@PriceSmith8 who said shitcoins are money?  Maybe they are just tokens that have a possible value? Two wildly different things...
14920,2020-11-29 00:05:44+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@Lynxabi Im not sure its that simple. I dont own it. I dont think of it like bitcoin but as a utility token, dunno. Im agnostic right now until I learn more."
14921,2020-11-29 00:04:17+00:00,RaoulGMI,@crypt_oh_no And then lashings of rum to ease the pain...

14944,2020-11-28 23:39:52+00:00,RaoulGMI,@ZackG1982 Brilliant. You completely ignored the context of my thread. Why is it king? Then others can learn...
14945,2020-11-28 23:38:13+00:00,RaoulGMI,"And no one can tell me how to think or what to think. 

Trying to do that is a dangerous mindset.

You can explain why you hold your views and that is powerful and valuable for everyone.

14948,2020-11-28 23:02:46+00:00,RaoulGMI,@drfredch Because they have all made it clear that the dollar is The problem. Question is whether they can get the US across the line... but CBDC's change a lot of that as anyone can create a basket. We can using stable coins too.
14949,2020-11-28 22:45:09+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@drfredch It depends as we have bitcoin and gold as lift rafts, I think most corporations and commodity producers would ,much rather have one currency which includes US and is not denominated in it."
14950,2020-11-28 15:12:16+00:00,RaoulGMI,@darioperkins I agree... a stronger dollar might do it or a larger global private sector insolvency. Dunno. Maybe it doesn’t happen but many are pushing hard..it’s definitely not super high odds.
14951,2020-11-28 15:05:22+00:00,RaoulGMI,@darioperkins Agreed but there will be some ERM-style mechanism most likely. But just having the dollar in the basket is THE game changer as Facebook Libra found out very quickly.
14952,2020-11-28 14:45:04+00:00,RaoulGMI,@darioperkins How about trading bloc style SDR's? China seems to be on that track? The BOE under Carney also wanted it and the ECB seem keen...
14953,2020-11-28 14:34:51+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@HayekAndKeynes Meaning that savings won't flow into bond to drive returns as they look more like cash, so excess savings will find a new home. I think the pension system and insurance system underwrites bonds and the CB's do the rest."
14954,2020-11-28 14:33:38+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@PriapusIQ No, I think they will try to do anything to hold a status quo, regardless of how bad the trade offs, they will perceive them as worth it because it protects them."
14955,2020-11-28 14:30:42+00:00,RaoulGMI,@HayekAndKeynes Im not sure we are disagreeing. I see no problems for bonds.
14956,2020-11-28 14:29:31+00:00,RaoulGMI,@iBobbyShell Thanks my friend.
14957,2020-11-28 14:29:07+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@PriapusIQ Yup, but they will try and it might last 10 years... the EU has lasted thus far."
14958,2020-11-28 14:19:10+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@Michael11657386 @HayekAndKeynes Yes, but if the dollar weight in a new basket is lower and EM's can use the new basket currency, that gives them a HUGE advantage."
14959,2020-11-28 14:18:34+00:00,RaoulGMI,@HayekAndKeynes Agreed. The private pension system is much more weighted to equities still and that will change over time.

14961,2020-11-28 14:08:09+00:00,RaoulGMI,@std_dev @enlundm I dont think you are wrong but I think there are possible more precise mechanisms...not sure what they are yet.
14962,2020-11-28 14:01:29+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@std_dev @enlundm With an aging population, a huge part will get saved and velocity will likely continue to fall, Japan tried this kinds of things... didnt work."
14963,2020-11-28 13:59:07+00:00,RaoulGMI,@NICKRADICAL4 @enlundm Very true but I do think COVID will change education costs forever as everyone scales Saas education models and it will be hugely deflationary...
14964,2020-11-28 13:53:49+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@HayekAndKeynes Agreed. Its the death of old school macro. New skills needed for many and also majority of worlds capital needs to find a new home, really."
14965,2020-11-28 13:47:49+00:00,RaoulGMI,@enlundm @NICKRADICAL4 Im not sure how different it is to a tax cut on cap gains. Anyone who paid cap gains at a higher rate before feels its regressive. No way around it.

15061,2020-11-28 01:03:16+00:00,RaoulGMI,@FreedomGeoFin @johndandrea Kind of what Im saying...
15062,2020-11-28 01:02:44+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@VolumeDynamics That is not what Im saying. One off deal and then monetary discipline. During the deval the CB's buy the bonds, obviously and all fiat currency together devals, hence not bagger thy neighbor."
15063,2020-11-28 01:01:37+00:00,RaoulGMI,@KleegerAndrew Yes but the IMF are clearly telling us otherwise. I agree that this is one option that has a probability too.

15075,2020-11-28 00:39:34+00:00,RaoulGMI,@KleegerAndrew its much the same thing but the rest of the world has made it clear that this dollar system is unsustainable. US is 25% of world GDP and 80% of all transactions.
15076,2020-11-28 00:37:56+00:00,RaoulGMI,@SuperCycleBear Yup. Nicely put and that is my point really... a new regime shift is likely.

15083,2020-11-28 00:32:06+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@MonetaryWonk Im talking a massive one off global fiat deval, which is obviously a huge debt reduction via inflation."
15084,2020-11-28 00:31:12+00:00,RaoulGMI,@rayvasson @DavidJNage @RealVision Thanks!
15085,2020-11-28 00:31:00+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@tomkaradza @jyashouafar maybe. But it depends at what price, it cant be infinity if money supply is fixed at 2% growth."
15086,2020-11-28 00:29:55+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@RonanBroadhead @Darky999 No, not a all. There is no speculation in the basket CBDC as the USD is part of it so its denominator is money supply, which is fixed at 2% growth, for example (again, just an idea)."
15087,2020-11-28 00:28:25+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@jyashouafar Yes, but what happens in money supply globally ends up being fixed for a decade at 2%? Obviously, that would happen after the big devaluation of Fiat..."
15088,2020-11-28 00:27:29+00:00,RaoulGMI,@__observer_ Im not sure. Its having the dollar in the basket at a fixed weight that is a huge difference. The dollar is usually a denominator but in this case M2 would be... not sure if that makes a difference.
15089,2020-11-28 00:26:32+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@MonetaryWonk But equities are so hugely valued. and if money supply stops growing after the initial +35% shock, do they continue?"
15090,2020-11-28 00:24:14+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@bstofka My thought is a basket of fiat but with the dollar in it and not as the denominator, just like the initial Libra idea. And then a restricted money supply..."
15091,2020-11-28 00:19:27+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@Darky999 Or at least a new game that is different, which is kind of exciting too but new skills to learn."
15092,2020-11-28 00:18:25+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@geswolfcrest Yes, Im looking past that. I take that for granted... its after that where it really matters."
15093,2020-11-28 00:17:59+00:00,RaoulGMI,@74gj79 It has happened from time to time... Bretton Woods and leaving Bretton Wood were two shocks of this sort.
15094,2020-11-28 00:15:55+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@DavidBCollum @chigrl Thanks Dave. 2x overvalued in equities or what market? I kind of think equities just becomes cyclical in that development of rates at zero forever, after the initial BS rise."
15095,2020-11-28 00:14:46+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Where does the worlds capital flow? Is it fixed asset investment such as technology, clean energy, AI, robotics? Does that accelerate good or bad trends? Capital will find a home somewhere..."
15096,2020-11-28 00:13:30+00:00,RaoulGMI,@rwhs99 Its a lot bigger than that. Where does capital find a home?
15097,2020-11-28 00:13:07+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@DavidBCollum @chigrl Yes, I tend to agree. It kind of played out that way in Japan. But maybe $$$ flows in to fixed asset investment such as tech. robotics, AI, etc that eventually has a pay off (both good and bad)."
15098,2020-11-28 00:11:55+00:00,RaoulGMI,@Alexey_Shumarin @chigrl Dont be a dick.
15099,2020-11-28 00:10:44+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@Darky999 No, I think there are 3 to 4 years of MASSIVE macro and then none."
15100,2020-11-28 00:10:17+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@dailydirtnap For a while, for sure.... Im looking out 3 to 4 years. Japan has had zero bond moves, zero currency moves and zero credit moves in decades..."
15101,2020-11-28 00:07:26+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@chigrl Agreed. Im looking forwards three or four years out... Basically Japan. No FX moves, no yield moves, no credit moves."
15102,2020-11-28 00:06:39+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@AnteMarkic @edwardnh Yes, another short sharp supply shock fear but in the end no biggie. Much like the KYC stuff. short term fears."
15103,2020-11-28 00:05:25+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@JasonFielding And EU and Japan and Canada, Australia, and maybe India and Brazil?"
15104,2020-11-28 00:04:18+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Not easy to know but interesting to think about.

A world of no bond investing, no FX, constrained money supply growth. It is possible. Maybe inflation runs hot, maybe technology deflation helps?"
15105,2020-11-28 00:04:18+00:00,RaoulGMI,"I dont know, but I think that the probability of all of this coming is not inconsiderable.

How are equities prices in that? Do we just move to a digital world instead, where the alpha lies in tokenized securities? How does real estate work?"
15106,2020-11-28 00:04:18+00:00,RaoulGMI,"So, where does that leave macro? Even gold and bitcoin become oddly less positive once the big event is done. 

Does that just leave equities? Is there inflation after the big event? Maybe they are on larger M2 growth per annum?"
15107,2020-11-28 00:01:05+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Basically, there is a huge trade to be had from the re-adjustment and then FX dies a death.

At this point there is no bond market and no FX market. The two largest on Earth. Corp credit is probably backstopped too."
15108,2020-11-28 00:01:04+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Then I think that for that basket to work, if it includes the US dollar, the denominator will be global money supply, so after the big print, maybe the cap it for all members at 2% per annum, or whatever."
15109,2020-11-28 00:01:04+00:00,RaoulGMI,"They also have talked about getting everyone to monetize debt in a ""once off"" event for COVID, so maybe they agree a 30% to 40% money supply increase for all (currency neutral but obis bullish gold and bitcoin). Essentially a jubilee of sorts."
15110,2020-11-28 00:01:04+00:00,RaoulGMI,"The IMF and the CB's are talking about CBDC's and a new Bretton Woods. That is likely to be something around the original Libra idea of a world currency/currencies, based on a basket that includes the USD."
15111,2020-11-28 00:01:04+00:00,RaoulGMI,"My view (right or wrong) is that rates aren't going up and are pinned at zero or negative for a long, long time. So, there is going to be no bond trading (see Japan and EU). The biggest trade in macro ever is nearly over."

15425,2020-11-22 21:35:47+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@S_Mikhailovich @coloradotravis Agreed. But there again, fierce protection of the networks benefits by participants is how you drive the network effect. Gold did that millennia ago, when it became accepted as money."

However, the bigger Q is - what is a perpetual negative coupon bond worth if it is accepted as perfect collateral/money. Zero or infinity - can be both but depends on your need for it."

17029,2020-09-29 14:26:56+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Lots and lots more to come in the next 3 months... 

Vive la Revolucion!"
17030,2020-09-29 14:26:55+00:00,RaoulGMI,"The financial community ecosystem is being reinvented and it's being driven by our members who are encouraging us to push even more boundaries...

Crypto, education, massive platform features, new forms of engagement and more connections and more access."
17031,2020-09-29 14:26:55+00:00,RaoulGMI,"That revolution is giving the power of knowledge to all.

And this revolution is just about to pick up pace....

Watch this space."
17032,2020-09-29 14:26:54+00:00,RaoulGMI,"There is so much great content out there that many of you make too. Its not exclusive but inclusive. We are all part of this bigger community.

The stronger the community that forms, the bigger the revolution it can create."
17033,2020-09-29 14:26:54+00:00,RaoulGMI,"From neuroscientists to astrophysicists, from hedge fund managers to filmmakers, from cab drivers to students...

And they all want to help each other, learn from each other and learn from all the content on RV and elsewhere."
17034,2020-09-29 14:26:54+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Our members made nearly 200 videos to help other members and newbies!!

17036,2020-09-29 14:26:53+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Now our members, our RV team, our interviewers, our interviewees and our research providers all mix and SHARE ideas.

Disruption is about challenging EVERYTHING to create a new, magical and valuable experience for your members.

New media is ALL about your members."
17038,2020-09-29 14:26:52+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Natural, irreverent, intellectual, authentic content is still rare in media.

But in this world, it should be ALL about the content of all types, the learning journey for everyone. And we actively encourage different people to take us on those journeys."
17039,2020-09-29 14:26:52+00:00,RaoulGMI,"But the big piece of Real Vision magic is that we do peer-to-peer interviews. They pretty much don't exist elsewhere in the media. It's deemed threatening to the star ""hosts"" or the founders, and is not ""controllable.""

That's the point!"
17040,2020-09-29 14:26:51+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Yes, we have our own talented interviewers, most aren't camera trained, or fit any definition of ""presenters"". 

They are all authentic and they are all smart and inquisitive. What you see is what you get...real people with a passion for RV."
17041,2020-09-29 14:26:51+00:00,RaoulGMI,"A smart, engaging, funny, intellectual, authentic conversation where everyone goes down the deep learning journey with Hugh.

This is a million miles from what anyone else is doing in financial media."

17810,2020-08-29 11:31:30+00:00,RaoulGMI,@JulietteJDI Anything less than 13.5% alcohol won’t give you a bad hangover. Tested robustly by me over the last couple of decades. Hence why Champagne tends to work nicely as you can’t make it over 12.5%.

17832,2020-08-29 02:49:44+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Second to those are la Rioja Alta a 904 and 890 Gran Reserva's

And after that, any Rioja Reserva or GR, pre 1995."
17833,2020-08-29 02:49:44+00:00,RaoulGMI,** Addendum - just to be clear - the greatest undervalued wines of all time are the 30 yr + Gran Reserva Viña Tondonia's and Bosconia's of Lopez de Heredia. Some of the best wines of earth for a 1/10th of the cost of anything close to equivalent.

If you aren't in the market for expensive wines then drink Vina Tondonia, Vina Real, Ardanza and 904 Reserva's for $30 to $60."

17870,2020-08-29 01:05:55+00:00,RaoulGMI,"The 1947 Viña Tondonia is still incredible drinking well ( I haven't tried it) and costs $1000!!! That is less than 2010 Screaming Eagle. 

A 1945 DRC from Burgundy (really rather similar in style) sold two years ago for $550,000."
17871,2020-08-29 01:05:55+00:00,RaoulGMI,"At the shop at the bodega, they sell red wines back to the 1930's, whites to the 1950's and rose's to the early 1980's. WTF!!!

Their wines literally live forever and hold their fruit and unctuous elegance and fine oak."
17872,2020-08-29 01:05:54+00:00,RaoulGMI,"They ignore all new rules, use American oak barrels (not steel or French oak). Specially season them. Then they store them longer in oak than anyone and then in the bottle longer. and then they leave them for a reaaaally long time."
17873,2020-08-29 01:05:54+00:00,RaoulGMI,"But I save the best for last, the oldest of the old school. The most stubborn winemakers in the world - Lopez de Heredia, who make things the very, very old fashioned way, even carrying grapes on their backs in baskets not on tractors."
17874,2020-08-29 01:05:54+00:00,RaoulGMI,"These are ridiculous value for those of you used to drinking wines at that price. Nothing remotely comes close. 

Nothing.

You can buy good Rioja's for $25 to $35. 

Parker doesn't like them. Good."
17875,2020-08-29 01:05:53+00:00,RaoulGMI,"You can buy younger versions and Reserva's for less than $50. It's ludicrous in a world of $1500 4 year old Screaming Eagle or even Opus One.

Tonight Im going to drink 2005 La Rioja Alta 904 Gran Reserva. Cost me about $70."
17876,2020-08-29 01:05:53+00:00,RaoulGMI,"It's like the finest burgundy - pure elegance and deliciousness. Light yet deep. but it cost 1/10th of the cost of an equivalent aged great burgundy.

1/10th! (around $300 vs $3,000+)."
17877,2020-08-29 01:05:53+00:00,RaoulGMI,"These wines live for ever. I kid you not. On Tuesday night I drank a 1964 La Rioja Alta Gran Reserva. It was pure silk, strawberries and red currents but with subtle oak and still had the backbone of tannin. 

Un-fucking-believable."
17878,2020-08-29 01:04:10+00:00,RaoulGMI,"In order not to take up your whole evening (you've got wine to drink!), I'm going to give you a quick link to La Rioja Alta - Truly fucking incredible wines. I can not recommend enough. 

https://t.co/aU21NHKa8u"
17879,2020-08-29 01:04:10+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Some like Castillio Ygay and Imperial have partially Parkerised and are now 14% (such a shame) but others like La Rioja Alta and Lopez de Heredia didn't.

These wines are the most underpriced fine wines in the world."
17880,2020-08-29 01:04:10+00:00,RaoulGMI,"But some old bodegas didn't change. They held their ground that was true to Rioja. 

Wines that are IMMORTAL.

Wines that drink well over 50 years old (or after a few years if its a Crianza).

Wines that are fine, elegant and unique."
17881,2020-08-29 01:04:09+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Great wines, but they had lost that Rioja magic. 

They had globalized around the Parker scoring system in order to sell more wine at much higher prices into the US. Dark, jammy, strong and younger, much younger."
17882,2020-08-29 01:04:09+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Old makers like Marques de Riscal and Marques the Murrieta changed how they made wines. Alcohol went up from 12.5% to 14% or 14.5%.

New bodegas popped up with 15% wines like Roda and their HUGE Cirsion and Roda I."
17883,2020-08-29 01:04:09+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Now, here's the rub. Parker didn't like the wines of Rioja. He didn't like their oak, lower alcohol or fine elegance like a good old-school burgundy. 

That forced many Bodegas to change how they made wines..."
17884,2020-08-29 00:56:43+00:00,RaoulGMI,"With the very best wines coming from the region of La Rioja Alta and often around the town of Haro, where the famous bodegas are usually based.

More to come! I've hit the thread limit. if you are still with me, the big reveal lies ahead.."

17888,2020-08-29 00:56:41+00:00,RaoulGMI,"But not everyone changed...

Before I get to that, time to take a sip of my pre-dinner cocktail while my wine breathes.

The ""RP Lockdown"" is a Campari and Orange La Croix in a tall glass over ice with a slice of orange. :-)"
17889,2020-08-29 00:56:41+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Out was elegance (wines between 12% and 13%), out went wines that develop over time with beauty and fragility. Out went the subtle charms of regions, soil, oak barrels, micro climates. 

Parker and the industry didn't want the old ways."
17890,2020-08-29 00:56:41+00:00,RaoulGMI,"High alcohol (14%+) and micro bubbles etc hid the tannins, meaning wine didn't need to age as much to drink. 

Gone for the need for 20 years of stock! Gone was some of the harvest weather risk! Gone aging risk! Win/win."
17891,2020-08-29 00:56:41+00:00,RaoulGMI,"And the public couldn't get enough - a scoring system that rated buying wines like buying fridges! And the intense alcohol gave sweetness to the wines, making them more akin to the over-flavored processed food with sugar AND salt to build false flavor profile. MORE!"
17892,2020-08-29 00:56:40+00:00,RaoulGMI,"But in the incredible film Mondo Vino, which tells this sad story of the globalization of the wine palette on his points system, the real villains were the consultants like Michel Rolland who persuaded winemakers to change.

17895,2020-08-29 00:56:39+00:00,RaoulGMI,"And the world of wine began to get distorted by these super big, high alcohol wines that were stripped of terroir and were over fruited on over ripened vines.

You see, no one had a choice not to change their wines."
17896,2020-08-29 00:56:39+00:00,RaoulGMI,The US became the biggest market in the world as Parker had made it easy to understand wine. But his palette changed wines forever and wines became standardized to it in order to get the famous high 90's scores so they sold well for big $$$
17897,2020-08-29 00:56:39+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Those wines, being rather warm wines have higher alcohol of around 13.5% to 14% back in the 80's (now 14.5% to 15.5%!)

Parker also didn't believe in terroir (wines that taste of where they are made), he believed in grape variety above all."
17898,2020-08-29 00:56:38+00:00,RaoulGMI,"But the law of unintended consequences kicked in... 

Parker became very famous and the world hung on his points system and his palette. But his palette is subjective and he liked what he liked. BIG wines of Napa were his reference."
17899,2020-08-29 00:56:38+00:00,RaoulGMI,"He developed a 100 point scoring system for wines to reduce the uncertainty and fear for regular people who didn't know how to get over the knowledge fear that the snobby world of wines had created.

Genius."
17900,2020-08-29 00:56:38+00:00,RaoulGMI,"He nailed it. It became one of the best vintages ever, and no one else saw its potential on initial tastings. 

His reputation was set.

Parker, an American, then opened up the world of wines for the US market with a simple trick..."

17959,2020-08-26 21:24:07+00:00,RaoulGMI,@coloradotravis @SteveGreaves9 @RealVision The Fed has set rates too low and is one of the reasons that low rates tends to be deflationary as marginal propensity to lend goes down. Hence why self issued debt rose.
17960,2020-08-26 21:22:53+00:00,RaoulGMI,@coloradotravis @SteveGreaves9 @RealVision Incredible thread again. One question would be the marginal propensity to lend if reserves are plentiful and are signalled by Fed to be so. The hoarding of reserves is a function of perceived risk plus regulation. It maybe suggests rates are too low for risks of lending I.e.

It also works for pandemics."
18676,2020-06-21 01:16:14+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Or maybe enough people aren't seduced by your silky copy and viral video marketing and skip it (getting the R0 below 1 by cautious preventative measure, where is fizzles out).

Most campaigns suffer this over time. 

See, its not about politics, its just the numbers game."
18677,2020-06-21 01:16:13+00:00,RaoulGMI,"The TAM is what makes Facebook, Google and What'sApp so huge. It's tough the saturate.

It's what stops fad products like Beany Babies. The TAM gets saturated."
18678,2020-06-21 01:16:13+00:00,RaoulGMI,"If people use ad blockers, that lowers your probability of success in the campaign (masks and social distance).

After a while, either growth collapses because all your target market (Total Addressable Market) is saturated (Herd imm.). Pretty difficult as TAM is so big for COVID."
18679,2020-06-21 01:16:13+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Yes, new treatments to alleviate symptoms can tweak the funnel conversion rates but the top of funnel numbers trump all other elements. Everything else is optimizing a campaign.

If Facebook and Google ban your campaign, it stops. That is a vaccine or a lock down."
18680,2020-06-21 01:16:13+00:00,RaoulGMI,"If COVID were a SaaS business, using a performance marketing campaign, this would be one of the best I've seen.

It's pure funnel maths since the top of funnel is growing so fast and the conversion rates all the way down are also growing."
18681,2020-06-21 01:16:12+00:00,RaoulGMI,"The final part of the sales campaign is the ""price is going up"". Once occupancy of ICU and Surge begin to fill, excess deaths rise. These are the people who pay the full, post-offer price. They come later, but you can project out those sales from here (deaths WoW are rising 20%). https://t.co/xh9y3PLPIZ"
18682,2020-06-21 01:16:12+00:00,RaoulGMI,"And offer anyone who declined a ""last chance offer"" to mop up the funnel for the optimal conversion. Surge capacity is starting to get used. Get in quick! https://t.co/hCBU6BQCEc"
18683,2020-06-21 01:16:12+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Then add in the ""limited number"" FOMO hook. Normal ICU beds are nearly full. It always works to attract the undecided. https://t.co/6cjfRy780y"
18684,2020-06-21 01:16:11+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Now you've got your funnel working and traffic is converting all the way down, its now time to get a new customer. Best thing is to offer a special deal. How about a nice ICU bed? 20% of all ICU beds are now COVID patients in Houston. https://t.co/4VkN9WrIqQ"
18685,2020-06-21 01:16:11+00:00,RaoulGMI,"But we all know, that the real battle lies in getting a good conversion rate to trial. The higher the conversion to trial, the better the results. The virus is doing well in its Houston campaign. Hospital bed usage by COVID is rising very sharply... https://t.co/AC4d0DaoXH"
18686,2020-06-21 01:16:10+00:00,RaoulGMI,"The next part of our sales funnel would be to get someone to your landing page or home page. That is when you get to interact. The more people that get there, the higher probability of success. In this case, the number of hospitalizations are increasing massively. https://t.co/Gmh77xsZ15"
18687,2020-06-21 01:16:10+00:00,RaoulGMI,But the conversion to the next part of the funnel is highly effective. Sales are outperforming the marketing spend. Positive tests as a % are rising. Your sales funnel is becoming more effective and is a HUGE positive for any Saas business. This means you are getting + returns.
18688,2020-06-21 01:16:10+00:00,RaoulGMI,"The exact same is true in COVID.

Houston is the best example of the second wave problems of re-opening before the R0 was below 1 (where infection rates dwindle such as NYC).

The sales funnel - paid marketing is consistent and high. Here we can see tests are high but stable. https://t.co/I5gxDPOzOl"
18689,2020-06-21 01:16:10+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Take your politics out of COVID 19 and instead think of cases&gt;hospitalizations&gt;beds&gt;ICU&gt;Deaths. 

It's essentially the exact same metrics as a sales or marketing funnel.

Total traffic is the largest driver and after that it's the conversion rates of the other parts of the funnel"

You see, with rates at zero, rising real rates bring two reaction functions from the central banks - negative rates or more printing. Both are very bullish gold."

18888,2020-06-09 11:32:04+00:00,RaoulGMI,@DivergentVentur I think its bullish gold because the only answer from the Fed for rising real rates is more printing as they are at zero bound and will drag their feet. But more printing or negative rates are both very bullish gold.

Let's see. It is a concern, especially in the US.

Again, to re-iterate, Im not interested in the politics or death rates being worth it, just economic effects."
18972,2020-06-04 12:38:50+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Also, the fact that we are still hitting new highs in the virus in many big EM countries too, means that global travel will continue to be effectively shut for the next 6 months.

This potential for a second wave is just one of the key risks going into H2, globally."
18973,2020-06-04 12:38:49+00:00,RaoulGMI,"And our job is not to debate death rates or whatever, but population behavior and government responses and a growing virus increases the chances of lower growth due to the marginal effect on behavior and even the risk of secondary shut downs."
18974,2020-06-04 12:38:49+00:00,RaoulGMI,"And that does lead to a high risk of a second wave. Remember, second waves are not necessarily about weather but whether the R0 was held below 1. If it wasn't, then the multiplier effect takes hold and much larger numbers get affected, generally exponentially."
18975,2020-06-04 12:38:48+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Now, Im not interested in the political debate of whether it is worth the re-opening or not. That is just the fast route to a Twitter shit fight. But the US is re-opening at peak virus (not peak growth) outside of NYC and New Jersey and has mass gatherings. https://t.co/GfuX99XPAC"

20302,2020-03-18 17:35:21+00:00,RaoulGMI,"And the way it is going to play out is via dollar strength, not weakness. I do not see any mechanism to stop this. Oil falling to $22 in a couple of week is a shock that the global funding markets can not take.

There are simply not enough dollars being generated as the world"
20303,2020-03-18 17:35:21+00:00,RaoulGMI,"The net result is going to be a scramble for dollars unseen in our lifetimes. The 1930's was the last time we saw this as money poured into the US, forcing an eventual devaluation vs gold.

This time the very dollar system is at risk, as I have always said."

20680,2020-03-08 12:34:24+00:00,RaoulGMI,@GregVous I think the credit markets will seize up first. There is no demand for oil in a world shutting down so it helps no one for a long while yet.
20681,2020-03-08 12:33:24+00:00,RaoulGMI,@amingopalani Agreed. But there are too many cross currents right now. We will get a fantastic opportunity to buy India in the next 12 months...

20687,2020-03-08 11:31:06+00:00,RaoulGMI,@Darky999 @lakshmishaks Exactly. Max pain.

20689,2020-03-08 11:24:35+00:00,RaoulGMI,If Russia wanted to inflict max pain on the US it would be via an oil price collapse. The credit markets are going to find this very hard to deal with as liquidity has already dried up. Trump probably thanked Putin from the American consumer without realising the damage caused...

20711,2020-03-06 02:39:28+00:00,RaoulGMI,@naufalsanaullah Cool. Thanks. Did I sent you the latest GMI?
20712,2020-03-06 02:38:06+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@naufalsanaullah Always possible, as it a rolling global shutdown on the virus which is too much for China to offset 9 months of last demand. I really worry about the next few weeks. Beyond that I don't know."

20715,2020-03-06 02:25:35+00:00,RaoulGMI,@Cessnadriver50 me too. Very worried.
20716,2020-03-06 02:22:49+00:00,RaoulGMI,@Laurenttrader Watch my piece tomorrow on RV... its probably more than a recession..
20717,2020-03-06 02:19:04+00:00,RaoulGMI,I am very worried about the next 6 weeks in equities. Extremely worried indeed. As just an example the Nikkei is right on the biggest supports of the decade. https://t.co/iw2gHRsBmM
20718,2020-03-05 15:12:49+00:00,RaoulGMI,@BurggrabenH Two different things. ED is the price of 3 month interest rates on maturity. A five year note is the interest that you would be paid today for 5 years. There is a forward market that allows you to speculate on 5 year rates in 5 years time

20720,2020-03-05 14:29:34+00:00,RaoulGMI,@alexandrascaggs This is a really important point. I was mulling this too. Maybe they don’t test and don’t quarantine and accept illness and increased deaths instead.

20727,2020-03-04 19:59:25+00:00,RaoulGMI,@naufalsanaullah The only real question is when do they start actually testing and then it will take a couple of weeks past that for the real situation to be realised.
20728,2020-03-04 19:49:31+00:00,RaoulGMI,@amingopalani Soon. Next week and week after will be big inflection points. They will cancel Glastonbury too

The actions will all be rational, but the outcomes of those actions risk an outsized economic effect."

The knock-on effects are now spreading slowly into the currency markets. That is where I think where the next phase lies...

21523,2020-01-31 11:35:30+00:00,RaoulGMI,"But I think this game we all slave over, is about not trading just the immediate narrative - ""growth lower = rates lower"", but trading the potential knock-on effects, where you have to go further out on the macro risk curve to get ahead of the market."
21524,2020-01-31 11:35:30+00:00,RaoulGMI,"The bond market, already rallying on weakness saw the light immediately and 2-year yields collapsed, breaking key supports and a new cyclical low.

Fear takes over (rightly or wrong, I just don't know. None of us do). Is this a bigger demand shock than the Gulf Wars and probably 9/11? All came at times of weakness."
21526,2020-01-31 11:35:28+00:00,RaoulGMI,"My focus here isn't on the virus but the overwhelming reaction by states. Air travel to, and within, China has collapsed.

21527,2020-01-31 11:35:28+00:00,RaoulGMI,"So any demand shock or change in investor risk preference was going to lead to a profound change in markets.

21531,2020-01-31 11:35:24+00:00,RaoulGMI,"That led me to remain long of bonds and add last week. But by Sunday night, Asian open, I realised it was time to go aggressively full-risk in fixed income. To my mind the tipping point had arrived that was so pervasive that it was going to overwhelm everything for a few months."
21532,2020-01-31 11:35:24+00:00,RaoulGMI,"Global growth was already weak and the reflation noise of Q4 was beginning to fade, giving more credence to my underlying view of sustained global economic weakness.

21681,2020-01-26 14:01:29+00:00,RaoulGMI,@azplaced Because someone is going to go bust...
21682,2020-01-26 14:00:38+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@hidflect Yes, agreed. Liquidity will go to zero and prices will move too much, hence asymmetric risk in buying put structures."
21683,2020-01-26 14:00:02+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@roberteross_ 100% agree. that has been on my radar for a long time. Clearly, GE and the bond holders will fight that with the ratings agencies (its pretty corrupt)."

21694,2020-01-26 13:52:36+00:00,RaoulGMI,@joebet68 I was looking at HYG 1 x 4 put spreads.
21695,2020-01-26 13:52:17+00:00,RaoulGMI,@tdarling1 Agree.

21697,2020-01-26 13:50:54+00:00,RaoulGMI,@TIGcapital Exactly...hence the cascade from BBB all the way down to CCC... everything will get hit.
21698,2020-01-26 13:50:30+00:00,RaoulGMI,@alihobbalah Ha! v interesting. You need to spread them vs duration matched treasuries to isolate the credit risk.
21699,2020-01-26 13:49:01+00:00,RaoulGMI,@zhanginu TLB? But agree... BBB's are insanely tight versus other parts of the credit spectrum. It is the most overvalued in history with ludicrous low default rates priced in.
21700,2020-01-26 13:46:25+00:00,RaoulGMI,@DavidSkarica Agreed.

Here is the bear steepening that started off the main steepening trend that went into the 2008 recession. Is it a guarantee? Nope. But worth noting... https://t.co/cNRJNwciEo

22396,2019-11-19 01:08:36+00:00,RaoulGMI,Yup. Absolutely correct
22397,2019-11-19 01:01:29+00:00,RaoulGMI,@ScottSanders5 Literally none of these people do that except maybe one

22399,2019-11-19 00:47:49+00:00,RaoulGMI,@DavidSchawel Obviously I won’t name names as I don’t think it’s becoming to do so

22401,2019-11-19 00:43:34+00:00,RaoulGMI,@DavidSchawel For sure. Without question. The importance is what is their or your time horizon. That is crucial. Also my tweet wasn’t again you but a more general comment about JPM and others playing this kind of game of hubris ...
22402,2019-11-19 00:41:32+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@DavidSchawel Yes, but it’s much more complex than that really. Everyone is wrong frequently. If I went through JPM’s views they would look like fools frequently but what’s the point. They do their best work as do most on the list."
22403,2019-11-19 00:36:30+00:00,RaoulGMI,@DavidSchawel I know many personally. Janjuah is smart as hell and makes money over the cycle. Albert knows the risk he is running and the ridicule for his long term correct macro view. Hussman understands too his tone horizon and the “commentators”. Soros needs no note. ECRI are unbiased etc

Basically, when the YC steepens, they begin to lose confidence but by the 2nd or 3rd rate cut, confidence is only a shade off the highs.

23285,2019-09-16 01:57:36+00:00,RaoulGMI,@RudyHavenstein @fleckcap I think the only way to potential have a no inflation society is 1) Bitcoin or similar (Gold doesn't work as inflation occurs in gold standard too but BTC is deflationary) 2) zero population growth.

When matured, yields were 1% so just re-invested, drew down more capital to make short fall, spent 50% less to live."

23486,2019-09-01 00:00:53+00:00,RaoulGMI,@hks55 Why? You would have said that at 0% too. It depends what is happening to prices overall and to the price of other assets too
23487,2019-09-01 00:00:06+00:00,RaoulGMI,@ruslansv No. it's a sign of demand - i.e. inflation in the price of bonds and thus other prices are expected to fall faster.
23488,2019-08-31 23:57:51+00:00,RaoulGMI,@CristobalCBM Just something different. Mark Carney highlighted it and its something Ive thought about and talked about. We can't tell yet but there are clues..

23586,2019-08-21 09:16:24+00:00,RaoulGMI,@RobinWigg @GauravSaroliya @CNBCJou I remember the mortgage convexity issues very clearly in 2008. They were huge driver of speed of rate changes and same in 2001. Dunno if it’s more or less now but it makes good hunting for bond traders looking for quick sharp moves.

Joe, As you know I am a big fan of your work, although I am not a fan of the condescending snark, which I find unnecessary. In response to your tweet about my observations, I'd like to set the journalistic record somewhat straight... so I wrote you a note... https://t.co/HKNRybYL50"
23854,2019-08-11 11:49:39+00:00,RaoulGMI,@Cryptanonymous1 @Trinhnomics I lived on the Costa Blanca for 10 years - just outside Javea. I am even more home sick for Spain...
23855,2019-08-11 11:37:08+00:00,RaoulGMI,@Trinhnomics Of course... Ive never met an English lawyer who didnt love Cayman. They are extremely well paid here (tax free) and work for great firms and live on the beach and raise kids in paradise..

23860,2019-08-10 20:13:03+00:00,RaoulGMI,@nglinsman @realvision Thanks. I respect your opinions and am too just debating ideas as none of us knows the outcome
23861,2019-08-10 19:54:41+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@albertedwards99 @barronsonline As soon as you are back from Le Continent, you are coming back to @realvision ...!"
23862,2019-08-10 19:50:46+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@nglinsman Question - does the collapse or not matter or is the near enough collapse important enough to freeze the capital markets considering the business cycle is negative? It is the economic outcomes I really concern myself with, not the semantics of technical collapse vs zero price."
23863,2019-08-10 19:44:59+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@nglinsman Now, that doesn’t mean 2008, but it means something very important"
23864,2019-08-10 19:44:37+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@nglinsman Shareholder capital is going to zero. How do you stop a bank run with -2% rates and shares at zero?  It easy, hence it can easily become a solvency issue. Also, there isn’t enough equity availability to fund the gaps. I doubly the maths works"
23865,2019-08-10 19:39:47+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@nglinsman Im also worried about the Japanese banks... similar problem. Oh, and the Japanese yield curve is about to invert.. first time since 1990.."
23866,2019-08-10 19:36:21+00:00,RaoulGMI,@nglinsman I hope that works Nick. But the charts tell me it wont. I am worried that tiered rates might help the banks with the ECB but the real funding markets will go more negative and profit issues will become solvency issues. A positive yield curve with the ECB is not the panacea
23867,2019-08-10 19:32:17+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@0rangeCru5h 10%, well, thats entirely saved the world. Well done you."

23880,2019-08-10 17:11:15+00:00,RaoulGMI,@allstarcharts Yeah...actually concerning.... especially outside US equity index land..
23881,2019-08-10 17:09:19+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@capatli could be too but the chart is much much healthier. Generally, it is a very conservative bank with a well run treasury function."
23882,2019-08-10 17:07:29+00:00,RaoulGMI,@Shagamanx1 This is the bulls argument and I get it. I am concerned that the leverage to equity ratio will begin to severely impair the banks as rates go to -2% in Europe.

But they are the biggest buyers of shares and they may stop buying and that can dramatically alter the market structure.

24217,2019-08-01 11:34:22+00:00,RaoulGMI,Bitcoin is part of this whole macro equation for me and is ready to soon start completing the wedge pattern for the next break higher... this is a good point to accumulate more. https://t.co/LE9YCk7496
24218,2019-08-01 11:34:21+00:00,RaoulGMI,But Gold will probably correct for a good while now (the dollar is too strong for golf in $ terms to go up)... and re-test the break out. But gold is outperforming almost every other currency in the world right now. https://t.co/jyvkohSlcE

24224,2019-08-01 11:34:11+00:00,RaoulGMI,And that would be consistent with commodity prices deflating from the demand shock and the dollar translation effects.

24225,2019-08-01 11:34:09+00:00,RaoulGMI,The most likely knock on effect is the break of 7 in the RMB (which will be falling in line with RoW FX markets vs dollars - remember the RMB is a basket) https://t.co/BNYp1rSP4X

25312,2019-05-13 10:03:29+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@chigrl I thought the last point was crucial. Any firm caught up in this, be it Chinese or American, will be forced now to take action in changing supply chains because policy is being changed too fast to react effectively to.

25313,2019-05-12 23:03:40+00:00,RaoulGMI,@AMKcm @MilwaukeeBonds Interesting. Hadn’t heard that before. What is the mechanism? Have we sufficient data to show a significant funding position? Still feels like EU banks still fund in US$ in the main part for global lending and that won’t allow for the smile to apply. Thoughts ?
25314,2019-05-12 21:21:11+00:00,RaoulGMI,"@MarketInterest It’s the long dates forwards that trade such a long way below spot in dollars. This has rarely ever happened and with near record low vols across the term, it means that the entire thing is ultra attractive even if the dollar fails to rally"

If you normalize the curve for ultra low rates my work suggests that 75bps = 0bps ( roughly) and the curve is probably suggesting a deep inversion already. This is consistent with Japan and Europe.

25884,2019-01-27 15:49:48+00:00,RaoulGMI,@teasri And it’s consistent with my GMI Hard data relationship with SPX YOY and ISM too

25886,2019-01-27 15:48:50+00:00,RaoulGMI,@cem_cfa Many people got false signals in 2012... growth went below zero but only for a quarter.   Nothing is infallible except hindsight

25888,2019-01-27 14:29:33+00:00,RaoulGMI,"And it does a great job with the the SPX YoY - no lead or lag, however. The SPX is correctly pricing in current economic activity. The ECRI suggests growth is close to zero currently. https://t.co/bH3nS7D6ZW"

25890,2019-01-27 14:29:32+00:00,RaoulGMI,You may find this interesting from this months GMI. @RemiGMI put together a monthly version of the ECRI by averaging the 4 weekly data points. It gives a 100% chance of recession. The weekly version is not confirming that yet. @businesscycle https://t.co/3S1VkSZuGp
