1077,2019-02-22 20:30:23+00:00,sentimentrader,"The smart money just keeps right on buying. In early February, their net position in index futures was on par with market lows in 2011 and 2015-16.

This is extremely unusual, since they usually sell into rising markets. https://t.co/rVq7etycOM"

Those were November 29, 2002.
And today."
1082,2019-02-14 17:05:03+00:00,sentimentrader,"Out of major U.S. sectors and overseas indexes, the McClellan Oscillator is most stretched on Industials and the Shanghai Composite.

For the Shanghai, our Backtest Engine shows that a reading &gt; 90 preceded a tough market in the week ahead. https://t.co/4S1c5I3ILw"
1083,2019-02-13 19:51:01+00:00,sentimentrader,@BillFerensen Makes sense from the index levels. Any idea why they would not be consistent in measuring either price OR spread?
1084,2019-02-13 19:47:50+00:00,sentimentrader,Can anyone explain why credit default swap prices on high-yield bonds (white) have such a large negative correlation to that on investment-grade bonds (orange)? Must be missing something obvious. It's like they're measuring opposite characteristics. https://t.co/2Y9XDdqxY3

1086,2019-02-11 18:46:29+00:00,sentimentrader,"It seems appropriate that the 50th anniversary of the McClellan Oscillator and Summation Index is the year that triggered an all-time extreme in the indicator.

Imagine constructing these by hand each day. *shudder*

1087,2019-02-08 18:25:52+00:00,sentimentrader,"This is a good discussion of the CoT report. Whether it's ""new"" or ""novel"" is highly debatable and maybe it's not a good sign that academics are latching onto a concept, and approach, that traders have been using for decades.

1088,2019-02-07 18:48:30+00:00,sentimentrader,"It has rarely been a good sign when the VIX drops so much during a downtrending market.

1089,2019-02-04 18:50:51+00:00,sentimentrader,"If we accept the 20% thresholds as bull/bear definitions, then the Nasdaq has tended to keep going after it reaches escape velocity. Only bad failures were in 2001.

1092,2019-02-01 15:10:37+00:00,sentimentrader,@OddStats @RampCapitalLLC Whenever I can get around to it. Sparktoro is really useful in this regard. My guess is your account would have risen astronomically since it was last updated due to combo of follower count + engagement + quality of followers.
