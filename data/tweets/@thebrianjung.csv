This is because South Korea has one of the lowest crime rate in the entire world.

Korea: 2019 Per 100k pop. is at 0.58 
U.S: 2019 Per 100k pop is at 6.52 https://t.co/bGrU9BgZJu"
13,2022-10-11 03:07:30+00:00,thebrianjung,"The term ""your gut is your second brain"" is real. Google it-

In Korea, before you eat a meal sometimes they serve you Yuk-Su which is bone broth in a tea cup.

Bone Broth has amazing health benefits and is SO good for the gut.

17,2022-10-11 03:07:28+00:00,thebrianjung,"The other 30-40% comes from the current strength of the U.S Dollar.

Right now because the foreign exchange currency rate for the dollar is OP my $1:1 dollar is worth around 1:$1.30- $1.40 in Korea.

Basically an average of around 35% off on anything I buy from the dollar. https://t.co/BKI1H74E50"
18,2022-10-11 03:07:28+00:00,thebrianjung,"As an American each meal is over 50 - 60% off.

In Korea you don't tip like in the U.S. When I eat out I normally tip pretty generously, but not having this has saved me thousands of dollars alone so far.

From this minimum I save 20% on my meal."
19,2022-10-11 03:07:27+00:00,thebrianjung,"Food is delicious. 

I haven't had one bad meal yet. 

Thing's aren't loaded with sugar like it is in the U.S. 

There's a fine balance between savory and sweet.
