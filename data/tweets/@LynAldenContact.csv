Nobody would. Now make it BTC.

And all banks become very risky with no printable insurance."
2039,2022-10-24 01:59:33+00:00,LynAldenContact,"@brockm Right so on one hand you have BTC, and then on another hand you have an instrument that is only partially backed by BTC but is treated as the same price.

That was the 1913-1971 system and it de-pegged twice. People relying on the peg eventually get rekt."
2040,2022-10-24 01:56:57+00:00,LynAldenContact,"@brockm It would be a problem and then it would blow up since it couldn't be bailed out.

During 1913-1971, bank credit creation had no connection to gold, which is why the system had to default on its gold peg twice.

In free-banking, it had more of a connection. And debt was lower."

2045,2022-10-24 01:43:38+00:00,LynAldenContact,"@brockm Credit would still be important for shorter-term or high-ROIC applications, but the incessant background incentive to short fiat by taking out unnecessary permanent loans, or to perceive bank deposits as being risk free, becomes untenable."

The median house has lost value vs gold over the long run. So no, that only makes sense to do in fiat.

Same thing for corporate debt structures. The ""always have debt"" model would make less sense."

2048,2022-10-24 01:31:06+00:00,LynAldenContact,"@brockm Credit would still exist, but not at the ratio that it currently does.

A significant percentage of credit only exists because fiat is debased at the base level, and banks can always be bailed out nominally.

7711,2021-12-02 20:28:53+00:00,LynAldenContact,@EPBResearch @MacroAlf That's why for example Russell Napier talks about regulations forcing the private sector to buy bonds in a  financial repression scenario rather than having the central bank keep doing it.
