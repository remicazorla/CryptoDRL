412,2021-08-04 15:16:46+00:00,katherineykwu,I definitely don't think Gensler is out of touch or that he doesn't understand crypto- and I for sure want both sides (crypto community and regulators) to be collaborative and raise the bar to exclude bad actors.

i think i also got caught up in this weird idea that my online presence is somehow worthless unless I can produce valuable or insightful content. part of it was the intense imposter syndrome i felt trying to “feel” the way i “project” online"
460,2021-07-07 02:20:56+00:00,katherineykwu,"no other industry can compare to the sheer passion and energy— and just how much FUN crypto is

yes, things are still chaotic and ridiculous and crazy— that hasn’t changed. 

but wowww i’ve genuinely missed how much everyone just LOVES what they do and have fun with it"

towards the end of last year I was feeling super uninspired and burned out, which then me to a full offline break

in the past few months ive re-immersed myself back into crypto full-time and I’ve never been more energized"

540,2021-03-03 14:55:22+00:00,katherineykwu,"@rumimorales Yes, and as someone who tends to overthink most interactions- I definitely agree.

546,2021-03-02 20:20:26+00:00,katherineykwu,"There's enough discourse on how glamorous and exciting the job seem to be, and I have never taken the opportunity for granted 🙏🏻 

But there is needed space for people in the industry to be more vulnerable-- and more supported."
547,2021-03-02 20:20:26+00:00,katherineykwu,"Be prepared to become your job. 

All of a sudden, your entire identity can be swept up into your job, and a lot of aspects of your life can start to feel transactional (i.e. your interests, hobbies, the people you spend time with, who you present yourself as online, etc)."
548,2021-03-02 20:20:25+00:00,katherineykwu,"There are a lot of instances where shit happens and you just can't take it personally-- and that can be really tough advice to follow. 

I've cried more at work than I care to admit in the past two years (though WFH certainly makes it easier than ever to cry at work..)"
549,2021-03-02 20:20:25+00:00,katherineykwu,"No matter how collaborative you want to be, there is always a clear winner and a clear loser in a deal.  In order to 'win', sometimes your elbows really need to be quite sharp in your dealings."
550,2021-03-02 20:20:25+00:00,katherineykwu,"Despite meeting more people than you could ever possibly fit in your calendar, you'll also feel quite lonely and isolated most of the time. 

Most VC investment teams are quite small, and VCs usually operate (meetings, research, diligence, form opinions) solo."
551,2021-03-02 20:20:25+00:00,katherineykwu,"Being a VC inherently means having the self-confidence and self-importance to step into a role with a lot of perceived power and authority. 

If you can't get there due to intense imposter syndrome, it will only get worse (I've struggled the most with this, and still struggle)."
552,2021-03-02 20:20:24+00:00,katherineykwu,Some hard truths about being a VC that I learned the hard way:

624,2020-11-19 06:03:00+00:00,katherineykwu,Fast forward to 2019- a third party by the name of Joseph Arcaro somehow was granted custodianship over this forgotten shell company by appealing to a NV judge https://t.co/fnrv8URqbU
625,2020-11-19 06:02:59+00:00,katherineykwu,"Fwiw companies set up off shore vehicles all the time for all kinds of reasons, and in 2006, two companies by the same name (Tongji) were set up in the US: One in Nevada, the other in Colorado. The one in Colorado was eventually dissolved, but unfortunately the NV was forgotten."

Note: the generally used coffee to water weight ratio is 1:17 or so; for 36 grams of coffee you want to pour 612g worth of water— but for ease I just round up to like the 700ml mark, which makes 2 cups!

Goodluck &amp; enjoy! 🥰✨"
778,2020-08-19 19:12:43+00:00,katherineykwu,"5. Boil water! 

For drip coffee, it would make your life a lot easier to get a hot water kettle with a longer sprout because it makes the pouring easier, but to be honest for a long time I was using just a regular hot water kettle so def not necessary!

831,2020-07-30 14:12:43+00:00,katherineykwu,"So this program will start small, because it just me, Nick, and Alex who are behind the scenes-- and we've also asked and enlisted the help of some absolute superstar NYC based founders, operators, investors 🌟

Please apply- RT/ shares appreciated! 🙏🏻

832,2020-07-30 14:12:42+00:00,katherineykwu,"A big part of this, as we’ve realized, is that collectively as an industry, it should take more outreach to find talent (as opposed to waiting for inbound or warm intros).

https://t.co/lpkaGCPOIw"
833,2020-07-30 14:12:42+00:00,katherineykwu,"There’s a lot more nuance to this, but I truly think that part of what makes my job feel much more rewarding than anything I’ve done before is that I can try- in a small way- to encourage and find underestimated + talented people and give them my knowledge and network."
834,2020-07-30 14:12:42+00:00,katherineykwu,"And so when you look around a table in a fundraising meeting, or a board meeting, some people are there likely because they were once told by someone that they could be, or because they knew someone who had the connections to help them."
835,2020-07-30 14:12:41+00:00,katherineykwu,"The thing is— not all of us grew up being told that we can be whatever we wanted. Not all of us were in environments that encouraged us to be the next [insert name of big CEO here]. 

And for a lot of people, there's a serious barrier when it comes to network and connections."

862,2020-07-13 14:51:45+00:00,katherineykwu,"So for now, I'm patiently waiting, learning, trying new products, and ultimately continue to be optimistic in the long term for the future of crypto as an asset class (which has its ups and downs), knowing that there will be a ton of bumps in the road ahead, and that's also ok."
863,2020-07-13 14:51:45+00:00,katherineykwu,"Other areas like healthcare, insurance, real estate, etc-- these are all complicated areas with a ton of regulatory burden and inefficiency.

And yet I continue to see new businesses built in these industries (which all have been around for much longer than crypto has)."
864,2020-07-13 14:51:45+00:00,katherineykwu,"As much as we try to abstract away the complicated part of interacting with crypto apps or incorporating crypto to UX via better designs, the fact of the matter is that a lot of these crypto concepts are still weird, hard to understand, and at times unnecessarily complicated."
865,2020-07-13 14:51:44+00:00,katherineykwu,"In the short term: the fiat to crypto / traditional fintech to crypto gap will remain near impossible in the meantime (especially in the U.S); crypto apps only used by crypto-native users; and honestly, maybe that's ok for now!"
866,2020-07-13 14:51:44+00:00,katherineykwu,"Though- I don't really see this as a nail in the coffin for all crypto companies trying to bridge the crypto// ""traditional"" financial asset class. 

It just means that now we have more information to build the next version of a heavily-regulated financial product (I.e. coinbase)"
867,2020-07-13 14:51:44+00:00,katherineykwu,"In the meantime, I think this will encourage DEXs, crypto-to-crypto ""swaps"" or transactions (we are already seeing the explosion in the various defi products; more value locked in defi every day); and less of the traditional fintech biz methods applied to crypto businesses."
868,2020-07-13 14:51:43+00:00,katherineykwu,The reality here now is that any crypto businesses that want onboard the next million non-crypto native users by touching fiat or traditional fintech products will have to navigate intense financial regulations/ requirements. But these headaches happen in other industries too.
869,2020-07-13 14:51:43+00:00,katherineykwu,"-- especially if it touches ""traditional"" asset classes (here it was the Stock/ ETF thing that really got Abra in trouble), no matter the underlying tech (transactions done on the bitcoin blockchain/ contracts created for each tx), and no matter where in the world ops get moved."
870,2020-07-13 14:51:42+00:00,katherineykwu,One narrative within crypto today is that it is financial engineering on steroids- a statement that I partially agree with. But that also means businesses built around that narrative will fall under the same regulatory scrutiny as traditional financial institutions--

1011,2020-05-12 18:11:39+00:00,katherineykwu,@hellofrombea But Denver is still a “city” and reason you can do these things at home w friends is presumably because you have proximity + opportunities to meet tons of interesting people/ friends!
1012,2020-05-12 18:09:18+00:00,katherineykwu,"@br_ttany I thought about that too, but are people really going hiking every day?? Like it’s 100% possible to get out into nature on the weekends even if I lived in a big city - easy day trip, train or car, upstate"

1135,2020-02-23 21:07:35+00:00,katherineykwu,And sometimes it’s the imposter syndrome (which I’ve talked about before) that gets compounded even further during meetings when I become hyper aware of the fact that I’m the only woman in the room and no one bothers to really address me when talking.
1136,2020-02-23 21:07:35+00:00,katherineykwu,Or someone will come into my office for a meeting with me and be visibly disappointed that none of my other male colleagues are in the office.

But it did affect my sense of self worth and confidence and made me think that ”success” had to be a certain way and that was not me."
1301,2019-12-08 20:23:42+00:00,katherineykwu,"Then high school. I didn’t get bullied in high school, but it was something else: I felt very, very invisible. I wasn’t particularly disliked or liked- just never really thought about. 

I had one friend that I hung out with and when she was busy I’d just keep to myself."
1302,2019-12-08 20:23:41+00:00,katherineykwu,Lots of meals by myself in the hallways. Begged the school librarian to let me help her sort books so I’d have something to do during breaks between classes. Reads TONS of books- and spent a lot of time in the computer lab!

1328,2019-12-02 16:31:35+00:00,katherineykwu,"Quick storytime: a few years ago, I came across this same tweet from USV calling for applications. 

I had no friends in venture/ tech, but I was obsessed with crypto. I threw in an application (I wrote a response on bitcoin, and then also submitted a video about crypto lol)."

1372,2019-11-14 03:17:10+00:00,katherineykwu,"At the end of the day, the people who end up hurt the most by Instagram removing likes are influencers themselves. 

When a platform owns your followers, that platform also has the power to take away your influence once they realize the $$ value is accruing to you."
1373,2019-11-14 03:17:09+00:00,katherineykwu,"BTW- brands will actually prefer this because through Instagram (in reality this is all done by Facebook’s ad manager- there’s no difference), targeted ads will be much more effective. With organic influencers it’s hard to reach a very specific crowd. So ROI for brands is better."
1374,2019-11-14 03:09:23+00:00,katherineykwu,"@_ConnerBrown_ Brand will still use influencers.

https://t.co/Mr09MAvi6P"
1476,2019-10-01 18:21:30+00:00,katherineykwu,@triketora lmfao this is not ok
1477,2019-10-01 18:09:03+00:00,katherineykwu,"Btw— combined with the EOS case, it sort of also showed that as long as you register your securities offerings (this doesn’t seem to be in much dispute now), do your KYC, and can show that you’ve built something, the SEC had no reason to shut you down entirely."
1478,2019-10-01 18:09:02+00:00,katherineykwu,"So WHAT DOES THIS MEAN? Well, I guess it's more about what was NOT said in the settlement, which is the 2018 Siafund sale done under Reg D and Siacoins(the one being traded on exchanges)...might be okay? 

And holy-implications (the good kind!) if that is the case."
1479,2019-10-01 18:09:01+00:00,katherineykwu,"BTW I am no investor in Sia nor do I have any stake in the company, but it seems to be that teams that actually builds product are getting off pretty lightly from the SEC."
1480,2019-10-01 18:09:01+00:00,katherineykwu,"I don't want to read too much into tea leaves here, but what the SEC really did was just a slap on the wrist for the 2014 sale..but left the $1.5 million worth of the later token sale alone? 

And as far as I know, none of Sia's operations are affected."
1481,2019-10-01 18:09:00+00:00,katherineykwu,"So far, so good. 

BUT I do think it's interesting (and weird?) that 

1. the SEC went after a super small amount of $$ raised from 2014 (well before the DAO report, btw); 

2. that not one word of the 2018 Reg D Siafunds sale or Siacoins was mentioned or even addressed."
1482,2019-10-01 18:09:00+00:00,katherineykwu,"What the SEC went after here is the super low-hanging fruit of the 120k raised back in 2014, which is undeniable a security. 

Sia had to cough up twice that amount as penalties, and basically agreed to contact the SEC prior to issuing any new type of token in the future."
1483,2019-10-01 18:08:59+00:00,katherineykwu,"SIDENOTE on Sia's token structure (which is confusing af): 

Sia implemented a two-token network—Siafunds (the rev-share token) and Siacoins (their utility token). Anytime someone buys storage on the network, a small transaction fee is distributed to the Siafunds."
1484,2019-10-01 18:08:58+00:00,katherineykwu,"So from what I understand, Sia did two entirely different rounds of fundraising: there was one from 2014 back when David (the founder)raised his 'sianotes' in ~ 120k from a forum; and then there was the ""siafunds"" Reg-D sale from 2018."
1485,2019-10-01 18:08:54+00:00,katherineykwu,"A lot of the U.S. crypto-related SEC enforcement actions/ settlements in 2019 have been swift, and largely have dealt with pretty scammy actors.

But the one with Sia is particularly interesting (and different!) to me for a few reasons..

1579,2019-08-22 16:13:43+00:00,katherineykwu,"@OurielOhayon I meant this more directed to companies that used 'regulatory uncertainty' as a shield-- for the record, I do think there is room for regulatory changes that would be more startup-friendly, and even other areas like accredited investor laws."
1580,2019-08-22 16:12:22+00:00,katherineykwu,"@OurielOhayon It's sort of a double-edged sword. On one hand, I 100% feel the frustrations of sinking capital into legal + compliance costs as a startup (which isn't unique to crypto), but on the other hand, I also don't think we should do away with proper laws (re the ICO scams from 2017)."
1581,2019-08-22 16:06:24+00:00,katherineykwu,"With INX's IPO filing, Props &amp; Blockstack's Reg A approval, Securitize as an SEC-registered transfer agent, NYDFS granting more Bitlicenses, and a growing body of legal precedent, the 'we can't comply w US laws b/c of regulatory uncertainy' argument is less compelling by the day."

1588,2019-08-20 17:50:49+00:00,katherineykwu,@TheBlueMatt @sqcrypto @ChaincodeLabs amazing. congrats matt!!
1589,2019-08-18 23:06:16+00:00,katherineykwu,@jamescmlin Also I think people have different definitions and personal views of what “sucks” in a job. I can say that I love my job but I have friends who would hear about my day to day and be like..ok well good for you but your jobs sounds awful to me.
1590,2019-08-18 23:05:07+00:00,katherineykwu,"@jamescmlin I don’t think that pay and personal fulfillment has to be mutually exclusive. But my point was more about figuring out the “what would make you enjoy your job” part and then optimize for that. If it’s just money, and money = fulfillment, then one should optimize for that."
1591,2019-08-18 22:22:57+00:00,katherineykwu,"@wes_dewayne I agree that defining yourself by your work is a very one-dimensional self-identity framework, but I don’t think it’s exclusive to American culture!"
1592,2019-08-18 22:19:19+00:00,katherineykwu,"@richard_tull 100 agree- and I guess one point I didn’t have space to make was that money/ hours/ pay and fulfillment don’t necessary have to be mutually exclusive. Also, my advice obviously targets those who are in a privileged position to begin with and makes some sweeping assumptions!"
1593,2019-08-18 19:47:59+00:00,katherineykwu,"Anyway, if you're unhappy in your role right now, and feel really frustrating/ confused/ stuck, I promise you that it's a normal feeling, and that it's okay to take your time to figure things out. Just make sure you are prioritizing the right things as you take that next step! 💫"
1594,2019-08-18 19:47:59+00:00,katherineykwu,"I've said this before, but I really do think that the reason why job-searching is so exhausting is because it's less about what you think it is (pay/title- though that definitely matters) and more about a lesson in yourself (what am I good at, and what makes me feel fulfilled)."
1595,2019-08-18 19:47:58+00:00,katherineykwu,"The other thing that I tell people is to dig deep and take time to figure out your own 'superpower'. Some of my most creative and extraverted friends are in a cubicle at large corporations. They're great at their jobs, but would likely excel in a more creative and social role."
1596,2019-08-18 19:47:58+00:00,katherineykwu,"I feel like so many people focus on the external factors (wage/location/industry/hours) and not on the values that matter more personally (more creativity? more learning? more/less autonomy?).

The difference between the two is in intrinsic motivation + personal fulfillment."
1597,2019-08-18 19:47:58+00:00,katherineykwu,"By the way, I don't think the problem is with people being complacent or not trying to change their job situation. I think the problem is with identifying the 'Why'.

A lot of my friends will move cities or industries, only to come back to the same unhappy conclusion."
1598,2019-08-18 19:47:57+00:00,katherineykwu,"Spent the weekend w/ a large group of friends and every single person, regardless of industry, talked about how much they hate their jobs- but 'whatever, it's fine, everyone hates it'. 

It really shouldn't be fine or normal. We spend at least 50% of our waking hours at our jobs."

1600,2019-08-15 21:10:05+00:00,katherineykwu,"In case you didn't know:

In China (and a number of other Asian countries), stock market prices are shown in red if they go up, and green if they go down.

So if you ever see a screen in China with share prices that are mostly green, it means you're looking at massive declines. https://t.co/SaohKH0L87"

1606,2019-08-13 14:09:11+00:00,katherineykwu,"My final point: 

No one is invincible. And it's easy to think that when you might know others who have done the same thing and got away with it totally unscathed. But it really isn't worth it."
1607,2019-08-13 14:09:10+00:00,katherineykwu,"There is a saying in Chinese: 杀鸡给猴看- ""killing the chicken to scare the monkey' i.e. make an example out of someone in order to scare/threaten the others.

When it comes to insider trading charges, it really doesn't matter how little money you made from that trade."
1608,2019-08-13 14:09:10+00:00,katherineykwu,"The reality is that it truly is hard to catch an insider trading case red-handed, with hard proof.

And that is why when an illegal trading activity can be matched up to a person, those prosecutors will get after it hard."
1609,2019-08-13 14:09:09+00:00,katherineykwu,"When I had worked on insider trading cases at the SEC, I spent most of my time pouring over trading data and patterns.

I know this situation might sound so obvious, but I promise you that every single person who does this truly thinks that they won't be the ones to get caught."
1610,2019-08-13 14:09:09+00:00,katherineykwu,"Unbeknownst to you, the SEC has been monitoring all activity related to this company for months now. And they find your trade in no time. The next thing you know, you are facing both civil charges and looking at jail time."
1611,2019-08-13 14:09:09+00:00,katherineykwu,"The day of the acquisition finally comes, and on the day of the announcement, you sell those options for an easy profit.

Boom, so easy. And hey, you can't be the only one who's done it, right? Plus, who's gonna care about the couple thousand dollars that you made?"
1612,2019-08-13 14:09:08+00:00,katherineykwu,"With this piece of information, maybe you go off and buy call options in a company that you confidentially know is going to get acquired. And maybe you hide this account from your employer-- because well, you know someone else who doesn't report all their accounts, either."
1613,2019-08-13 14:09:08+00:00,katherineykwu,"I know we all know that insider trading is wrong and illegal. But I think that sometimes we do things because we *think* we can get away with it.

For example, maybe you come across a piece of confidential information. You've seen it. So have the 50+ other people on your team."
1614,2019-08-13 14:09:07+00:00,katherineykwu,"Sincere PSA:

Breaking federal securities laws has serious consequences. Something like insider trading carries both civil and criminal (i.e. jail sentence) penalties.

It doesn't matter how little you profit or how infrequently you do it. Once you're caught, you're done."

1774,2019-07-08 21:15:15+00:00,katherineykwu,"Also notes that the record keeping rules broker-dealer to evidence the existence of digital asset securities for the purposes of the broker-dealer’s regulatory books, records, and financial statements, including supporting schedules would be difficult."
1775,2019-07-08 21:15:14+00:00,katherineykwu,"Interesting caveat from the SEC, where they acknowledge that those who wish to custody crypto assets “may find it challenging to comply with the BD financial responsibility rules w/o putting in place significant technological enhancements and solutions unique to [crypto]. “"
1776,2019-07-08 21:15:13+00:00,katherineykwu,"Generally speaking, the agencies are not super concerned with noncustodial activities (ie OTC in secondary markets)— but entities that perform functions to facilitate the clearance &amp; settlement of transactions in digital asset securities may have to register as a clearing agency."
1777,2019-07-08 21:15:13+00:00,katherineykwu,"Some issues that were mentioned:

+ Re: custody- the fact that a broker-dealer maintains the private key != exclusive control. (e.g., it may not be able to demonstrate that no other party has a copy of the private key and could transfer the digital asset security)"
1778,2019-07-08 21:15:13+00:00,katherineykwu,"The SEC + FINRA just released a joint statement essentially explaining why FINRA has taken its sweet time (that is an understatement) to approve any pending broker-dealer license. 

TLDR: still too many open questions for the agencies to get comfortable

1797,2019-07-02 14:16:48+00:00,katherineykwu,@RisaWechsler So amazing- congratulations to you on an achievement that I have no doubt was 100%+ deserving. This is so inspiring to read 🌟
1798,2019-07-02 13:55:15+00:00,katherineykwu,Anyway writing all of this and saying 'teens' and 'kids' have made me feel super ancient and deeply 'uncool' this AM
1799,2019-07-02 13:55:15+00:00,katherineykwu,"On Snapchat (2): I think that my generation (later-Millenials) entirely over-saturated the world with picture perfect realities (i.e if this isn't perfect I won't post it to social media)- but with finstas, snaps , etc-- I think social media will get more authentic with time."
1800,2019-07-02 13:55:15+00:00,katherineykwu,"On Snapchat (1): If you ask any of my friends (in their 20s), they'd tell you that Snapchat is dead and that Instagram has totally eclipsed that usage. But I think Snap is still the #1 communicating tool for a lot of teens. (Streaks, unbeatable AR effects, disappearing messages)"
1801,2019-07-02 13:55:15+00:00,katherineykwu,"On Twitter: This is just funny to me, because a lot of middle/ high schoolers think of Twitter as an 'app for grown-ups'. (god, that makes me feel SO old)."
1802,2019-07-02 13:55:15+00:00,katherineykwu,"On TikTok (4): So I think that the lesson there is-- the sense of community ONLINE is real. But also, don't be *that* adult this summer asking 'hey are you kids on tiktok'-- they likely won't admit to it, and it doesn't get you any cool points. :)"
1803,2019-07-02 13:55:14+00:00,katherineykwu,"On TikTok (2): Of course, I think Tiktok will see a spike in creators in the next month or two, given that most of its user are on summer break (more free time with friends). Even though it's not 'cool' to say that you're on TikTok, it's still a fun thing to create skits/ dances."
1804,2019-07-02 13:55:14+00:00,katherineykwu,"On TikTok (1): Despite what you may have read or heard, a lot of teens view Tiktok as a 'guilty pleasure'-- i.e not something you'd admit you spend time on (or creating). The best analogy I can think of is Yelp- everyone uses it, no one admits to writing reviews."
1805,2019-07-02 13:55:14+00:00,katherineykwu,"On crypto (2): So the lesson here is more around teaching kids about investing and saving early on. They want USD because they want to immediately be able to buy cool clothes/ shoes etc, and think of 'investing' as a grown-up thing."
1806,2019-07-02 13:55:14+00:00,katherineykwu,"On crypto (1): if you asked (US) teenagers if they prefer to receive $100 in USD or in bitcoin, most of them will still say USD. That's because they see bitcoin as an 'investment' (like stocks). They don't have an issue accepting the fact that bitcoin is a valuable asset."
1807,2019-07-02 13:55:14+00:00,katherineykwu,"Building the 'next XYZ for Gen Z' means to actually go and use and read whatever it is that the smartphone-native generation spends most of their time on instead of pontificating on what they might like/ hate/ use/ think. Examples: crypto, tiktok, twitter, snapchat. 👇"

1814,2019-06-26 13:36:25+00:00,katherineykwu,"As we head into another bull run, I just wanted to say this: 

There’s nothing wrong about selling your crypto holdings if you need the cash to cover your expenses or to give yourself a financial cushion.

1875,2019-06-11 17:18:28+00:00,katherineykwu,Don't get me started on the influencer (called 'KOLs') marketing scene in China and how much money goes into that industry. Not to mention how absolutely pivotal for it is for any brand strategy in China.
1876,2019-06-11 17:18:28+00:00,katherineykwu,"There are actual companies with people whose job is it to act as an agent for brands to look for the best influencers for a campaign, negotiate those rates, direct the shots, plan out the post format (duration/ stories/ captions/ links). It's honestly a lot of work."
1877,2019-06-11 17:18:28+00:00,katherineykwu,oh and also demanding proof like 'well WHO ARE these influencers and what are their names and what's so special about them' uh do you know how stupid that sounds
1878,2019-06-11 17:18:28+00:00,katherineykwu,"""... you said ""Influencers""? You mean to tell me that young women today can make decent money just to post some pretty photos? well well what a world we live in, kids don't know what hard work means anymore"" 

lmao what kinda ignorant sexist remark is that"
1879,2019-06-11 17:18:27+00:00,katherineykwu,btw I'm fucking mindblown at all these articles describing investor reactions during the Revolve roadshow re: influencer marketing as if it's some hot ~trend~ and not a $20 billion (At least? just in the US?) industry
1880,2019-06-11 17:18:27+00:00,katherineykwu,More brands are starting to catch on to the concept of influencer marketing-- and starting to do them really well. There's a lot of opportunities for newer brands (that make higher quality clothes &amp; work well w influencers- a growing career choice) to catch up quickly.
1881,2019-06-11 17:18:27+00:00,katherineykwu,"Revolve's growth story is amazing &amp; I respect them for being one of the first brands to utilize influencer marketing. 

That being said, I'm bearish on its future. Extremely high return rate ($385m out of 400m revenue) +notorious for treating influencers who work w them like shit"
1882,2019-06-11 17:18:27+00:00,katherineykwu,"Quick rant about Revolve + influencer marketing

1908,2019-06-09 18:52:58+00:00,katherineykwu,@AriDavidPaul interesting thread. i think consumer goods are increasingly about the brand/story/connection. take Away suitcases for example- not luxury but def not cheap either. glossier is the same. i actually think this middle tier between like mass-produce goods// high end is growing.

1988,2019-05-20 19:00:25+00:00,katherineykwu,"@ljxie SAME, I learned the dress thing (and how they get a lot shorter when I sit down) the hard way. So distracting for me and audience, plus makes me feel soooo self conscious (on top of the nerves!!)."
1989,2019-05-20 17:34:54+00:00,katherineykwu,@sytaylor Haha you must be more of a natural than me. If I don’t lossen up beforehand with small talk my voice comes out all panicked and weird 😂
1990,2019-05-20 16:57:57+00:00,katherineykwu,@cycryptr Haha that feeling is TOO real 😭
1991,2019-05-20 16:42:54+00:00,katherineykwu,@soonaorlater i really tried but in the first like 2 mins of the first episode someone's head got chopped off and i was like LOL NOPE that shit will make its way into my nightmares and i dont need that
1992,2019-05-20 16:35:58+00:00,katherineykwu,"6/ Last but not least, have fun. Remember that you are on the panel because you know your shit, and we are all here to learn. Everyone else is just as nervous. You got this!!!!! 💪🏻"
1993,2019-05-20 16:35:58+00:00,katherineykwu,"5a/ Instead of 'omg that was horrendous', focus on the small stuff. Is it that you move your hands too much when you talk? That can be easily fixed. Do you say 'um' too much? That's also solvable!! These are small things that you CAN fix. Nothing too bad :)"
1994,2019-05-20 16:35:58+00:00,katherineykwu,"5/ Overachiever move: force yourself to listen/ watch your talk afterwards. Don't be too critical, but also take notes of the stuff that you want to change, and VISUALIZE it for your next talk."
1995,2019-05-20 16:35:58+00:00,katherineykwu,"4/ BREATHE!! Controlled breathing while on stage can help level set in terms of being more present, but also can help with physical symptoms. My heart always beats super fast and my palms get sweaty. Take slow, deep breaths in between your talk."
1996,2019-05-20 16:35:58+00:00,katherineykwu,"3a/ Talking to other people about something totally unrelated to the topic helps! It distracts me from my doom day scenarios, and also loosens me up in terms of my voice, my posture, and my ease around other people. Think about it as a warm up before the big game :)"
1997,2019-05-20 16:35:57+00:00,katherineykwu,"3/ Make some small talk before you have to go on stage. If you're an overthinker like me, I tend to invent worst-case scenarios right before i have to go on stage (tripping, falling, saying something stupid)-- and most times than not it'll just stress me out unnecessarily."
1998,2019-05-20 16:35:57+00:00,katherineykwu,"2e/ In reality, you know enough not to need your bullet points, but just the knowledge of having them might help with nerves right before you get on stage. Tell yourself-- you know this stuff, PLUS you've prepared!!"
1999,2019-05-20 16:35:57+00:00,katherineykwu,"2d/ The reason why you practice so much is that EVEN IF stage fright takes over or if I totally blank on stage, I've practiced enough that muscle memory just takes over. The same goes for talking! Plus, think of bullet points as a security blanket."
2000,2019-05-20 16:35:57+00:00,katherineykwu,"2c/ I used to do choreographed dance in high school, and the main ingredient in having a good performance is practice again and again along with music. Sometimes in the middle, there may be a freestyle section."
2001,2019-05-20 16:35:57+00:00,katherineykwu,"2b/ Write down those 3-4 bullet points on a flashcard, in your notes app, or something easy you can glance at the day before + the day of. Don't bring it on stage!! The reason I do this is because it helps me stay on track when nerves take over."
2002,2019-05-20 16:35:57+00:00,katherineykwu,"2a/ Because panel talks are more conversational, there's no point in trying to memorize an entire piece of a talk. Instead, write down the 3-4 bullet points that you want to be able to hit, no matter what."
2003,2019-05-20 16:35:56+00:00,katherineykwu,"2/ Practice! The good news is that before a panel, the moderator will generally host a call that will help you get a general idea of the topics that will be discussed. Even if not, there are some ways to prepare."
2004,2019-05-20 16:35:56+00:00,katherineykwu,"1d/ Example 2: this sounds dumb, but knowing how I will sit helps me to think about what to do with my hands during a panel when other people are talking. Just visualizing what I will physically look like on stage +  minimizing distractions in advance really helps with nerves."
2005,2019-05-20 16:35:56+00:00,katherineykwu,"1c/ Example: if I will be sitting on a high stool, I will wear pants &gt; dress. Holding both a water bottle and a mic while on a high stool is totally impractical so I will leave my water bottle off stage instead of having to worry about it on stage."
2006,2019-05-20 16:35:56+00:00,katherineykwu,"1b/ There are two practical reasons for visualizing. One, it helps me decide on what to wear. The last thing I want to do is to adjust my clothing while on stage- it's distracting + makes me look nervous. Two, it will help me figure out what I need to pay attention to re: posture"
2007,2019-05-20 16:35:56+00:00,katherineykwu,"1a/ Before a talk, I will try and get a visual idea of what the stage will look like, what the set up will be like (what kind of chairs? Am i getting mic'ed up or holding a mic?), and where on the stage I will be."
2008,2019-05-20 16:35:55+00:00,katherineykwu,"1/ Visualisation! A lot of athletes I know tell me that before a match, they actually will try and visualize themselves physically on the court/ in the race and having a good game. The same goes for public speaking!"
2009,2019-05-20 16:35:55+00:00,katherineykwu,"You've been asked to speak on a panel. It's exciting, but also incredibly nerve-racking. I've totally been there!  Here are some tips + tricks that I have learned over the past year-- here's to hoping it will help you as well :)

In fact, this is similar to the logic that KIN had in its Wells response to the SEC. KIN was deadset on the fact that they were a currency (FinCEN territory) &amp; not a security, so none of the SEC’s business. The opposite also works."

2093,2019-04-22 16:09:27+00:00,katherineykwu,"@MugPuntz1 i totally get that. but its easy to just ask a simple 'hey are you ok/ is everything alright' if the body language is clearly off. worst case you made a good faith mistake, but in the scenario that you didn't, i promise you that the relief and gratitude is very real."
2094,2019-04-22 16:04:55+00:00,katherineykwu,"It’s really easy to feel scared and powerless in a situation like that, and as a result not be able to think rationally (feeling trapped &amp; unable to walk away). Having a third person step in is more helpful in those instances than anything else."
2095,2019-04-22 16:04:55+00:00,katherineykwu,I don’t think it’s possible to prevent people from acting like this but I do think it’s possible to encourage more people to step in when they see this happening. For me it was the CVS employee who came up asked if I was ok. The guy left the store after that.
2096,2019-04-22 16:04:54+00:00,katherineykwu,"And my first thought was “what did I do to cause this” which I know is FUCKED yet I kept feeling like somehow this was on me. 

This second guy not only followed me into the store but physically blocked me all while I was on the phone and told me to “chill out” and talk to him."
2097,2019-04-22 16:04:54+00:00,katherineykwu,Yesterday a total stranger grabbed my arm in the subway to get me to talk to him and today another man followed me into a CVS store and blocked my path to “ask about my background”. Both times I had earphones in. Afterwards I went home &amp; angry-cried over how powerless I felt.

2103,2019-04-18 22:53:39+00:00,katherineykwu,@JohnJiao I was FULLY expecting to get yelled at and like maybe even start crying and none of that happened?? Like???

One headache that has plagued token companies in the U.S. is over legally compliant token funding/distribution methods. This is a huge step!"
2116,2019-04-09 21:10:17+00:00,katherineykwu,@Leorzhang Lmao
2117,2019-04-09 18:24:17+00:00,katherineykwu,12/ ALSO!!!! I have no idea how individual provinces will react to this!!! There are definitely provinces where the mining farms congregate in-- and I have no idea what the individual provincial government will do/ if they will prioritize enforcing this.
2118,2019-04-09 18:20:24+00:00,katherineykwu,"11/ TLDR until the rules are set in stone and we actually SEE large mining farms move or shut down, we're all just reading tea leaves here. All I can do is provide background and context and my take on what it may mean. The reality (as it often does) may play out differently. https://t.co/Gk8ul0i3Th"
2119,2019-04-09 18:15:40+00:00,katherineykwu,"10/ In the immediate term, I think local mining farms will continue to operate- rules take time to shape up. But I'm not sure how these large China-based mining firms (ex. Bitmain) will operate-- it's already known that Bitmain seems to be shifting more towards AI by the day."
2120,2019-04-09 18:13:03+00:00,katherineykwu,"9/ That being said, this is one type of activity among literally THOUSANDS that gets listed. Also, as people have pointed out, this type of activity can never truly be 100% 'banned'-- like with marijuana farms etc-- people will still do shit they want to do. It's just riskier."
2121,2019-04-09 18:13:03+00:00,katherineykwu,"8/ I don't want to downplay the potential signifigance of this if the line item were to make it to the final list-- the Chinese government is deliberate in anything that is made publically avalible, so this would 100% raise some concern + red plags."
2122,2019-04-09 18:09:49+00:00,katherineykwu,7/ So what does this all mean?????? https://t.co/Wa8L5fuDz7
2123,2019-04-09 18:09:49+00:00,katherineykwu,"6/ The guidelines for the elimination section has always been those industry/activities that are wasteful or harmful to the environment, do not meet safety standards, or uses too much out-dated equipment. According to that line of thinking, POW mining falls under the first type."
2124,2019-04-09 18:09:49+00:00,katherineykwu,5/ Where the concern within the crypto circle lies is in *ONE* tiny line item among the THOUSANDS of industries within the list. Under the 'elimination section': 'The ‘mining’ of virtual currencies (such as the mining process for bitcoin and other virtual currencies).” https://t.co/VBwodVAt0x

2126,2019-04-09 18:09:48+00:00,katherineykwu,"3/ The last official update was done in 2016, which added things like wind farms as an example of something to be encouraged and harmful beverage packaging as something to be eliminated. Things not listed are defaulted to 'permitted' by the agency."
2127,2019-04-09 18:09:48+00:00,katherineykwu,"2/ Since 2005, the agency has maintained a publicly available list of the industries that the state i) would like to encourage, ii) those they would like to limit, and iii) those they would like to eliminate. The list gets updated and amended every few years."
2128,2019-04-09 18:09:48+00:00,katherineykwu,"1/ Now onto some background: China’s National Development and Reform Commission is the agency that has pretty broad powers in the planning and control of the Chinese economy. 

Because of its broad powers, the agency is often called the ‘mini-Central government’."

2146,2019-04-03 17:31:50+00:00,katherineykwu,LMAO so the SEC basically says 'we know that the courts + law say one thing but we don't think that matters' AND THEN QUOTES THEMSELVES via a supplemental brief which basically is like me saying 'i know what the laws say but idc' and quotes my own blog post to prove myself right

2153,2019-04-03 15:52:57+00:00,katherineykwu,"22/ IN CONCLUSION, the framework is definitely a cumulation of the cautionary lessons that we've learned from the SEC's past enforcement actions (don't shill your token $ value, actually develop a usable token, have a real plan to decentralize out your team, etc)."
2154,2019-04-03 15:52:57+00:00,katherineykwu,"21b/

There are more factors to consider re: is the token less likely to be a security, and I won't copy paste or paraphrase them here, but its in page 9-10 of the framework https://t.co/gfSmFGFn55

(real talk im tired)"
2155,2019-04-03 15:52:57+00:00,katherineykwu,"21a/ 

+ token holders can immediately use it for its intended functionality
on the network

+ if the issuer facilitates the creation of a secondary market, transfers of the digital asset may only be made by and among users of the platform"
2156,2019-04-03 15:52:57+00:00,katherineykwu,"21/ To wrap it up, what are some things that make the tokens LESS likely to be a security under the Howey test?

+ both network and token fully functional and decentralized.
+ Prospects for appreciation in the token are limited (ie people dont expect to HODL for $$$)"
2157,2019-04-03 15:52:56+00:00,katherineykwu,"20/ Important question: what if the token sale was a security (and you didnt register), but now you truly think that your tokens should be re-evaluated since you really don't think it's a security in its form today? *uhemETHERuhem*

Consider these factors then: https://t.co/gpy4bf9R5P"
2158,2019-04-03 15:41:12+00:00,katherineykwu,"19/ Some pretty obvious examples (translating the legalese): If you, as an issuer, successfully shill tf out of your tokens, that's creating a reasonable expectation of profit for your bagholders. If you as an issuer create a trading market for the token, same thing."
2159,2019-04-03 15:41:11+00:00,katherineykwu,"18/ Under the Howey test, if an asset price appreciates as a result solely from external market forces (such as general inflationary trends or the economy), that's not profit. I'm not going into all the factors, but think about what DRIVES your token price appreciation. https://t.co/IX81u50EI2"
2160,2019-04-03 15:41:10+00:00,katherineykwu,"17/ Let's now move onto ""Reasonable Expectation of Profits"" bc lol this fund never ends (and now that I am accountable I can't give up half way) https://t.co/24WA2buA95"
2161,2019-04-03 15:33:44+00:00,katherineykwu,"16/ Points 13-16 really is to say: the SEC has some ideas as to what a 'decentralized network' looks like, and if you have a team who not only issues, sells, and promotes the tokens but also engages in the above, that's (obviously) not decentralized enough."
2162,2019-04-03 15:33:44+00:00,katherineykwu,"15/ An affiliated party are those who created a market for the price of the digital assets (ie limiting supply through buybacks, burning), or plays a lead or central role in deciding governance issues, code updates, etc."
2163,2019-04-03 15:33:43+00:00,katherineykwu,"13/ If you, as the purchaser of the tokens-- reasonably rely on others-- SEC defines it as a promoter, sponsor, or other third party (or affiliated group of third parties) -- to take on significant developments/ changes to the network, that meets most of it. *Keyword: affiliated*"
2164,2019-04-03 15:33:43+00:00,katherineykwu,"12/ The third prong of the Howey test *i.e. Reasonable Expectation of Profits Derived from Efforts of Others"", is the more complicating factor. 

Some important considerations: reliance on others to make your tokens more valuable is generally what they mean by this."
2165,2019-04-03 15:21:00+00:00,katherineykwu,"11/ We know already that each analysis is highly dependent on the facts and circumstances. The first two elements of the Howey test are also the easier ones to analyze: did you sell tokens for $$, and was there a central team developing it? The SEC thinks that most cases, yes. https://t.co/WnstBoFmQP"
2166,2019-04-03 15:21:00+00:00,katherineykwu,"10/ First page and a half: 

a brief explanation of the Howey test, if you sell a security, you must register, we don't care about the form; the information that you disclose must be true, etc. 

I know you all know this already, so am glossing over the introduction."

No-Action letter from the SEC https://t.co/NuAhqj0cXQ

TKJ's original letter https://t.co/bpSDzuEEdC"
2171,2019-04-03 15:08:32+00:00,katherineykwu,"6/ 
My thoughts: 

I was initially excited about this no-action letter, but now I'm realizing its just the SEC saying 'well we aren't going to enforce action since you sold USD- pegged loyalty points for your small air carrier company to your members' 

TY SHERLOCK"
2172,2019-04-03 15:08:32+00:00,katherineykwu,"5b (cont.)

+ TKJ will sell Tokens at a price of one USD per Token throughout the life of the Program, and each Token will represent a TKJ obligation to supply air charter services at a value of one USD per Token

wait lmao so like a USD pegged stablecoin what"
2173,2019-04-03 15:08:32+00:00,katherineykwu,"5a (cont)

+  the Tokens will be immediately usable for their intended functionality (purchasing air charter services) at the time they are sold

+ TKJ will restrict transfers of Tokens to TKJ Wallets only, and not to wallets external to the Platform"
2174,2019-04-03 15:08:32+00:00,katherineykwu,"5/ So the SEC said they won't enforce action if:

+ each token will be fully developed and operational at the time any are sold, and the token sale funds won't go to developing the platform/network/ app"
2175,2019-04-03 15:02:21+00:00,katherineykwu,"4/ Based on a VERY rough summary of the facts, this is basically a small airline that offered a membership program to its members but made it fancy by adding smart contracts (why??) and put it on the blockchain (also whyyy??)"
2176,2019-04-03 15:02:21+00:00,katherineykwu,3/ According to TKJ: The Tokens are nonrefundable. Consumers can only redeem their Tokens for air charter services. And TKJ follows all AML reporting. And it's only for members (everyone has to sign a user agreement)
2177,2019-04-03 15:02:20+00:00,katherineykwu,"2/ TKJ is a small air carrier/operator and owns like 2-3 jets. They launched their own internal token platform to facilitate transactions between the user, brokers (of the flights), and carriers. They also have their own wallets. 

idk why this has to be on a blockchain but ok"
2178,2019-04-03 15:02:20+00:00,katherineykwu,"1/ So first: the no action letter says that the SEC will *not* recommend any action for a token sale for this company called TurnKey Jet (TKJ), because TKJ relied on their counsel's opnion that TKJ tokens are not securitie, and thus offered and sold tokens without registering."
2179,2019-04-03 14:48:17+00:00,katherineykwu,WAIT THEY ALSO ISSUED A NO ACTION LETTER oooh boy my morning is about to get REAL NERDY

2187,2019-04-02 04:00:42+00:00,katherineykwu,@edwardczech I’m a total city girl 👧🏻 so probably am biased re: speaking out loud in public
2188,2019-04-02 03:56:21+00:00,katherineykwu,@jeremyrwelch Would you respond with a voice message if you received one?
2189,2019-04-02 03:50:15+00:00,katherineykwu,@edwardczech oh see i totallly get THAT- i'd never use voice to text because the whole point of leaving audio is so that i can incorporate my tone/ pauses/ etc into the message...although maybe im also just a dramatic af storyteller haha
2190,2019-04-02 03:48:39+00:00,katherineykwu,"@jeremyrwelch haha, that's why i asked the question!! now you have to give me an answer :)"
2191,2019-04-02 03:48:16+00:00,katherineykwu,"@qwoods13 wouldnt that depend on what kind of learner they are? for every one who'd choose text, there's probably also one who would prefer the audio. explains podcast/ audiobooks, no?"
2192,2019-04-02 03:46:50+00:00,katherineykwu,@ecurrencyhodler thats my theory too-- https://t.co/iscfC7UB7L
2193,2019-04-02 03:41:42+00:00,katherineykwu,"@MydasKe that is true, but my friends in london leave a lot of voice messages too via whatsapp"
2194,2019-04-02 03:40:43+00:00,katherineykwu,@JeremyRubin I actually am realizing that I yell into a phone regardless- though conversation volume control is sorta my weakness 😰
2195,2019-04-02 03:38:13+00:00,katherineykwu,@adi__bahri omg yes to tone and im also a fan of dramatic pauses haha
2196,2019-04-02 03:37:26+00:00,katherineykwu,"@daveholtz haha my fav place to do it is when im waiting in a long line (trader joes/ whole foods)-- obviously i wouldnt do it in like, a library!"
2197,2019-04-02 03:34:27+00:00,katherineykwu,"@Edward_ant lol yeah i do like leaving them since its easy for me, and it makes me more likely to keep in touch with my friends."
2198,2019-04-02 03:33:44+00:00,katherineykwu,@cryptograffiti @santisiri @Edward_ant definitely not searchable- but it's not like i'd ever think to search a phone call either. and dont get me started on how shitty the imessage search function is for texts!!
2199,2019-04-02 03:32:44+00:00,katherineykwu,@daveholtz haha oh no  maybe im just *that* asshole who talks on the phone in public while roaming about dense cities😅
2200,2019-04-02 03:31:13+00:00,katherineykwu,"@MetroAuctionsCT LINE, whatsapp, wechat-- basically any messaging app except for iMessage lol"
2201,2019-04-02 03:28:15+00:00,katherineykwu,"@JeremyRubin hmm, would you ever talk on the phone while in a public space?"
2202,2019-04-02 03:27:47+00:00,katherineykwu,"@slashdowntown oh totally, i only play it when my headphones in-- like instead of listening to music i'll play audio messages. idk, there's something about hearing my friend's voice instead of reading words that feel more personal for me and i like that"
2203,2019-04-02 03:26:42+00:00,katherineykwu,"@daveholtz i almost always do it when i'm walking from point A to B -- with my earphones in of course-- but yelling into the phone in public spaces is also pretty normal in nyc, so maybe im biased to think its normal"
2204,2019-04-02 03:24:10+00:00,katherineykwu,@Edward_ant more time consuming than typing out long text messages?
2205,2019-04-02 03:23:35+00:00,katherineykwu,"@daveholtz that's so interesting. i don't think of it as super different from talking on the phone in public. granted its a one-way convo, but it's never a super long message anyway- usually a funny story or something exciting that just happened."
2206,2019-04-02 03:17:54+00:00,katherineykwu,@adi__bahri Sooooo convenient—ex. when you’re just trying to share a funny story from the day with a friend without having to type up an essay
2207,2019-04-02 03:16:45+00:00,katherineykwu,"@trajanmex I like leaving voice messages when I have like a few minutes to spare (usually when Im too lazy to text), and I will totally do it bc the receiver can listen whenever they get a chance. Much better than playing phone tag and the constant “sorry I missed your call!” texts"
2208,2019-04-02 03:14:57+00:00,katherineykwu,"@jacobkostecki Part of my theory is that there’s not really a good function built in. I don’t know about androids, but iMessages (predominantly how people on the US communicate) doesn’t really provide for a good way to leave voice messages (there’s the option, but super confusing to use)"
2209,2019-04-02 03:09:45+00:00,katherineykwu,"Question for my US twitter friends: 

Why do people hate communicating via voice messages so much? 

note: not voicemail, i mean voice messages."
2210,2019-04-02 02:27:17+00:00,katherineykwu,@eriktorenberg this is something i do often with non-U.S. friends on whatsapp/ wechat. dont really get why people in the US have such an aversion to voice messages.

2224,2019-03-28 13:31:10+00:00,katherineykwu,"All that we have so far are actions against really obvious scams, tons of *unofficial* speeches and chats-- and NOT a single line of guidance, no-action letter, or Reg A approval for so many unanswered questions."
2225,2019-03-28 13:31:10+00:00,katherineykwu,"I've talked to crypto projects in the U.S. that are reluctant to launch on mainnet because they want to wait until the US SEC comes out with their guidance. I (obviously) respect that, but DAMN that really frustrates me to hear."
2226,2019-03-28 13:31:09+00:00,katherineykwu,"I know that judicial systems are obviously different among the US/ rest of the world, but this really shows that coming out with timely guidance is not an impossible task for regulators. 

At this point, I think the dialogues are open. The crypto community is engaging in earnest."
2227,2019-03-28 13:31:09+00:00,katherineykwu,"To no one’s surprise, STOs are subject to the same requirements as securities, and they are very much securities under the HK SFC’s eyes.

BUT what is really important here is that this is already the third detailed + clear guidance the HK SFC has issued for cryptoassets."
2228,2019-03-28 13:31:09+00:00,katherineykwu,"After releasing detailed guidance for crypto exchanges and crypto fund managers last fall, the Hong Kong SFC (Securities &amp; Futures Commission) released another (!!!!) guidance for Securities Token Offerings today.

2229,2019-03-26 14:31:10+00:00,katherineykwu,"But Ebang/ Canaan are still also holding on tight to the possibility of their IPO. Canaan supposedly filed for another IPO application after its Hong Kong application lapsed, but this time on the NASDAQ. TBD on how that plays out."
2230,2019-03-26 14:31:10+00:00,katherineykwu,"So with Bitmain's IPO application lapse, this is the last of three China-based mining companies (+ Ebang, Canaan) that have seen their applications to the Hong Kong stock exchange lapse. The HK stock exchange has cited worries about the sustainability of revenue models."
2231,2019-03-26 14:19:03+00:00,katherineykwu,"Seeing that a lot of former Bitmain employees are now at Matrix (a public blockchain project from China), there are rumors that Jihan Wu may get more involved with (or potentially head up) that project as well. Unsubstantiated rumors, so take this w a HUGE grain of salt."
2232,2019-03-26 14:09:16+00:00,katherineykwu,"@tiffani PREACH 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻 

I find it even less compelling when those WITH college/ higher education degree are the ones dispensing advice like this. It’s so irresponsible &amp; cavalier."
2233,2019-03-26 12:14:33+00:00,katherineykwu,"Something that was interesting in the now lapsed Bitmain IPO application from last year was the heavy emphasis on AI chip production. (Took up about the first entire half of the document). 

The recent announcement suggests AI will be ramped up more so.

https://t.co/1dH4kMYnkJ"
2234,2019-03-26 05:34:52+00:00,katherineykwu,"Most importantly, Bitmain has not yet given up on their IPO dreams. 

Even though their IPO application to the Hong Kong stock exchange has lapsed as of this week, they claim to be optimistic about re-filing for the IPO due to their new product offerings."
2235,2019-03-26 05:31:51+00:00,katherineykwu,"For context, Wang was the head of product for Bitmain prior to being named new CEO. Before Bitmain, Wang was a software engineer at Availink, which has a long history of providing chip solutions."
2236,2019-03-26 05:09:11+00:00,katherineykwu,"As confirmed from Bitmain today- 

Haichao Wang in as new CEO (Micree Zhan + Jihan Wu will be “directors” but away from day-to-day ops). 

Unsurprisingly, the blog focuses heavily on their current AI efforts + government partnerships on the AI front."

2312,2019-03-07 15:30:31+00:00,katherineykwu,"11/ I definitely appreciated these two reports that the FCA commissioned. They were fair, asked good questions, and did not end with any over-hyped dangers to the overall markets, or how we should stay away from crypto assets."
2313,2019-03-07 15:30:31+00:00,katherineykwu,"10/ This part is really important: 

Most consumers used Coinbase to buy their crypto because it was often referenced in media. BUT!!  Although some people wanted to use platforms other than Coinbase, they were often unable to understand how they worked.

2314,2019-03-07 15:30:31+00:00,katherineykwu,"9/ Majority of those buyers first heard about crypto from friends/family who claimed to have made a profit.

2318,2019-03-07 15:30:29+00:00,katherineykwu,"5/ Many also seemed to have a sense that they were investing in tangible assets, due to the language and imagery associated with cryptoassets, such as ‘mining’ and ‘coin’."

2320,2019-03-07 15:30:28+00:00,katherineykwu,"3/ Interesting findings: the FCA interviewed about 2,132 UK consumers (16 y/o+).

2321,2019-03-07 15:30:28+00:00,katherineykwu,"2/ While the reports generally found that there is a general poor level of understanding of crypto among UK consumers, the FCA still concludes that—  the overall scale of harm is ’not as high as previously thought”."

2392,2019-02-14 15:51:24+00:00,katherineykwu,@larrysalibra @AriannaSimpson Lol if I don’t say it that explicitly thats when I get the constant “are you sure you don’t want anything to drink” even if I’m like NO WATER IS FINE TY. I get that they have pressure to sell but like come on I know what I want..
2393,2019-02-14 15:46:28+00:00,katherineykwu,"@larrysalibra @AriannaSimpson Sure, that makes sense- but if I say “I am not drinking alcohol” that’s explicit. That could be my way of saying “I’m trying to stay sober” and the continuing “we have a great wine selection” and “are you sure” can get triggering. My reasons for not drinking isn’t $ related."

2396,2019-02-13 20:00:28+00:00,katherineykwu,"Anyway, the whole interview is worth listening to in full here: 

https://t.co/kLt0dPdvBv"
2397,2019-02-13 20:00:28+00:00,katherineykwu,"Since I can't help but tie everything to questions in crypto-building: 

Think about your users, and not in an abstract way. Find ways to engage with them &amp; get their feedback.

Most importantly, humanize your product. Tech != impersonal, and crypto is a people-powered ecosystem."
2398,2019-02-13 20:00:27+00:00,katherineykwu,"Shipping product is important, but so is meaningful engagement with your users/ consumers/ potential hires. I remember seeing a job posting once and there was a section for 'Who you will be working with' w/ people profiles. Great move to humanize the recruiting process."
2399,2019-02-13 20:00:27+00:00,katherineykwu,"Glossier's ""every single person is an influencer"" marketing take is also super thoughtful. For example, before I buy something, I would totally trust a stranger's review over an algo recommended product. Using your consumers as your spokesperson &gt; paying for celebrities."
2400,2019-02-13 20:00:27+00:00,katherineykwu,"And Glossier is actively building out a platform *for* their users. What Glossier does really well is serving the customer to interact with each other. In stores or online, people are answering each other's questions about the product. IMO that's just brilliant."
2401,2019-02-13 20:00:27+00:00,katherineykwu,"As we move more towards 'digital everything', I think that humanizing a process-- any process, really-- will become even more important. The magic of Glossier is really in capturing that sort of authenticity that consumers/ users have started to crave more."
2402,2019-02-13 20:00:27+00:00,katherineykwu,"Glossier's ""cult-like"" consumer following is built on top of those two main points. When users feel heard and connected, they are more likely to engage and share feedback. 

The point ""Amazon really solved buying, but it killed shopping in the process"" totally resonated with me."
2403,2019-02-13 20:00:26+00:00,katherineykwu,"I finally had a chance to listen to @karaswisher interview @EmilyWWeiss (CEO of Glossier), two major takeaways:

+ Your users = your lifeline
+ Humanity is extraordinarily important in connecting with your users (this is especially important for tech companies)"

2411,2019-02-09 19:24:11+00:00,katherineykwu,"Anyway, I know there is a ton more to this debate. Open to book recs on this topic!

If you're looking for something to do this weekend, Professor Lessig (the author) made the entire ""Code v2"" book free in PDF form here: 

https://t.co/kfO12fKCnh"
2412,2019-02-09 19:24:11+00:00,katherineykwu,The complicated thing is that-- your phone contains sensitive records that will reveal far more information than the most exhaustive search of your house. How can that sort of broad power be limited by your right to privacy as under the fourth amendment?
2413,2019-02-09 19:24:11+00:00,katherineykwu,"But emails are instantaneous and happen along machine communications. And to confine the corners of machine communication within laws that are for the physical space is difficult. Then you throw in stuff like: passcode locks on your phone, encryption, P2P file sharing, etc."
2414,2019-02-09 19:24:10+00:00,katherineykwu,"When it comes to the internet and networks, the line between privacy and open/public information is much harder to define. For example, letters in transit are not expected to have a right to privacy, because the intermediaries are human (mailman) and prone to delivery errors."
2415,2019-02-09 19:24:10+00:00,katherineykwu,"In other words-- in the physical world, the expectation of privacy hinges on two major factors: 1. The subjective expectation of privacy, and 2. The expectation that society is willing to recognize as reasonable."
2416,2019-02-09 19:24:10+00:00,katherineykwu,"In the physical world, the line between privacy and open/public information is pretty obvious- when you close the door to your apartment (h/t @soonaorlater for that comparison), you have that reasonable expectation of privacy."
2417,2019-02-09 19:24:10+00:00,katherineykwu,"The online world and the “real” world are different in many respects, and the rules that apply to searches in the “real” world cannot simply be applied to digital searches — whether searches of online networks or searches of physical computers."
2418,2019-02-09 19:24:09+00:00,katherineykwu,"""Code v2"" by @lessig -- even after all these years -- is still such a thought-provoking read. 

One major question I've been pondering lately: how should the fourth amendment protections against unreasonable search and seizures extend to the digital space?"
2419,2019-02-07 23:59:30+00:00,katherineykwu,"Yesssss, huge fan of this initiative @jasonsomensatto! 🤓

2437,2019-01-30 18:51:11+00:00,katherineykwu,"@pkafei @TaylorPearsonMe Thankfully (imo) that did not end up happening. I get that classrooms &amp; degrees can be boring &amp; in the midst of it, feels like you're not learning much. But you can also say that about an entry-level job. In most parts of the world and industries, people still care about degrees."
2438,2019-01-30 18:47:20+00:00,katherineykwu,@nikillinit @TaylorPearsonMe to me the most bizarre thing is realizing that people have created this spilt between their real-life personality and their online presence. it always throws me off so much to meet something IRL and realize they are nothing like their tweets. feels super disingenuous.
2439,2019-01-30 18:45:54+00:00,katherineykwu,@pkafei @TaylorPearsonMe An example where I think this sort of 'drop out' advice is highly irresponsible is this (&amp; I have seen it happen): a rising senior at a top 20 college (no debt) is advised to drop out their last year in order to join a small startup as an operator.
2440,2019-01-30 18:39:27+00:00,katherineykwu,"@TaylorPearsonMe @nikillinit Haha, I usually just tell people that the same rules apply both IRL and online: don't be an asshole. So much of online behavior that is normalized really would be so bizarre if acted out in real life. Treat any social media platform as an extension of your real life presence."
2441,2019-01-30 18:34:20+00:00,katherineykwu,"@TaylorPearsonMe Yeah, I'm curious to see how this evolves into a more 'targeted' or goal-centric way. People keep asking me how to grow their Twitter following by 'tweeting better', and I have no idea what sort of playbook advice to give."
2442,2019-01-30 18:32:20+00:00,katherineykwu,"@TaylorPearsonMe Totally makes sense and something that I've discussed with people around me a lot.

2485,2019-01-23 22:33:55+00:00,katherineykwu,"7/ But this also may be how and why other countries (particularly SE Asia or HK/Taiwan) can jump into the crypto sector by providing frameworks and guidance that are easier to navigate or, in some cases, construct from ground zero."
2486,2019-01-23 22:33:55+00:00,katherineykwu,"6/ The SEC has been so vilified by the crypto-community in the U.S. due to definitions that are rooted in the way that the legal structure is set. The U.S. legal system is based on precedents, and to overrule that usually takes a shit ton of time and legal resources. 🤷🏻‍♀️"
