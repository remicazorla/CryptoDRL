- You are NOT selling BTC - therefore, no capital gains need to be reported. (Confirm with your accountant) 

- You get immediate liquidity and get access to your tax haven passport before the next ATH, giving you more choices for how to handle your assets."

6551,2019-10-10 22:16:00+00:00,KatieTheRussian,10/ FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT - I touched on this topic before.  Having a choice is great. Having foreign ID/ second passport/residency is very helpful because most of the time authorities treat “guests” better than their own citizens. Saved my ass many times! IT WORKS!
6552,2019-10-10 22:16:00+00:00,KatieTheRussian,"9/ EDUCATION - Being a proud drop-out of fake-onomics school, I thank myself for this decision quite often. I escaped indoctrination through FEDucation. There are sources of information much more reliable than your local university and they won’t get you in $200k debt."
6553,2019-10-10 22:16:00+00:00,KatieTheRussian,"8/ FINANCIAL FREEDOM - I feel like here my following is educated the most. We all know how to be your own bank, we have censorship resistant money, we are able to transact without asking anybody and this is great!  #stacksats"
6554,2019-10-10 22:15:59+00:00,KatieTheRussian,"7/ DEFENSE - Know how to protect yourself. There is no limit here as you never know where the danger might come from. Learn self-defense techniques, learn how to shoot. Learn how to run lol. Carry🙊 
P.S. Don't mess with Katie😈 https://t.co/ehEsfIyQXL"
6555,2019-10-10 22:15:58+00:00,KatieTheRussian,"6/ DATA - ah man, y’all know it. Owning your data is hard. But saying you have nothing to hide is stupid. Learn privacy and security practices. You will always be able to open up certain parts of your life."
6556,2019-10-10 22:15:58+00:00,KatieTheRussian,"5/ The traditional health paradigm is built on Pharma companies money. Your well-being makes their business model REKT. Educate yourself, listen to your body, track your performance. Lift, stretch, don’t eat shit. Experiment, learn your body, work with it."
6557,2019-10-10 22:15:57+00:00,KatieTheRussian,"3/  EMOTIONS - For me, emotional sovereignty - consciousness.  Having an addiction or an attachment isn’t healthy. Figure out your trauma. Work through it. Try to understand your subconscious responses and analyze them afterwards. Visit counselor if having troubles."
6558,2019-10-10 22:15:56+00:00,KatieTheRussian,"2/ Unfortunately, in modern society we need to take action to take back control of some areas of our lives. I don’t believe anybody in the world knows what’s better for me than ME. So I would prefer to make decisions for myself without asking permission to do so."
6559,2019-10-10 22:15:56+00:00,KatieTheRussian,"1/ Self-sovereignty?
 *THREAD*

It’s an interesting topic and everyone defines self-sovereignty in his/her own way. 
For me - it’s as simple as being in control of my own life.
I decided to break it down a bit, mostly for myself, but why not share?"

7253,2019-06-29 04:53:16+00:00,KatieTheRussian,"20/ The judge was very nice to me, asked me questions and advised never ever do it again. Later I found out the worst case scenario could be 30 days in jail and $5k. I am flying to Puerto Rico on Sunday so thanks for not throwing me in a cage."
7254,2019-06-29 04:53:16+00:00,KatieTheRussian,"19/ Around 4 pm, apparently one of Craig’s representatives read my tweets and reported to the judge. After another break I was invited back to the court room for a, “talk.” #russianspy"
7255,2019-06-29 04:53:16+00:00,KatieTheRussian,"18/ I was trying to set aside my opinion on the whole story, and interpret the cross-examination how the judge (or others) might see it. Even so, even the interns expressed an unmistakeable level of incredulity."
7256,2019-06-29 04:53:15+00:00,KatieTheRussian,"17/ There were many companies mentioned, one wrapped up into another and co-owned through multisigs.  I wish they just had a whiteboard to draw it all out. Perhaps starting with, Tulip Limited, or Coin LTD, (sic)."
7257,2019-06-29 04:53:15+00:00,KatieTheRussian,16/ The hearing continued despite the expiration of official court house hours. None of the witnesses had time to participate today. There will be another hearing scheduled soon.
7258,2019-06-29 04:53:15+00:00,KatieTheRussian,"15/ Apparently, IF David set up the time release the way CSW and David discussed, he is supposed to gain access to another key in Jan or Dec 2020."
7259,2019-06-29 04:53:15+00:00,KatieTheRussian,"14/ Side note: I really felt bad for the stenographer, when they were going through tech staff. It was hilarious when he asked how to spell @GitHub"
7260,2019-06-29 04:53:14+00:00,KatieTheRussian,"13/ So the document demand in court, is supposedly under control of 15 keys. It requires 8 out of 15 to decrypt, AND in a particular order. I still couldn’t  ascertain how many keys he personally has exactly … maybe … seven?"
7261,2019-06-29 04:53:14+00:00,KatieTheRussian,"12/ It became clear to me that - someone tried to falsify email metadata - but after changing the DATE (day, months and year) of the email, *they forgot to change what day of the week it was.*"
7262,2019-06-29 04:53:14+00:00,KatieTheRussian,11/ Cross-examination was a bomb! I was very impressed with ability of the lawyer to go through lines of code with a great confidence. Calling falsified emails and other documents by providing data from servers.
7263,2019-06-29 04:53:13+00:00,KatieTheRussian,10/ The most emotional moment was when CSW was asked why he left bitcoin and decided to disassociate with Satoshi’s pseudonym. “I was ashamed of my invention. They used it for child porn and hard drugs. I didn’t want to be a part of it so I left. I even stopped being a pastor.”
7264,2019-06-29 04:53:13+00:00,KatieTheRussian,"9/ After that we went on a long side track of agreeing what is a public address and what it stands for, in the community"
7265,2019-06-29 04:53:13+00:00,KatieTheRussian,"8/ CSW and his lawyer: Are you satoshi? -Yes. Do you recognize this White Paper? -Yes. If you had a chance to provide the BTC addresses, would you? -Public Address is not an existing thing on Bitcoin network."
7266,2019-06-29 04:53:12+00:00,KatieTheRussian,7/ Now back to today’s trial. CSW was supposed to present public addresses of the funds held in BTC he acquired before the end of 2013 but he still hasn’t done it.
7267,2019-06-29 04:53:12+00:00,KatieTheRussian,6/ Later it seem to appear that David actually owned 100% of W&amp;K which supposed to have about a million of BTC from mining. Ira demanded to return these funds but it hasn’t been done.
7268,2019-06-29 04:53:12+00:00,KatieTheRussian,"5/ CSW promised big money to David’s family as part of his alleged ownership in W&amp;K, and tried to keep it not public when Ira required an explanation on money transfers from W&amp;K to CSW without notifying Kleiman’s family."
7269,2019-06-29 04:53:12+00:00,KatieTheRussian,"4/ TLDR of the pre-story. 
According to the story: CSW created Bitcoin. Short after that he started working together with David Kleiman. By August 2010 they mined a ton of coins. David started a UK company W&amp;K. David died in April 2013. Currently Ira Kleiman is David’s heir."
7270,2019-06-29 04:53:11+00:00,KatieTheRussian,"3/ From start CSW was playing a victim and a good guy that “respects the law.”   He cried a couple times, he mentioned having a master degree in law and getting PhD in it, he talked about religion and his soul."
7271,2019-06-29 04:53:11+00:00,KatieTheRussian,"2/ Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer, I am not a native English speaker, I am not an engineer. But I am deeply in love with crypto and our community. Here are the notes I took during cross-examination, put into one thread. I didn’t have access to Exhibits."

7283,2019-06-28 17:59:01+00:00,KatieTheRussian,CSW keeps not answering questions regarding the exhibits and respond with a question back. Playing with words a lot. The judge announced 5 minutes break and advices Craig's lawyer to talk to her client about the way he answers questions.

7533,2019-01-07 12:20:47+00:00,KatieTheRussian,So here I am in IAH airport still with my empty bag in my hands while my luggage is flying to Miami.
7534,2019-01-07 12:19:06+00:00,KatieTheRussian,@AmericanAir just didn’t let me onboard because I had an empty bag which they counted as an additional item. At the plane door I asked Flight Attendent to throw it away so I could get onboard. She said I’m misbehaving  and closed the door in front of me.
