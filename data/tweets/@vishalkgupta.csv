432,2021-11-04 19:14:34+00:00,vishalkgupta,"You can still trade IOTX on our USD and EUR books, currently in limit-only. We are evaluating options to provide traders sufficient supply of IOTX on the platform moving forward."
433,2021-11-04 19:14:33+00:00,vishalkgupta,"In order to protect traders in the immediate term, Coinbase is aggregating the supply of IOTX-E by pausing trading on our IOTX-USDT and IOTX-BTC books."
434,2021-11-04 19:14:33+00:00,vishalkgupta,"Users can still acquire the ERC-20 on Coinbase, but due to the supply/demand disparity, the price is higher than the native IOTX chain token on other exchanges.

435,2021-11-04 19:14:32+00:00,vishalkgupta,"Generally, conversion between chains is possible through bridges like ioTube. On 11/3, IOTX noted that the bridge has, for the first time, run out of IOTX-E to unlock."
436,2021-11-04 19:14:32+00:00,vishalkgupta,Coinbase provides support for the ERC-20 version of IOTX (IOTX-E) which has a more limited supply than the native IOTX chain. The limited supply of ERC-20s means that traders may not be able to acquire sufficient tokens to account for increased demand at market prices.
437,2021-11-04 19:14:31+00:00,vishalkgupta,We have paused trading on our IOTX-USDT and IOTX-BTC pairs due to price disparity compared to other exchange venues.
