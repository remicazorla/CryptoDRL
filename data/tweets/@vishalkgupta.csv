There was a very small but focused team behind the launch of $USDC.

435,2021-11-04 19:14:32+00:00,vishalkgupta,"Generally, conversion between chains is possible through bridges like ioTube. On 11/3, IOTX noted that the bridge has, for the first time, run out of IOTX-E to unlock."
436,2021-11-04 19:14:32+00:00,vishalkgupta,Coinbase provides support for the ERC-20 version of IOTX (IOTX-E) which has a more limited supply than the native IOTX chain. The limited supply of ERC-20s means that traders may not be able to acquire sufficient tokens to account for increased demand at market prices.
437,2021-11-04 19:14:31+00:00,vishalkgupta,We have paused trading on our IOTX-USDT and IOTX-BTC pairs due to price disparity compared to other exchange venues.

604,2021-06-26 16:07:05+00:00,vishalkgupta,@AdamSinger Centralized “stable-coin -crypto” markets are dominated by USDT. That would shift to USDC and/or BUSD. On DEX’s it would shift to USDC.

1570,2020-05-12 12:52:14+00:00,vishalkgupta,"@Chris_Colles @AdamSinger Very true. But going back to my point, it’s good to listen - but make your own decisions when investing."
1571,2020-05-12 12:51:15+00:00,vishalkgupta,"@AdamSinger @Chris_Colles It’s actually harder to deploy more capital vs less in the public markets. 
I wouldn’t listen to just any talking head, but I generally like to hear what him and other investors think (like Buffett), and create my own ideas/rules when I invest."
1572,2020-05-12 12:47:38+00:00,vishalkgupta,@Chris_Colles @AdamSinger He sold it and bought $AMZN. He’s doing ok.
1573,2020-05-12 12:30:26+00:00,vishalkgupta,@jillruthcarlson These same traders will eventually graduate to more advanced trading needs like options and lower margin rates. My gut is that @IBKR still wins the race for pro-sumer traders- no matter the generation.
1574,2020-05-12 12:24:20+00:00,vishalkgupta,NY dining done well during this craziness. Go support them!
1575,2020-05-12 12:20:11+00:00,vishalkgupta,@lawmaster This is BS. The FTX structured/leveraged products are pretty well documented.
1576,2020-05-11 20:58:01+00:00,vishalkgupta,"@AdamDraper 1. Identify the during/post covid trend that needs our focus.
2. Clearly articulate how our team is singularly able to solve that problem. 
3. Find the right people to listen to your plan as you build and GTM."
1577,2020-05-10 23:51:10+00:00,vishalkgupta,@levie It’s kinda both!
1578,2020-05-10 23:41:12+00:00,vishalkgupta,"You can’t have exchanges w/ disparate rules around leverage/liquidations, lack of best ex rules, huge leverage (100x) and an expectation that family offices/institutions are going to believe in $BTC as a reserve currency it should invest in. We need an SRO to come in with rules."
1579,2020-05-10 21:18:48+00:00,vishalkgupta,@katherineykwu LOL.. this is kinda beautiful https://t.co/aRCJ6BX8bD
1580,2020-05-10 18:53:44+00:00,vishalkgupta,@sampad @chamath This is a bold take and worth reading. Thanks again @chamath
1581,2020-05-10 15:02:08+00:00,vishalkgupta,This is the best @ColorWare switch I’ve ever seen.
1582,2020-05-10 15:00:36+00:00,vishalkgupta,Big props to the Alameda/FTX teams for creating great content and also being innovators in the space and actively trying to fix problems like these.
1583,2020-05-10 14:51:37+00:00,vishalkgupta,"Crypto’s obsession with over leveraged trading (100x) and exchanges with lazy then over aggressive liquiditation logic will only make BTC more volatile.. these structured products are akin to gambling, when in reality people that believe in BTC should just be buying and holding."

1586,2020-05-09 20:14:29+00:00,vishalkgupta,@MaxCRoser Here’s a good outline of what’s happening. https://t.co/2CFlviMOWq
1587,2020-05-09 20:06:34+00:00,vishalkgupta,I think we should all take a minute..this is going to be with us for a while.

1589,2020-05-09 17:26:17+00:00,vishalkgupta,"@MaxCRoser We’re gonna need to break out regions in the US to really understand what’s going on. Right now it’s the north East and everywhere else. We started as the epicenter, but thankfully tapering off- just as the rest of the country is making up the diff."

1591,2020-05-09 15:45:08+00:00,vishalkgupta,@AdamSinger I will say one of the biggest issues in crypto is no “best execution” meaning a broker has to execute the order and at the best prices- whether on their exchange or another. How it’s done in equity - https://t.co/qSQCBS96Wd

1597,2020-05-06 04:01:27+00:00,vishalkgupta,@serenabian1 Love to find out more and help where I can! Working on something in proptech that may help.
1598,2020-05-06 03:59:05+00:00,vishalkgupta,"@Mazzeo On example- EV’s/ Tesla vs ICE/oil co’s. 

Traditional automakers/dealers are falling apart, oil markets are dislocated, EV’s starting to take over in markets like Britain (even though total sales have fallen off a cliff- people want their EVs)."

We should open/close regions as we regulate the growth of the virus vs # of beds. For this wave and the next."

1615,2020-04-30 03:55:05+00:00,vishalkgupta,@chamath The same tricks that Robinhood used to make money while keeping trading “free” for consumers were available for all the brokers. Payment for orderflow was far from new.. Robinhood just decided that PFOF was really all they needed.
