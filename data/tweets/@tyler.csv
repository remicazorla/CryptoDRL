1,2023-02-17 16:49:30+00:00,tyler,"7/ This is a good step forward, however, further clarity and guidance is needed from regulators in order to help our industry emerge from crypto winter stronger than ever."
2,2023-02-17 16:49:30+00:00,tyler,6/ Investor protection is paramount to the continued growth of crypto markets. We appreciate this public rulemaking and Gemini will share additional thoughts during this process.
3,2023-02-17 16:49:29+00:00,tyler,"5/ Together, these compliance standards serve as independent verification that Gemini Trust Co.’s operations and security protocols meet the most robust standards."
4,2023-02-17 16:49:29+00:00,tyler,"4/ Gemini Trust Co. undergoes regular bank-like examinations, is subject to capital, BSA/AML, and cybersecurity requirements, and has achieved SOC 1 Type II and SOC 2 Type II certifications for its custody product."
5,2023-02-17 16:49:28+00:00,tyler,"3/ We recognize that the technology involved with digital assets presents unique considerations when it comes to custody. This is why we developed a best-in-class approach to custody, all of which has been crafted under the direct supervision and examination of the @NYDFS."
6,2023-02-17 16:49:28+00:00,tyler,"2/ Gemini Trust Company, LLC, is a New York trust company and has been a fiduciary and qualified custodian under the New York Banking Law since 2015. This will continue to be the case under any new SEC rule that comes into effect."
7,2023-02-17 16:49:27+00:00,tyler,1/ We are pleased to see that the @SECGov's proposed rulemaking on custody recognizes that @GeminiTrustCo is a qualified custodian.

9,2023-01-12 23:20:22+00:00,tyler,Thanks Dev! 👊
10,2023-01-12 23:10:02+00:00,tyler,"7/ Oh, and on a more positive note, bitcoin hit 19k today! Onward!"
11,2023-01-12 23:10:02+00:00,tyler,"6/ For the avoidance of doubt, Gemini has always worked hard to comply with all relevant laws and regulations. Any suggestion to the contrary is unsupported by the facts."
12,2023-01-12 23:10:02+00:00,tyler,"5/ But seriously, what is the point or urgency here? The Earn program has been shut down for almost two months."
13,2023-01-12 23:10:01+00:00,tyler,4/ We look forward to defending ourselves against this manufactured parking ticket. And we will make sure this doesn’t distract us from the important recovery work we are doing.
14,2023-01-12 23:10:01+00:00,tyler,"3/ Despite these ongoing conversations, the SEC chose to announce their lawsuit to the press before notifying us. Super lame. It’s unfortunate that they’re optimizing for political points instead of helping us advance the cause of 340,000 Earn users and other creditors."
15,2023-01-12 23:10:00+00:00,tyler,"2/ As a matter of background, the Earn program was regulated by the @NYDFS and we’ve been in discussions with the SEC about the Earn program for more than 17 months. They never raised the prospect of any enforcement action until AFTER Genesis paused withdrawals on November 16th."
16,2023-01-12 23:10:00+00:00,tyler,1/ It’s disappointing that the @SECGov chose to file an action today as @Gemini and other creditors are working hard together to recover funds. This action does nothing to further our efforts and help Earn users get their assets back. Their behavior is totally counterproductive.

-Relationship
(Requires High-Trust and limited to 15 people)

-Reliable Legal System
(Requires Medium-Trust and limited to your appetite to enforce in court)

-Blockchain
(Trustless and limitless)"
622,2021-12-11 20:40:23+00:00,tyler,"16/ Anyone, anywhere in the world with a connection to the internet can conduct and infinite amount of business on a blockchain."

624,2021-12-11 20:40:22+00:00,tyler,"14/ Enter blockchains. Blockchain transactions are backstopped by math (cryptography). They do not require building a relationship. They also do not require you to live in a jurisdiction with strong rule of law and a reliable legal system. 

These are Trustless transactions."
625,2021-12-11 20:40:22+00:00,tyler,"13/ This means you must build some amount of trust or rely on reputation (a trust relationship that someone else has built) to reliably conduct business in this system.

628,2021-12-11 20:40:20+00:00,tyler,10/ People who live in jurisdictions with a functional legal system are able to reliably conduct business with more than 15 people because such interactions are backstopped by a court of law.
629,2021-12-11 20:40:19+00:00,tyler,"9/ Arranged marriages have their origin in aligning families along political, property, &amp; economic lines. These relationships are backstops for business, peace, etc. Blood is thicker than water. 

But you can only have so many children and they can only be married so many times."
630,2021-12-11 20:40:19+00:00,tyler,"8/ Building trust with someone requires an investment of time over a long-enough period of time. There is a quantitative, qualitative, and longitudinal component to trust. It’s expensive to build and you have finite resources to build it (only 24hrs in a day)."
631,2021-12-11 20:40:18+00:00,tyler,"7/ Outside of the US, UK, and a few other jurisdictions, most countries do not have reliable legal systems. This means that most people in the world are limited to doing business with approximately 15 people."
632,2021-12-11 20:40:18+00:00,tyler,"6/ This means that you can only expect to reliably do business with about 15 people if your business transactions are backstopped by a relationship.

635,2021-12-11 20:40:16+00:00,tyler,3/ Not all business settlement mechanisms are equal. It's a continuum.
636,2021-12-11 20:40:16+00:00,tyler,2/ Business interactions require some sort of a settlement mechanism.
637,2021-12-11 20:40:15+00:00,tyler,"1/ Blockchains — decentralized and permissionless ones — will ultimately allow orders of magnitude more business to happen in the world.

It's made me better in my personal life and a much better leader in my professional life. And there's no upper bound on improvement. These skills never stop growing if u continue to put in the work.

4297,2019-12-31 16:28:18+00:00,tyler,Here’s to the 2020s...the future is you.
4298,2019-12-31 16:28:18+00:00,tyler,"Crypto will work because it is too fair to ignore; its gravitational pull, too strong to deny. When given the choice, you will choose more freedom, not less. And that’s why you, and everyone else, will choose crypto."
4299,2019-12-31 16:28:18+00:00,tyler,"Crypto will make as great of a contribution to your personal freedom as the invention of the printing press, the personal computer, and the early Internet."
4300,2019-12-31 16:28:18+00:00,tyler,"Within this decade, crypto will redesign the Internet, the financial system, and money in a way that fosters and protects the rights and dignity of the individual."
4301,2019-12-31 16:28:17+00:00,tyler,"Crypto makes decentralization possible, which is to say its raison d'etre and center of gravity is the empowerment of the individual."
4302,2019-12-31 16:28:17+00:00,tyler,"Today, crypto is still a niche technology and form of money. It is not crucial to your everyday life the way email and other web applications are, but our thesis is that this will change — it’s already changing if you look close enough."
4303,2019-12-31 16:28:17+00:00,tyler,"2019 has been a building year for both @Gemini and our industry. Despite a crypto winter that has persisted for more than two years, we have stayed focused on quietly laying the foundation for the next wave of use-cases and mainstream adoption."
4304,2019-12-31 16:28:17+00:00,tyler,"It’s been more than four years since we launched the @Gemini Spaceship into the great, beautiful unknown. While our voyage has covered much ground, it is just beginning. While our mission — to empower the individual through crypto — has accomplished much, it is far from over."
4305,2019-12-31 16:28:17+00:00,tyler,"As the sun sets on the last 10 years, which ushered in Bitcoin and crypto as we know it, it is with great pride that we look back on 2019 and with great excitement that we look forward to what’s to come."
4306,2019-12-31 16:28:16+00:00,tyler,"Today, we stand before the dawn of a new decade. As we look ahead, there is little doubt that the next one — the 2020s — will be ‘the decade of crypto.’"

5187,2019-03-08 21:04:53+00:00,tyler,"Last time I was at #SXSW, the year was 2016 and the price of bitcoin was $400. Today the price is $4,000 and all anyone can talk about is crypto winter. What winter?! https://t.co/VJe7nxpw6g"
5188,2019-03-07 22:39:25+00:00,tyler,Join Cameron @winklevoss and I tomorrow at @sxsw with @jolingkent as we discuss why we believe the #crypto winter will be a time of lasting innovation and progress for the industry as a whole #SXSW2019 https://t.co/VJe7nxpw6g https://t.co/6m8eW4vkct

5191,2019-02-03 14:50:25+00:00,tyler,"@_heyEthan that's awesome that you saw this so early. Like crypto, this was sitting right out in the open for many years yet invisible to most"
5192,2019-02-03 14:46:10+00:00,tyler,@_cryptoAK Thank you and will do! 👍🚀
5193,2019-02-03 14:41:51+00:00,tyler,@RrezonAbazi 👍🚀
5194,2019-02-03 06:04:36+00:00,tyler,@darren_mg @Twitch Lol
5195,2019-02-03 06:04:16+00:00,tyler,@Rococobasilisk2 @Twitch Well put
5196,2019-02-03 04:02:18+00:00,tyler,@CryptoVora @Twitch Just musing
5197,2019-02-03 04:00:29+00:00,tyler,@jaymiller73caca @IG_Galaxy @Twitch Lol.
5198,2019-02-03 04:00:11+00:00,tyler,"@saniakhan @Twitch Totally, like crypto it’s going to be fascinating to see it all develop"
5199,2019-02-03 00:26:54+00:00,tyler,"@gavinpotenza nope, not saying that or even addressing that argument, just remarking how it should be obvious that millions of people would want to watch other people play video games but for whatever reason it is not. I reckon I'd probably enjoy watching esports more than most other sports."
5200,2019-02-03 00:20:52+00:00,tyler,@_cryptoAK Perhaps the surprise comes from the fact that watching strangers play videos games is just as fun/more fun than watching your friends play them.
5201,2019-02-03 00:18:14+00:00,tyler,"@_cryptoAK true, but there is a more obvious physical/athletic component to your sport examples, whereas harder to see watching videos games, car racing, etc."
5202,2019-02-03 00:08:53+00:00,tyler,"This is just kibitzing amplified by the Internet, but for some reason it's not immediately obvious at first glance that this was always going to happen."
5203,2019-02-03 00:08:53+00:00,tyler,"When I find myself amazed at how many people watch others play video games via @twitch, I remind myself this is not a new behavior. People have been watching others play games (e.g., chess) for thousands of years. I remember watching my friends play video games as kid."
5204,2019-02-01 23:21:53+00:00,tyler,@jstorres @winklevoss Thanks for the kind words!
5205,2019-02-01 14:13:29+00:00,tyler,Good example of how hard it is for incumbents to change their DNA to compete with startups is to look at governments/countries. US Constitution (code) is completely open-source yet it proves extremely difficult for countries to copy + paste.
