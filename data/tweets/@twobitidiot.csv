+ Is the ""10 year"" DCG promissory note callable?
+ Where's the GBTC?

https://t.co/gnuOHDcgKn"
417,2022-12-11 12:52:17+00:00,twobitidiot,"6/ That brings me back to my point from last week. It seems like this resolution hinges on *where the GBTC shares are currently held.*

If spoken for at Genesis already, not great.

If at DCG, there's a path forward. Tricky, but doable.

https://t.co/sh4sCmG5EA"
418,2022-12-11 12:50:32+00:00,twobitidiot,"5/ This would make it much more likely that DCG has to pursue a recap vs. Genesis bankruptcy. DCG's odds in bankruptcy court plummet if the promissory note was, in fact, callable.

The lengthy silence could be a sign Genesis creditors are giving DCG time to figure it out."
419,2022-12-11 12:48:04+00:00,twobitidiot,"4/ This would ALSO reduce the urgency for Genesis creditors to force Genesis into bankruptcy through a notice of default.

The leverage would swing to Genesis creditors as it would be legally cleaner to pull DCG into the bankruptcy over a current asset than a ten year note."
420,2022-12-11 12:45:48+00:00,twobitidiot,"3/ It would also do two other things: 

+ significantly reduce DCG's ability to limit liability from a Genesis bankruptcy. a callable promissory note would basically be a ""you break it, you buy it"" situation
+ reduce Genesis's urgency to file bankruptcy as they ""have the assets"""
421,2022-12-11 12:43:07+00:00,twobitidiot,"2/ If true, Genesis could have treated the promissory note as a ""current asset"" (less than one year duration) even though it was structured as a ten year note.

638,2022-11-22 19:30:22+00:00,twobitidiot,"8/ This is highly recursive.

If creditors agree to Genesis resolution, then the DCG assets become more valuable.

That's because it's likely that DCG can raise outside capital if and only if Genesis liabilities are defined, limited, and contained."
639,2022-11-22 19:30:22+00:00,twobitidiot,"7/ If creditors can agree to terms, everyone has more liquidity today, less legal fees (maybe), shared damage.

+ Warrants in DCG / Grayscale"

642,2022-11-22 19:30:21+00:00,twobitidiot,"4/ DCG's health begins and ends with Genesis.

a) DCG negotiates resolution with Genesis creditors, everyone avoids bankruptcy, and DCG survives.

OR

b) Creditors reject deal, Genesis goes into bankruptcy, years of court battles, likely same (bad) result for DCG."
643,2022-11-22 19:30:21+00:00,twobitidiot,"3/ DCG - the parent co of Genesis - currently has debt in excess of assets and limited liquidity, BUT it also has Grayscale which produces $250-300mm / year in fees, and whose AUM is locked.

DCG holdco *should* be able to raise $$$ if it can limit Genesis Capital liabilities."
644,2022-11-22 19:30:20+00:00,twobitidiot,"2/ Genesis purportedly needs $500mm to $1bn in emergency financing or will face bankruptcy.

Some (exchanges) don‚Äôt want to make ‚Äúperfect‚Äù the enemy of the good, and think an imperfect bill is better than the status quo (roughly SBF‚Äôs view).

851,2022-11-04 15:11:55+00:00,twobitidiot,"11/ There are fault lines:

a) Politics: Is it possible to get a ""good bill"" done next year, or is the choice Dec '22 or 2025?

b) DeFi Rulemaking: Is DCCPA a net positive? Can DeFi survive rulemaking?

c) Oversight: Is CFTC vs SEC oversight even solved with this bill?"

Maybe it‚Äôs actually not that important. Or maybe it‚Äôs the difference between intranet and internet.

Ceding *any* ground on DeFi politically right before an imminent bank bailout v2 makes zero sense.

Crypto is a check on Wall Street bloat and an optimistic bet on the future, regardless of the short term criticisms."
1039,2022-10-01 17:23:06+00:00,twobitidiot,"Policy that would make the US the unrivaled leader in crypto:

+ CFTC-registered exchanges &amp; custodians; safeguards for DeFi
+ Stablecoin audit requirements and clarity on banking services
+ Safe harbors &amp; new disclosures frameworks for tokens, DAOs, and some NFTs

It‚Äôs possible!"

The tourists and scammers are mostly gone. Builders have taken back the conversation, and we can think long term again.

NFTs did that for consumers. What non-bs narratives will similarly sway policy makers?"
1047,2022-09-29 01:09:01+00:00,twobitidiot,"^ above is the primary problem with educating policy makers right now.

The early apps look like toys, junk, or worse to a skeptic‚Äôs eye. And we are losing the storytelling game today.

We have to nail the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù messaging and spark imagination or crypto will become fintech 2.0."

But if we can move the odds against him, we should as he's actually better pigeonholed at SEC.

The last thing crypto leaders should do is give him a policy win in Q4."

Investors and material token holders can abide by disclosure rules to prevent dumping, collusion, and punish self-dealing and mismanagement.
