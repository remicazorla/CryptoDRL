1822,2022-03-23 03:36:08+00:00,La__Cuen,"@SatoshiSarah @merklemerkel The reason Stacks exists predates the current model. This is not a criticism, merely a fact that it doesn’t serve Bitcoin. Bitcoin functions well without Stacks. Stacks does utilize Bitcoin. I think the term “programming layer” is confusing (misleading) for newbies."

1825,2022-03-23 02:50:08+00:00,La__Cuen,@Bitcoin_Bee It is definitely a strategy to use altcoins to earn value that can be stored using Bitcoin Core. Can you imagine if people called Ethereum a “programmable layer” of Bitcoin because of WBTC? 😏 https://t.co/gP2ycI2BN6

2033,2022-03-02 19:25:44+00:00,La__Cuen,@notgrubles That is true. Most people lose money. Ethereum cofounders did get rich. Very rich. 😵‍💫
2034,2022-03-02 17:38:55+00:00,La__Cuen,"@m__btc @notgrubles Pointing it out is fine, helpful even, as long as it doesn’t become obsessive. 🤔🙂"
2035,2022-03-02 17:02:21+00:00,La__Cuen,@heyellieday Yea if ETH fails &amp; I contact an expert they often tell me there’s a network issue. Fees can be $100! If BTC fails it’s 99% of the time my own user error. 😅
2036,2022-03-02 16:41:12+00:00,La__Cuen,"Pro tip for those who have a hard time w/apologies: Apologizing is brave. It’s also not a magical fix that undoes past wrongs. Rebuilding trust takes time &amp; consistent effort. But if you’re too cowardly for years, by the time you apologize the results will differ. https://t.co/qqEEROXXxi"

2039,2022-03-02 16:09:25+00:00,La__Cuen,"@heyellieday I don’t want to argue if you hold a different opinion. It’s my experience that ETH transactions can fail for a variety of reasons, that the tools are relatively insecure, &amp; that I am completely reliant on those service providers when I use it."
2040,2022-03-02 16:05:13+00:00,La__Cuen,"@emylacapra I think that’s healthy to be selective w/your time! I don’t see you ranting angrily about scammers for years on end, so don’t think my criticism applies to you. 🙂"
2041,2022-03-02 16:03:00+00:00,La__Cuen,This psychological difference is part of why ETH multisig tools have thousands of users but if you ask the 100 most bitcoin-savvy people in the world few of them have tried multisig. BTC isn’t a toy. It’s intimidating. I’ll write more about multisig experiments this spring. 🌱 https://t.co/IQ3EmXBgR9
2042,2022-03-02 15:56:06+00:00,La__Cuen,I’m horrified at myself w/how comfortable it feels to spend large quantities (for me) of ETH. I’d feel guilty spending $1K (USD) on makeup. That’s more than my rent! I felt no guilt  spending $800 in ETH on a jpeg. ETH doesn’t feel like money. It comes &amp; goes whimsically. 😵‍💫 https://t.co/Z6HLEkjYqB
2043,2022-03-02 15:52:38+00:00,La__Cuen,Then I realize it’s *much* easier to get ETH &amp; turn it into BTC than only earning BTC directly. ETH feels completely different. It’s unreliable &amp; there’s less pressure because it can evaporate w/out any recourse from service providers (Infura). It feels like fantasy. https://t.co/wDiPm7Deaa
2044,2022-03-02 15:47:30+00:00,La__Cuen,It changed my career goals.

2045,2022-03-02 15:45:01+00:00,La__Cuen,"When I started earning bitcoin as a significant percentage of my (modest) income, suddenly liquidating to buy makeup felt wasteful. I love makeup! It quickly changed how I perceive value. https://t.co/BMOTttNGqi"

2834,2021-12-28 04:04:47+00:00,La__Cuen,@vallard14 I think in this case someone has probably tried something similar before w/different tools &amp; contexts. I agree the fun of crypto is experimenting w/new combinations &amp; twists. 🤓

4184,2021-09-01 14:15:35+00:00,La__Cuen,@MrHodl I don’t mind admitting I’m wrong when I am. Am I wrong that a supply chain attack is possible? That recovery is tricky for newbies? 1 smart rebuttal said is that I can build my own hardware wallet for bitcoin. I liked that response! 🙂

4193,2021-09-01 13:24:12+00:00,La__Cuen,@str8edgeracer I know this! I just fear recovery &amp; don’t think anyone else in my family could manage it if something happened to me. Thus the anxiety &amp; desire for diverse devices. 🙂

5551,2021-04-04 13:39:52+00:00,La__Cuen,"@csuwildcat @BobMcElrath IMO, people rarely use better solutions. They use popular &amp; convenient solutions. I’m sure you know better than I what works technically. IDK if/when it would work socially. 🤔"
5552,2021-04-04 13:32:12+00:00,La__Cuen,"@ricburton Yes, this is also true regarding how people read text. They will literally imagine it says things it doesn’t if you present it in a certain way. (Like rage tweeting about it, for example, then people will not absorb the actual words &amp; will instead find only signs of malice.)"
5553,2021-04-04 13:25:20+00:00,La__Cuen,"@wasthatawolf @kallewoof Sure! The VCs also understood how important marketing was to spreading this tech. Part of it was just being welcoming to strangers, which, based on this conversation alone, is a challenge in an industry where people (rightfully) feel jaded. 🙂"
5554,2021-04-04 13:16:19+00:00,La__Cuen,@wasthatawolf @kallewoof (You’re correct some platforms &amp; wallets work w/bitcoin NFTs. I should have said there are far fewer &amp; they are less well-known.)
5555,2021-04-04 13:14:22+00:00,La__Cuen,@wasthatawolf @kallewoof Very cool! That’s a great example exception to the general rule. 🙂
5556,2021-04-04 12:33:23+00:00,La__Cuen,@BobMcElrath Which use case do you think has merit?
5557,2021-04-04 12:26:03+00:00,La__Cuen,"@kallewoof Technically nothing, but socially bitcoiners are less likely to spend bitcoin on play. Plus, there aren’t wallets &amp; platforms that are already compatible w/BTC NFTs. (The Ethereum NFT ecosystem grew products &amp; services for 4 years before this boom.) 🤔"
