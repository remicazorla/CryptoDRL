39,2022-12-09 14:52:32+00:00,CamiRusso,"Either:

1. Crypto will be traded/used in centralized entities that comply with all the same regulations as tradfi (so, it's just tradfi).

or 

2. Crypto will be traded/used in non-custodial, open protocols, which will need to be truly decentralized.

No in between.

 do literally create or ""print"" money"
621,2022-03-10 16:40:16+00:00,CamiRusso,@NotabylEth Not at this rate. Increased money supply without the demand to match it causes inflation (more money with the same amount of stuff causes prices of that stuff to rise). That’s just facts.

Also, this is not about companies “jacking up prices” this is about the US government printing money to fund trillions in spending. Prices increase as a result of that."

Rn most of it is on Ethereum, so we do have a lot of eth content, but we cover all other L1s too. If we took a proportion of where DeFi activity is and where our content is, and said 70% is on Eth, I think we are v balanced."

871,2022-01-13 00:35:59+00:00,CamiRusso,@aitche_ @EdPatisso I know she understands monetary policy. Which makes her tweet even worse.
872,2022-01-13 00:26:34+00:00,CamiRusso,"@aitche_ @EdPatisso I'm not tweeting about Kroger, I'm tweeting about politicians blaming supermarkets for inflation. 

I've seen where this goes: calls to control prices, which leads to empty shelves, which leads to supermarket workers losing their jobs."
873,2022-01-13 00:22:18+00:00,CamiRusso,"@aitche_ @EdPatisso Point is that prices are rising because of money printing, not because of some corporate conspiracy.

Workers having trouble making ends meet should be more concerned about fiscal and monetary policy; the root of the issue. Not about pushing CEOs for a raise; a patch solution."
874,2022-01-13 00:14:42+00:00,CamiRusso,"@aitche_ @EdPatisso It really is that simple. 

Sure workers have a right to strike. Don't think it's commendable that Warren is pushing this false narrative as she supports the strike."
875,2022-01-12 23:55:13+00:00,CamiRusso,"@aitche_ @EdPatisso $KR is not ""jacking up prices""

Inflation is accelerating in the US, which means prices in the entire economy are rising because of excessive money printing."
876,2022-01-12 23:28:01+00:00,CamiRusso,"If you pump trillions of dollars into an economy that doesn’t have the demand to actually produce stuff with that cash — it makes prices rise because there’s more dollars for the same amount of stuff. Shocking.

Or you can blame it on the supermarkets. 🙄"

894,2022-01-06 16:55:43+00:00,CamiRusso,"In the end, crypto is a risk asset, and while it's uncorrelated with other markets most of the time, corr will go to 1 when volatility spikes.

This time volatility is driven by the Fed rolling back crisis-era measures --because the crisis is over! That's a good thing.

906,2022-01-03 16:49:22+00:00,CamiRusso,@wfgIII I agree a president accusing media outlets of being fake news is extremely dangerous. I think both examples (Twitter censorship and the fake news meme) are signs of how respect of both free media and free speech is eroding.
907,2022-01-03 16:45:45+00:00,CamiRusso,"@wfgIII Today it's false info about covid. Tomorrow it may very well be something else. Twitter is in its right to do that, but my personal opinion is that it's disappointing to see that a platform used by 100s of millions can and will censor some users."
908,2022-01-03 15:59:18+00:00,CamiRusso,"@betherum1 I'm not an antivaxer. I'm fully vaccinated and wear a mask everywhere.

3013,2020-08-02 19:35:48+00:00,CamiRusso,"@zackvoell @coingecko I see your point. But also think that with so many tokens issued on ETH, and ETH being the main trading pair for most of them, it can influence the rest of the crypto market."

Otherwise, you'd arrive at very unlikely statements like ""WeShow Token"" or ""Demeter Chain"" are leading the rally (biggest gainers on @coingecko in 60d)"

That's ~10x more than internet users in 1995, 6 yrs after the World Wide Web was founded.

Ofc, Defi is far from serving those use cases well &amp; still used mainly for speculation."
