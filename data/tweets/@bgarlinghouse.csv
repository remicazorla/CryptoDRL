0,2023-02-15 20:21:59+00:00,bgarlinghouse,@MonicaLongSF Just take a look at our customer list üòâ https://t.co/dSaZq4gQEs
1,2023-02-09 21:51:01+00:00,bgarlinghouse,"The list goes on (Brazil‚Äôs new legislative framework etc) Note the commonalities ‚Äì these regulators are providing leadership and doing the work that we are desperately missing in the US ‚Äì unsurprisingly, this is where companies like Ripple are growing!"
2,2023-02-09 21:51:01+00:00,bgarlinghouse,"4/ South Korea‚Äôs Financial Services Commission published guidelines that delineate what would be considered a security token vs a payment token, and how those are separately governed."
3,2023-02-09 21:51:00+00:00,bgarlinghouse,"3/ the UK HMT‚Äôs new consultation reflects the government‚Äôs intent to establish a proportionate, clear framework that allows firms to innovate while maintaining financial stability ‚Äì an opp for the UK to become a global crypto hub (as it previously announced its goal was to be)."
4,2023-02-09 21:51:00+00:00,bgarlinghouse,2/ Australia‚Äôs Treasury is looking to reform licensing and custody for crypto and bolster consumer protection ‚Äì they recently published a token mapping consultation and are looking for public input before updating existing frameworks.
5,2023-02-09 21:51:00+00:00,bgarlinghouse,"1/ Continuing its history of being tech-forward, Dubai just published an extensive new set of tech-agnostic rulebooks for crypto market participants, covering compliance standards, advertising, issuance, and much more."
6,2023-02-09 21:50:59+00:00,bgarlinghouse,"Stepping back for a moment from what‚Äôs happening in the US ‚Äì just in the last few weeks, the number of positive (or at least headed in the direction of CLARITY) global regulatory developments is energizing!"
7,2023-01-27 14:45:31+00:00,bgarlinghouse,"There‚Äôs a lot I could say about how singularly impactful @MonicaLongSF has been to Ripple‚Äôs growth, for now, I‚Äôll just leave you with ‚Äì she is brilliant, strategic and has the ability to pick up and learn skills like no one I‚Äôve ever seen before. Congrats Monica!"
8,2023-01-18 17:15:47+00:00,bgarlinghouse,"My take on Davos 2023 ‚Äì I honestly think it‚Äôs healthy seeing the change in how crypto showed up this year. Folks are focusing on utility and how these technologies solve real problems -- the only way the industry will move forward. Great to catch up @ArjunKharpal, @CNBCJou!"
9,2023-01-18 07:34:43+00:00,bgarlinghouse,"I‚Äôm honored to join the European Commission‚Äôs Mairead McGuinness, UAE‚Äôs Omar Sultan Al Olama, the Netherlands‚Äô Klaas Knot and Bloomberg‚Äôs Stacy-Marie Ishmael at #WEF23 to discuss ‚ÄúFinding the Right Balance for Crypto‚Äù at 3pm CET tomorrow.
Tune in live: https://t.co/tZm2AAQ9w8"
10,2023-01-11 15:12:23+00:00,bgarlinghouse,"I know some may forget this fact from time to time, but as @s_alderoty so eloquently said, ‚ÄúThe SEC can only exercise the authority expressly granted to it by Congress.‚Äù Check out more in Stu‚Äôs op-ed below"
11,2023-01-03 19:09:54+00:00,bgarlinghouse,6/ The 118th Congress has a historic opportunity before it to ensure the US remains an innovation leader for decades to come. We hope it‚Äôs one they take.
12,2023-01-03 19:09:54+00:00,bgarlinghouse,"5/ Changing the status quo is never easy but I believe that the will to act exists. The building blocks for regulation have already been introduced, and we have a chance to get this right for millions of Americans who already are - and will continue to be - interested in crypto."
13,2023-01-03 19:09:53+00:00,bgarlinghouse,"4/ Singapore, the EU, Brazil, and Japan all have crypto frameworks - and the UK is well ahead of the US. But the lack of coordinated standards globally (or any in the US) continues to push business to countries w/ lower regulatory bars - w/ sometimes catastrophic results (FTX)."
14,2023-01-03 19:09:53+00:00,bgarlinghouse,3/ No bill is perfect and there likely never will be one that satisfies everyone. But perfect shouldn‚Äôt be the enemy of progress - these proposals provide more than a starting point for debate in this new Congress. The stakes couldn‚Äôt be higher.
15,2023-01-03 19:09:53+00:00,bgarlinghouse,2/ We‚Äôre not working with a blank slate. Prior bills have tried to address everything from stablecoins and CEXs (RFIA and DCEA); clearer definitions of what constitutes a digital asset security (Securities Clarity Act); safe harbors (Clarity for Digital Tokens Act) and more.
16,2023-01-03 19:09:53+00:00,bgarlinghouse,"1/ support for regulation is bipartisan &amp; bicameral. Leaders like @PatrickMcHenry, @CongressmanGT, @RepTomEmmer, @RitchieTorres, @RoKhanna, @SenStabenow, @JohnBoozman, @SenGillibrand, @SenLummis, @CoryBooker have publicly supported blockchain and recognized the need for clarity."
17,2023-01-03 19:09:52+00:00,bgarlinghouse,"Today is the first day of the 118th Congress. While prior efforts at regulatory clarity for crypto in the US have stalled, I am cautiously optimistic that 2023 is the year we will (finally!) see a breakthrough. A thread on why‚Ä¶"
18,2022-12-24 17:39:34+00:00,bgarlinghouse,@TaschaLabs I think you mean XRP !
19,2022-12-21 20:14:47+00:00,bgarlinghouse,"The world is (appropriately) outraged by SBF and FTX's fraud, but when Wells Fargo mismanages billions in customer funds as well, it's barely a blip on the radar. Food for thought.... https://t.co/uHnumn4Ryi"
20,2022-12-20 15:59:20+00:00,bgarlinghouse,"This 100%! 

It‚Äôs ridiculous and frankly shameful that Chair Gensler was touting the SEC‚Äôs enforcement actions as the ‚Äúcop on the beat,‚Äù yet (per public reports) MET with SBF multiple times, but was caught completely flat-footed when the alleged fraud finally came to light."
21,2022-12-06 16:48:27+00:00,bgarlinghouse,"Learned a few new fun facts about our inimitable @s_alderoty here myself! ( example: the man has put out BOTH literal and figurative fires üî•)

https://t.co/nt1VG7tC5W"
22,2022-12-02 22:22:52+00:00,bgarlinghouse,"I said it on day 1, we will aggressively fight to get clear rules for the entire industry in the U.S. 

Congrats to all of Team Ripple for getting us to this point. Ripple stood strong and withstood the SEC‚Äôs onslaught. I look forward to being on the right side of justice."
23,2022-12-02 17:35:21+00:00,bgarlinghouse,100% agreement with this @sheila_warren
24,2022-11-16 16:47:30+00:00,bgarlinghouse,"Despite some headwinds, I‚Äôm immensely proud of the @Ripple team who day in and day out focus on helping our customers move value around the world - whether remittances, individual payments, bulk funding, treasury management and more. #CryptoMeansBusiness"
25,2022-11-16 16:47:29+00:00,bgarlinghouse,"Announcements (part 2) with more to come
- Nearly 40 payout markets are live for ODL, representing 90% of FX markets

https://t.co/snACky5vSh"
26,2022-11-16 16:47:28+00:00,bgarlinghouse,"On a very positive note, we made some major announcements this week! (part 1)
- We‚Äôve processed $30B in payments on RippleNet (both fiat and crypto)
- We‚Äôre partnering with @MFS_Africa to bring ODL to Africa - our 6th continent!  
https://t.co/7FJkQJn7sT"
27,2022-11-16 16:47:28+00:00,bgarlinghouse,As I said on stage ‚Äì I firmly believe that crypto will be stronger because of this if we keep focusing on transparency and trust. Ripple has and will continue to lead in this regard.
28,2022-11-16 16:47:27+00:00,bgarlinghouse,"With all that‚Äôs happening in the past few weeks (and over the course of this year‚Äôs ups and downs), it feels even more imperative that we‚Äôve gathered together in person to have honest conversations about solving real world problems with crypto and blockchain."
29,2022-11-16 16:47:26+00:00,bgarlinghouse,"Our 6th annual #RippleSwell is underway! I took the stage this morning with @cnbcKaren to discuss all things Ripple, crypto utility, macroeconomic factors affecting crypto, and much more. A thread‚Ä¶ https://t.co/EDHW3nyka8"
30,2022-11-10 04:20:02+00:00,bgarlinghouse,"@brian_armstrong @SenWarren @SECGov Compare that with Singapore which has a licensing framework, token taxonomy laid out, and much more. They can appropriately regulate crypto b/c they've done the work to define what ‚Äúgood‚Äù looks like, and know all tokens aren‚Äôt securities (despite what Chair Gensler insists) 2/2"
31,2022-11-10 04:19:41+00:00,bgarlinghouse,"@brian_armstrong @SenWarren @SECGov @SenWarren, Brian is right -- to protect consumers, we need regulatory guidance for companies that ensures trust and transparency. There's a reason why most crypto trading is offshore - companies have 0 guidance on how to comply here in the US. 1/2"
32,2022-11-03 22:41:54+00:00,bgarlinghouse,"For those of you keeping count, 12 (!) amici briefs submitted.¬† It‚Äôs unprecedented (I‚Äôm told) to have this happen at this stage. They each explain - in their own unique way - the irreparable harm the¬†SEC will do to every facet of the US crypto economy if it gets its way."

36,2022-10-27 23:38:30+00:00,bgarlinghouse,"Below 50% - a huge milestone! For 10 years, Ripple has focused on using XRP &amp; the XRPL within our products for its speed, security and scalability for movement of value. As more customers use XRP in their payments flows, it‚Äôs clear there is real utility here."

We all should be outraged. 

The SEC has clearly forgotten that the government works for the people."
42,2022-10-15 15:35:44+00:00,bgarlinghouse,"@genelambo @cowboycrypto313 @BlackberryXRP My outrage has grown as the litigation has unfolded.  

There is no recourse, there is no consequence to those that brought this lawsuit.  The SEC‚Äôs pursuit of a policy objective isn‚Äôt about ‚Äúa faithful allegiance to the law‚Äù.  It‚Äôs about power."

Today, @Ripple is committing to be carbon neutral by 2030 AND building tools so any blockchain can use renewable energy."
273,2020-09-16 01:04:39+00:00,bgarlinghouse,"Disappointing to see India flip flop on crypto, hamstringing a nascent industry which could serve one of the biggest populations of unbanked/underbanked citizens."

276,2020-08-28 15:19:08+00:00,bgarlinghouse,The pandemic is throwing so many playbooks out the window... yesterday's action flies in the face of decades of precedent. Signs point to further dollar debasement in the near term (leading to further diversification of assets which will certainly be good for crypto).
277,2020-08-20 21:41:09+00:00,bgarlinghouse,"Thank you @TomEmmer and @DigitalChamber‚Äôs PAC for hosting today‚Äôs Crypto Town Hall (hopefully the first of many).

365,2019-07-17 23:58:31+00:00,bgarlinghouse,"This debate is healthy and necessary for the continued maturation of this industry. We need to ask and answer the tough questions, ensure our systems are battle tested, and have the proper oversight and regulations in place to protect consumers. 2/4"
366,2019-07-17 23:58:31+00:00,bgarlinghouse,"I‚Äôm heartened by the (largely) thoughtful dialogue from this week‚Äôs congressional hearings on @Libra_ . Committee members are supportive of blockchain and payments innovation in the U.S., but skeptical that Facebook is the right steward given the history of broken trust. 1/4"
367,2019-07-15 19:27:02+00:00,bgarlinghouse,"If not, we risk squashing innovation here in the US, and letting foreign interests take control of this new sector of our global economy. (7/7)"
368,2019-07-15 19:27:02+00:00,bgarlinghouse,"I hope there is no ‚Äúignoring, laughing or fighting‚Äù as it relates to regulation of crypto. If we want to maximize progress forward, it‚Äôs about working with the existing financial system - not against it. (6/7)"
369,2019-07-15 19:27:02+00:00,bgarlinghouse,"XRP is uniquely equipped to solve a multi trillion dollar problem by offering a dramatically faster and cheaper bridge for cross border payments. @Ripple already works with regulators, banks and financial institutions (like @MoneyGram) to implement this around the world. (5/7)"
370,2019-07-15 19:27:02+00:00,bgarlinghouse,When I read the Libra whitepaper - outlining a goal to create a new fiat currency - it was clear to me that the effort should be held to the same standard as other regulated financial institutions. (4/7)
371,2019-07-15 19:27:02+00:00,bgarlinghouse,"But as Mnuchin indicated, the entire crypto industry should not be painted with one broad brush - it has come a long way since the days of Silk Road. For the industry to succeed, we need to work with regulators and within policies. Full stop. (3/7)"
372,2019-07-15 19:27:01+00:00,bgarlinghouse,I agree that crypto isn't likely to replace fiat currencies - I have been very vocal that crypto isn‚Äôt likely to disrupt the US dollar and other G20 currencies in my lifetime. (2/7)
373,2019-07-15 19:27:01+00:00,bgarlinghouse,Just watched @stevenmnuchin1‚Äôs press conference on regulating crypto and have personally spoken to him on this topic. I‚Äôve also been ruminating on @realdonaldtrump‚Äôs tweets on crypto last week. (1/7)

377,2019-07-01 23:15:03+00:00,bgarlinghouse,"In 2015, long before the headlines and whitepapers, @AnaBotin identified digital-first companies as a threat to banks (as opposed to other banks.) So interesting to see who heeded her prediction and who is now scrambling to get with the times.

383,2019-05-21 16:57:20+00:00,bgarlinghouse,"Great to see @ecb come out with a clear POV on crypto assets - notably, that XRP is recognized as one of the most important in terms of usage, market cap and business model diversity."
