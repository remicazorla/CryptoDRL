I expect at least 50% discount for most of the assets on their book"

1906,2021-07-17 08:07:45+00:00,Arthur_0x,"13/ We know that currently, very few sizeable investors use this approach when it come to public market in crypto.

Without more market participants like this, insane market volatility will continue in crypto until this changes."
1907,2021-07-17 08:07:44+00:00,Arthur_0x,12/ At DeFiance we always practice more of a stock picker mentality when it come to public market and generally focus on allocating capital to the projects/protocols with good fundamentals that we think deserves it to make the market more efficient.
1908,2021-07-17 08:07:44+00:00,Arthur_0x,"11/ So almost inevitably, all VCs exit becomes dumping on retails until we  have a newer crop of institutional market participants that are active in the crypto public market."
1909,2021-07-17 08:07:44+00:00,Arthur_0x,"10/ Without mutual/passive funds in public market, the buying pressure of all VC unlocked bags almost 100% go to retails, with occasional trading in and out by the crypto hedge funds and prop trading firms.

However as we have seen, retails come and go with the market condition."
1910,2021-07-17 08:07:43+00:00,Arthur_0x,"9/ However currently, this category of market participants is almost non-existent, the closet we get to is @BitwiseInvest but they are still at early stage.

Crypto skipped a crucial step in the public market formation."
1911,2021-07-17 08:07:43+00:00,Arthur_0x,"Compare to retails, they also have a more rigourous investment process. 

This lead to more efficient capital allocation, which means more demand for good fundamental asset and less for vapourware who generally prey on retails' ignorance.

This also helps to smoothen volatility."
1912,2021-07-17 08:07:42+00:00,Arthur_0x,"8/ The major difference between mutual/passive index funds and VC is they are major participants in the public market by virtue of mandate, and unlikey hedge funds wont sell everything to get out with a hint of market stress."
1913,2021-07-17 08:07:42+00:00,Arthur_0x,"7/ In traditional market, it started with retails and gradually dominated by mutual funds and passive index funds. Hedge funds and VCs are a much more recent thing and only command significant market power from 2000s. The investing gurus of 80s and 90s are all public stock picker"
1914,2021-07-17 08:07:41+00:00,Arthur_0x,"6/ This cycle we have new entrants, the fabled institutions have finally arrived. But they have not venture beyond BTC and even for BTC, their involvement are sporadic in nature and often serve a catalyst for event driven trade."
1915,2021-07-17 08:07:41+00:00,Arthur_0x,"5/ Trading is also generally not their edge so buying from open market will also subject them to mark to market swings which is not comfortable to most VCs.

Even for growth stage stuff, buying from treasury at discount with lock-up is still preferred to buying from market."
1916,2021-07-17 08:07:41+00:00,Arthur_0x,"4/ Crypto VC is on the extreme end. Most are chasing 100x return, generally focus on private market where their perceived edge is stronger. Its also harder to justify charging 2/20 by buying something on open market. As a result there's always an incentive to fund 'xxx' killer"
1917,2021-07-17 08:07:40+00:00,Arthur_0x,"3/ crypto hedge funds by and large are trading the market trend and tend to exacerbate the momentum as well. Due to their liquid nature(LP redemption), they tend not to get into a position that is hard to get out. As as result most of their positions are short-term in nature."
1918,2021-07-17 08:07:40+00:00,Arthur_0x,"2/ Most retails don't do much due diligence when it comes to crypto investing(or is it punting?) as shown time and time again, lured easily to buying memecoins with low unit bias. 

Which is why we see stuff that have not deliver still trading at top 10 mcap (ADA, XRP etc)."
1919,2021-07-17 08:07:40+00:00,Arthur_0x,"1/ Currently there is 4 broad category of market participants in crypto: retails, crypto hedge funds, crypto VC, institutions (Microstrategy etc)

2908,2020-11-18 10:13:20+00:00,Arthur_0x,2. Transparency: Users can know the rate and availability of assets to be borrowed in real-time and take advantage of market conditions. DeFi borrowings rate are lower than CeFi now on fully collateralized term. Also less risk of credit risk like Cred incidence.
2909,2020-11-18 10:13:19+00:00,Arthur_0x,"Pros of DeFi vs CeFi lending &amp; borrowing platforms. 

1. Duration flexibility: Counterparty get quite annoyed/pissed if you pull/recall your deposits/loans within short amount of time despite it being on open term due to cost of originating a loan manually by highly paid banker."
2910,2020-11-18 10:13:19+00:00,Arthur_0x,I think the bigger take-away from this is DeFi lending &amp; borrowing protocols are able to compete head-on with centralized counterparts like Genesis Cap and BlockFi now even for the biggest trader in the space that move size despite some constraints.

6292,2019-04-19 06:12:03+00:00,Arthur_0x,"Additional piece of info after a chat with @DeribitExchange team:

Deribit had never had socialised losses in 3 years of operation, where we see Bitcoin go from $400 to ~$20,000 and back to low $3000, this is due to their much friendlier way of auto liquidation mechanism."

6295,2019-04-19 04:10:46+00:00,Arthur_0x,"In short, when ETH have a bullish price action, the contango will get wider, currently June futures are trading at 9.9% annualised premium while Sep futures premium are trading at 7.6%. When spot ETH is trading above 180 weeks ago, both premium are above 20% on annualised basis"
6296,2019-04-19 04:08:09+00:00,Arthur_0x,"Currently ETH forward curve are dictated by the spot ETH and stablecoin lending/borrowing rate, when market is bullish, demand to borrow ETH decrease as most traders don't want to short anymore, thus making futures position more attractive to hold than a spot position."
6297,2019-04-19 04:05:26+00:00,Arthur_0x,"5/ If you're bullish on ETH, long on futures not only avoid positive funding, but also means effectively taking a long time spread position on ETH, this is the more effective way to capturing the full ETH upside should the bullish thesis materialised over the next 2 months"
6298,2019-04-19 04:00:57+00:00,Arthur_0x,"4/ However, the high IQ play is actually to express the long position through futures contract instead, currently there are June and Sep expiry contracts listed now. Traders don't pay funding on futures"
6299,2019-04-19 03:58:44+00:00,Arthur_0x,"3/ Bitmex ETHUSD perp contracts have an average of 0.27%/day positive funding rate over the last 2 week(long pay shorts), this eats into the ETH bulls' profit significantly especially on a leveraged position, this compare with @DeribitExchange where funding are much lesser"
6300,2019-04-19 03:53:01+00:00,Arthur_0x,"2/ Deribit ETH futures allows you to margin trade ETH perpetuals or futures contracts with ETH up to 50x leverage, this is unlike Bitmex ETHUSD quanto contracts where your margin and PnL are both BTC, adding complexity if you want to overweight ETH in your portfolio"

6891,2019-01-16 14:22:07+00:00,Arthur_0x,"@ShrimpCapital @BitPay LN wouldn't fail, the adoption should grow but widespread use of crypto as a MOE is simply not possible without a stablecoin."
6892,2019-01-16 14:19:05+00:00,Arthur_0x,"@majinsayan seems like we might bart up anytime soon, bear can't even break through support on lower timeframe ."
6893,2019-01-16 13:00:47+00:00,Arthur_0x,@majinsayan You think one more down Bart is likely? Seems like the bazooka is ready to blast off anytime soon.
6894,2019-01-16 12:34:06+00:00,Arthur_0x,"@majinsayan Yes sir, but not enough"
6895,2019-01-16 06:49:54+00:00,Arthur_0x,"@zhusu The most popular index for local market $STI tells a complete different story through, what's with the disparity?"
6896,2019-01-16 04:30:12+00:00,Arthur_0x,@DegenSpartan Well I think he shouldn't support a scam project which is why I'm calling him out on it.
6897,2019-01-16 04:18:53+00:00,Arthur_0x,Crypto payment will not take off without a widespread stablecoin solution like what @synthetix_io is offering.
6898,2019-01-16 04:14:35+00:00,Arthur_0x,"For any merchants using Bitpay, the BTC was converted to fiat immediately for them. So while merchants accept BTC they only see the fiat after the conversion cost."
6899,2019-01-16 04:13:34+00:00,Arthur_0x,I like many visions the crypto pioneers have bring and spread to the world but goodness sometimes they are just in their own echo chamber and circle jerk each other.
6900,2019-01-16 03:18:15+00:00,Arthur_0x,"@DegenSpartan Also for the right morale, when it's a violation of some obvious one it deserved to be called out. Sometimes we let them go too easily. Also when you are the top exchange in the space, naturally you are held to higher standard."
6901,2019-01-16 03:15:42+00:00,Arthur_0x,@DegenSpartan Which morales are the right one he should subscribe to? That comes down to his own. Probably CZ think in same way like you that it's perfectly moral to allow scam projects to list on Binance which is why they had a track record of doing so.
6902,2019-01-16 03:14:10+00:00,Arthur_0x,"@DegenSpartan Hate to bring this up, but the way I think is even if Facebook couldn't stop childporn from being created, they shouldn't allow childporn in its platform, plain and simple. A company dont have a moral obligation but the founder/CEO do, and it's his call to make."
6903,2019-01-16 02:54:30+00:00,Arthur_0x,"@majinsayan The dump this time is quite mild compare to previous one, signs of bear losing momentum."
6904,2019-01-16 02:34:59+00:00,Arthur_0x,"@DegenSpartan And free market doesn't always solve itself though, there's many instances of market failure. Which is why regulation exist."
6905,2019-01-16 02:33:51+00:00,Arthur_0x,"@DegenSpartan Sure CZ can continue to support TRON and he's not doing something illegal, but it just reveal that he's a businessman that priorize commercial value over something else."
6906,2019-01-16 02:32:59+00:00,Arthur_0x,"@DegenSpartan It's not a slippery slope, it's more of a moral obligation of any exchange not to give scam projects more exposure than they should have.  Also your definition of censorship is too loosely defined here. Any business should have the right not to give support to fraud"
6907,2019-01-16 02:24:24+00:00,Arthur_0x,@DegenSpartan I don't think we should give platform for scam projects to even increase their exposure a single bit.
6908,2019-01-16 02:22:39+00:00,Arthur_0x,"@DegenSpartan There's so many better project out there that deserve Binance support though, what I mean is CZ is a businessman, don't need to overidolize him."
6909,2019-01-16 01:56:27+00:00,Arthur_0x,@DegenSpartan Arguably Binance plays a big role in helping TRX achieve such a big liquidity. Many whales exclusively trade alts on Binance. Also what's with supporting the BitTorrent ICO through their launchpad? He's giving a stage for him to perform another cash grab.
6910,2019-01-16 01:48:51+00:00,Arthur_0x,@Crypto_Macro @DappRadar Those numbers are even more insignificant compare to the active users. You can see most  active dapps are usually gambling related. Not much fun in visiting gambling dapps if you're not gambling right? Poker is another story.
6911,2019-01-16 01:46:10+00:00,Arthur_0x,"@DegenSpartan That said, I'm very sad to see him being so supportive of Justin Sun and his scammy approach."
6912,2019-01-16 01:44:59+00:00,Arthur_0x,"@Crypto_Macro Numbers available on @DappRadar, most have less than 10 thousand daily active users. It simply means none of the dapp have really achieve product market fit yet. My view is any dapps selling point shouldn't be it's decentralised and use blockchain as consumers don't care."
6913,2019-01-16 01:25:35+00:00,Arthur_0x,@Crypto_Macro What's the point of this tweet? Everyone know dApp have long way to go on UX before we can achieve widespread adoption.
6914,2019-01-16 01:20:14+00:00,Arthur_0x,LMAO at all the Bitcoin maximalist shilling Grin. Now you're on the same side with the VC yeah?
6915,2019-01-15 17:51:29+00:00,Arthur_0x,"@crypto_bobby Concur with the sentiment, most investor will prioritize liquidity over anything else in this market."
6916,2019-01-15 17:48:53+00:00,Arthur_0x,@Rewkang @cz_binance Seamless transfer of value through internet is the killer app here and there's still lot we can work on the UX side.
6917,2019-01-15 17:47:41+00:00,Arthur_0x,@Rewkang Growth of DEX vs CEX in crypto is a good example of this. A lot of people were critizing @cz_binance for the recent tweet where it might be safer to keep their crypto on secure exchange. This is likely to be true for most casual users.
6918,2019-01-15 12:19:33+00:00,Arthur_0x,Somehow the attack on Ethereum is intensifying these days. Signs of bottom?🤔 Fortunately we still have guys like @econoar and @sassal0x doing awesome informative work at @ethhub_io !
6919,2019-01-15 12:16:19+00:00,Arthur_0x,"Preston 'Marmot' Bryne is losing more credibility with his recent misinformed and forced attack on Ethereum. Pity, I really like a lot of things he said."

6936,2019-01-11 09:47:15+00:00,Arthur_0x,@Rewkang That's also my issue with most decentralised project that haven't achieve product market fit. There's no people driving the adoption and be accountable for it.

6946,2019-01-08 02:56:22+00:00,Arthur_0x,@DegenSpartan Yes by that you effectively created a Synthetic stablecoin. More likely OG or big whale who don't want to move their cold storage BTC doing it.

6958,2019-01-07 05:35:53+00:00,Arthur_0x,@DegenSpartan @ShrimpCapital @MakerDAO Meh I think that can be replaced without harming the functionality of entire MakerDAO stabilization mechanism. BitUSD don't have this feature.

2019 is likely to see all crypto adoption come from one of 3 motivations:  

1. Escape valve in uncertain monetary regimes 
2. BTC as a call-option on future SoV 
3. Believe in coming Web3.0 paradigm shift
