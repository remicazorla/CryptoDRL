21,2023-02-21 00:20:27+00:00,opensea,"@LooksRare The requirements are simply that you honor creator earnings for collections that have chosen on-chain enforcement. We hope you’ll join us.

Now, creators won’t have to make the false choice between receiving earnings on OpenSea or Blur."

And when we introduced the Operator Filter, it was our belief that on-chain enforcement was the best way for creators to secure their revenue stream from the ongoing resale of their work."
32,2023-02-17 20:36:36+00:00,opensea,"2/ Context: There’s been a massive shift in the NFT ecosystem. 

In October, we started to see meaningful volume and users move to NFT marketplaces that don’t fully enforce creator earnings. 

Today, that shift has accelerated dramatically despite our best efforts."

1120,2022-12-08 18:00:52+00:00,opensea,"18/ Lastly, in order to enforce a more consistent, on-chain standard for creator fees, we’ve amended the operator filter’s policies to require that contracts deployed after January 2nd implement EIP 2981 as their objective source of truth for creator fee preferences."
1121,2022-12-08 18:00:52+00:00,opensea,"17/ To that end, starting January 2nd, 2023, creators that opt out of on-chain creator fee enforcement will be able to set creator fees that are optional for collectors to comply with."
1122,2022-12-08 18:00:52+00:00,opensea,"16/ Additionally, we’ve heard compelling pushback from creators on the lack of an alternative mechanism for earning creator fees on OpenSea outside of leveraging our enforcement tool."
1123,2022-12-08 18:00:51+00:00,opensea,"15/ We heard the feedback loud and clear that this window of time was not sufficient, so we’ve extended the deadline for when new collections will be required to comply with the creator fee enforcement standard to January 2nd, 2023 across all EVM chains."
1124,2022-12-08 18:00:51+00:00,opensea,14/ Many creators leverage tools such as @manifoldxyz to deploy collections — and those tools needed more time to adjust to our new policy.
1125,2022-12-08 18:00:51+00:00,opensea,"13/ Initially, collections launched after November 8th were required to implement filtering of creator fee-evading marketplaces in order to set enforced creator fees on OpenSea…"
1126,2022-12-08 18:00:50+00:00,opensea,"12/ As part of this change, we’ve made a few adjustments to OpenSea’s creator fees policy to accommodate feedback we’ve heard over the past month. More on that below ⬇️"

1129,2022-12-08 18:00:50+00:00,opensea,"9/ Our hope is that bringing the conversation into a more public and inclusive forum can reduce the thrash industry players have experienced, and can build more community buy-in for the space’s evolving standards around creator fees."
1130,2022-12-08 18:00:49+00:00,opensea,"8/ Our number one goal is to incentivize a shift in the industry back towards respecting creator fees universally — so that on-chain enforcement tools can become an option for some, but not a requirement for all."
1131,2022-12-08 18:00:49+00:00,opensea,"7/ This has been a very hard month for the community, and we acknowledge that at times the choices we made were hasty and unaccommodating to some creators’ needs. There are ultimately no perfect solutions to the industry’s drift away from respecting creator fees."

Soon, we’ll be expanding governance of the registry to include more stakeholders, including — critically — voices in the creator community."
1133,2022-12-08 18:00:48+00:00,opensea,"5/ The charter of CORI is to create a decentralized body tasked with:
- Open, transparent governance of the existing Operator Filter registry and the policies that surround it
- “Built in public” R&amp;D focused on improving mechanisms for creator fee enforcement in the future"
1134,2022-12-08 18:00:48+00:00,opensea,"4/ The tool is very much a v1, and we acknowledge that there are flaws that need to be addressed as we iterate further. 

Our first step towards a better v2 is to decentralize management and governance of the registry — initially, by granting control of it to CORI."
1135,2022-12-08 18:00:48+00:00,opensea,"3/ It’s an existential imperative for the space to preserve creator fees. Recently, OpenSea took a step intended to protect them by releasing an on-chain enforcement tool called the Operator Filter."
1136,2022-12-08 18:00:48+00:00,opensea,"2/ The revolutionary potential of creator fees has been under attack for months. Marketplaces that do not respect creator fees have been rapidly growing in prominence, and creators, in turn, have seen their effective creator fees severely diminished."
1137,2022-12-08 18:00:47+00:00,opensea,"Before Jan 2nd, OpenSea will transfer ownership of the Operator Filter Registry to a multi-sig controlled by a collective incl. @ourzora @manifoldxyz @foundation @superrare @niftygateway &amp; @opensea.

1542,2022-11-09 22:08:22+00:00,opensea,"13/ We will start open sourcing our data on creator fees in the upcoming weeks for everyone to use. In the meantime, we encourage you to check out @punk9059’s tweets on this topic."
1543,2022-11-09 22:08:22+00:00,opensea,"12/ In short, we’re at a collective inflection point: if everyone left in this ecosystem who believes that creator fees are important to our future links arms on this, we WILL ensure that fees are durable."

1550,2022-11-09 22:08:20+00:00,opensea,"7/ Unless something changes soon, this space is trending toward significantly fewer fees paid to creators. No policy that we implement will reverse this trend if this behavior continues."
1551,2022-11-09 22:08:19+00:00,opensea,"6/ Simply put, in the last week, almost half of the creator fees set by the top 20 collections were ignored. This amounts to well over $1M for creators left on the table."
1552,2022-11-09 22:08:19+00:00,opensea,"5/ This isn’t theoretical, it’s happening now, and the trend is accelerating. Here’s the data: https://t.co/Tzi4QPd9dc"
1553,2022-11-09 22:08:19+00:00,opensea,"4/ For collectors, this means NFTs they really want are increasingly likely to be listed on marketplaces that don't enforce creator fees. Even if these collectors *say* they want to pay creator fees, they're becoming more and more prone to buying on those marketplaces."
1554,2022-11-09 22:08:19+00:00,opensea,"3/ One observation: in the economic downturn, many of those looking to sell their NFTs are trying to sell them for as much as they can. Moving their listings to marketplaces that don’t enforce fees is one way to do this."
1555,2022-11-09 22:08:18+00:00,opensea,"2/ When we began seeking guidance from our community, it was to understand a range of perspectives (from creators, collectors, and builders in this space) that would help us make sense of trends and behaviors we were observing."

1559,2022-11-07 23:49:15+00:00,opensea,2/ It’s become clear to us that we should continue to protect creator fees for collections created using our shared storefront. These fees will remain unchanged until at least 12/8 - the deadline we gave ourselves to come out with a firm stance.

1561,2022-11-07 20:27:45+00:00,opensea,We hope many creators will use our tool and others to take control of their business model. And we hope more marketplaces choose to enforce fees as a default in the future.
1562,2022-11-07 20:27:44+00:00,opensea,"Of course, creators can choose not to use any tool, and their items can be bought and sold on *any* marketplace - in those cases, however, OpenSea will not enforce their fees. We want to be super clear about this."
1563,2022-11-07 20:27:44+00:00,opensea,"Hey all! Something we want to be clear about: yes, we're building a tool that allows creators to enforce fees on chain but no one *has* to use it.

1564,2022-11-07 16:06:43+00:00,opensea,"For us our focus is on building tools that empower creators. We can't demand that other marketplaces invest in the protection of creator fees, but we can optimize our platform to serve as much of the community as possible."

1581,2022-11-06 00:55:10+00:00,opensea,"5/ We recognize this is a first step that addresses new collections, but we also know how important it is to think about alternatives to help existing collections navigate this new ecosystem dynamic."

1584,2022-11-06 00:55:09+00:00,opensea,"2/ It’s clear that many creators want the ability to enforce fees on-chain &amp; we believe that choice should be theirs–not a marketplace’s–to make.  

So we’re building tools we hope will balance the scales by putting more power in creators’ hands to control their business model."
1585,2022-11-06 00:55:08+00:00,opensea,"There’s been a lot of discussion over the past few months about business models for NFT creators &amp; whether creator fees (“royalties”) are viable.

2049,2022-10-20 16:00:11+00:00,opensea,"6/ We continue to believe creators should have autonomy, so they’ll of course be able to toggle off OpenRarity for their collections if they want.

We know that this is a big decision, so it’s important the community fully understands why we have so much faith in @openrarity."
2050,2022-10-20 16:00:10+00:00,opensea,"5/ As a result of this decision, we know that some collectors will see rarity rankings appear for their collections. But, we think increased awareness and continued adoption will be a net-positive &amp; reduce needless friction for buyers &amp; sellers."

2052,2022-10-20 16:00:10+00:00,opensea,"3/ To take a step back: when creators opted-in to @openrarity ranking, they tended to stay opted-in. To date, over 90% of collections remain opted-in.

With so much adoption already, it’s important now to build awareness and ensure that our community understands this methodology."
2053,2022-10-20 16:00:09+00:00,opensea,"2/ The most consistent feedback the OpenSea team has received around OpenRarity from creators is “how do I get access?” 
Many creators didn’t realize that this functionality exists and, as a result, we’ve had an inconsistent buying and selling experience across collections."

✅You can still use the @Metaplex Certified Collection (MCC) standard when you create your NFTs"

2920,2022-08-11 16:01:04+00:00,opensea,"4/ We know it's not perfect, but we came to the conclusion that the fairest approach is to change this policy on a go-forward basis only."
2921,2022-08-11 16:01:04+00:00,opensea,"3/ If we applied this retroactively, we'd be asking months or weeks later for them to take an additional step, when they'd (hopefully) put this behind them. They won't be looking out for the communication or prepared to take this additional step."
2922,2022-08-11 16:01:03+00:00,opensea,"2/ This is a fair question and we totally get it. We're not retroactively applying our updated approach, but hear us out: victims went through our old process and were told their item would be disabled from buying or selling."

Behind this blue boat is a group of humans who love this space like you do &amp; we wouldn't be here without you. More from us soon 💙"
2928,2022-08-10 22:02:26+00:00,opensea,12/ We care DEEPLY about enabling users to operate safely on our platform. Allowing the sale of stolen items and operating with stolen goods is no sign of a healthy ecosystem...but neither is a lack of trust from those of you who got us here.
2929,2022-08-10 22:02:25+00:00,opensea,"11/ Take @MetaMask: they’re already doing meaningful work to help make users aware of what they are signing:  

https://t.co/D1z2um8vEL"
2930,2022-08-10 22:02:25+00:00,opensea,"10/ Beyond that, we are collaborating closely with ecosystem partners to help prevent and disincentivize theft, and building better education resources to help users stay safe in web3."
2931,2022-08-10 22:02:25+00:00,opensea,"9/ In the long term, our key focus areas continue to be on finding solutions that tackle this problem at its root. Efforts are already underway to better automate threat and theft detection, such as blocking suspect URLs earlier."
2932,2022-08-10 22:02:24+00:00,opensea,"8/ 2nd, we’re making it easier for users who reported an item stolen to re-enable buying and selling when they recover the item OR determine they should withdraw their stolen item report. For example, we're finalizing details on a simplified process that doesn't require a notary."
2933,2022-08-10 22:02:24+00:00,opensea,"7/ For all reports going forward, if we don't receive a police report within 7 days, we’ll re-enable buying &amp; selling for the reported item. This change will help prevent false reports. We think this is a good 1st step &amp; we’re grateful for the community’s suggestions."
2934,2022-08-10 22:02:24+00:00,opensea,"6/ Based on your input, we’ve already made the call to adjust elements of how we implement our policy. 1st, we're expanding the ways we use police reports: we've always used them for escalated disputes, but they'll now be used to confirm all theft reports."
2935,2022-08-10 22:02:24+00:00,opensea,"5/ In some cases, the purchaser who unknowingly bought a stolen item (at no fault of their own) was inadvertently penalized. This is one of the most difficult issues we face. Please believe we take it seriously &amp; we’ve been actively listening to your feedback on how to tackle it"
2936,2022-08-10 22:02:23+00:00,opensea,4/ So why do we have this policy? It is against US law to knowingly allow the sale and transfer of stolen items. We do not want to incentivize theft by allowing our platform to be used to help sell stolen items.
2937,2022-08-10 22:02:23+00:00,opensea,"3/ We're in this together: as we work to make our users safer, it's on us to keep you in the know."
2938,2022-08-10 22:02:22+00:00,opensea,"2/ Our policy is designed to keep our community safe, but we know in some cases its side effects have damaged your trust in our platform. We’ve failed to proactively and transparently communicate the rationale behind our approach."
2939,2022-08-10 22:02:22+00:00,opensea,1/ Can we address the 🐘 in the room? We want to provide you more clarity and transparency around our stolen items policy ↯

2947,2022-08-09 22:17:19+00:00,opensea,"1/ A few months ago, we announced some big changes to our verification/badging process and an automated system to help identify, remove, and prevent copymints on OpenSea.
