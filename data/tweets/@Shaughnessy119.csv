223,2023-01-02 20:56:31+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"43/ One last prediction 

- Solana DeFi isn't dead. @aeyakovenko and Raj have built an ever improving chain that continue to get better (firedancer, jump building). It will take time to cleanup the Alameda driven VC Ethos (high vals, short unlocks) but they will persevere."
224,2023-01-02 20:56:31+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"42/ Are you a buildooor?

DM me a deck and I'll DM you a calendly link if we are interested"
225,2023-01-02 20:56:31+00:00,Shaughnessy119,41/ - Open to anything thats super interesting. I'm low IQ so this is all I can think of.
226,2023-01-02 20:56:31+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"40/ - MEV plays - but it will be hard to compete with Flashbots (Suave as a network of executors compete to return MEV back to users/user interfaces). 

- Controversial but open to regulatory DeFi type plays. 

- Any DeFi play with Exogenous cash flows or a path to get there"
227,2023-01-02 20:56:30+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"39/ @SeiNetwork is a recently funded example.

- Kind of DeFi but Opensea competitors. BLUR gaining momentum as a PRO version of OS and Sudo with the AMM avenue. Uniswap's NFT plans are a potential hurdle for both."
228,2023-01-02 20:56:30+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"38/ - Perpetual projects that advance on what we have today. Clear and massive PMF. 

- Structured products as retail gets access to higher deposit APYs and funds can seed  an options market.

- Excited about on-chain orderbooks given the issues with LP provisioning on AMMs."
229,2023-01-02 20:56:30+00:00,Shaughnessy119,37/ - Potentially a DeFi investment DAO (has to be a hub/spoke model with concentrated decision making in each sub dao or it doesn't scale nor is it efficient - i.e. voting on plays becomes a crowd and risk taking is shunned)
230,2023-01-02 20:56:30+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"36/ - Projects advancing undercollateralized lending in a novel way that incorporates blockchain's tenants

- Advances in stablecoins, but I think USDC may just win at this point (tether is historically too opaque)."
231,2023-01-02 20:56:29+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"35/ - Projects greatly advancing the UI/UX of DeFi (wallets may win on the DeFi browser side)

- AI is a buzzword but interested in any areas of AI advancing the most complicated aspects of DeFi (smart contract auditing, LP provisioning, risk analysis, economic modeling etc)"
232,2023-01-02 20:56:29+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"34/ - Projects lowering the hurdles of self custody 

- Projects recreating the FTX/Binance experience on-chain 

- This is most likely funding individual projects (perps, options, etc) that are then aggregated together"
233,2023-01-02 20:56:29+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"33/ Liquity and Rai are decentralized options. 

- NFT financialization. Need a really smart team to build out the finance side while offering something NFT holders ""Actually"" want to use. 

üü¢ In 2023 looking to DD and potentially fund"
234,2023-01-02 20:56:29+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"32/ - Lending and borrowing (Aave/Comp hard to displace, unless it's a step function improvement on undercollat borrowing)

- New AMMs on ETH (On ETH Uniswap has won. Interested in adjacent plays like LP provisioning etc). 

- Stablecoins. USDC has won for now."
235,2023-01-02 20:56:29+00:00,Shaughnessy119,31/ - Synthetic stock plays (too much regulatory risk and its not crypto native and I hate rebuilding what we already have. Rather go full crypto native vs having one foot in the old world.).
236,2023-01-02 20:56:28+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"30/ Too much risk vs building on established L1s or strong new L2s. Open to killer ideas.

- DeFi index plays (boring, need a lot of AUM to scale). Will let TradFi folks tackle."
237,2023-01-02 20:56:28+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"29/ - DeFi projects which are not materially different vs live and liquid versions (way less risk buying liquid DeFi tokens who have communities) 

- DeFi projects on less popular L1s outside of Ethereum (and L2s), Cosmos and Solana."
238,2023-01-02 20:56:28+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"28/ üîÆü•† Time for some projects/ideas I am not interested in funding in 2023 and those I am interested in

(I'll probably be wrong on a lot since I'm human but I'd rather be in the ring vs in the crowd watching)

üî¥ In 2023 not too interested in funding"
239,2023-01-02 20:56:28+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"27/ Ve Dynamics have their issues, but it is an improvement over normal staking. I think it is becoming copy pastish for a lot of projects scrambling for a token use case."
240,2023-01-02 20:56:27+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"26/ Since only vlCVX had gauge control, it offered outsized control (1 vlCVX controlling 5 veCRV), bidding up the price of CVX in the process

Convex's lead became virtuous over curve as Convex offered incentive separation.

Convex offered yield with no lock or outsized gov power"
241,2023-01-02 20:56:27+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"25/ Convex allowed users to 

- Stake CRV for cvxCRV for liquid token + fee gen (convex locks up CRV for veCRV)

- Stake CVX for vlCVX to control gauges (and CRV the cvxCRV people are locking up)"
242,2023-01-02 20:56:27+00:00,Shaughnessy119,24/ What happened is @ConvexFinance burst on the scene and allowed users to convert CRV to cvxCRV so they can earn the usual rewards while being liquid/unlocked
243,2023-01-02 20:56:27+00:00,Shaughnessy119,23/ This is important since if projects themselves accrue enough voting power they can direct emissions to their pools which juices yield instead of printing their own token to offer yield
244,2023-01-02 20:56:27+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"22/ Theme 7: Ditching veTokens

@CurveFinance championed the model. The longer you lock your governance tokens (2 weeks to 4 years) the more voting power you get and you earn fees from swaps. 

More voting power = more control of CRV emissions to pools"
245,2023-01-02 20:56:26+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"21/ As wallets expand they should roll out their own Web3 browsers/UIs to navigate DeFi/Web3 from within that space vs visiting a site and then having your wallet pop-up.

Functional wallet browsers would be nice via Metamask, @phantom, @xdefi_wallet  (port co)"
246,2023-01-02 20:56:26+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"20/ Historically wallets have been hard to monetize 

@MetaMask added in fee swaps to monetize. Longer term maybe some MEV is returned to MM via Flashbots and Suave. 

I think wallets may enter a new era of emphasis if the teams execute the right way"
247,2023-01-02 20:56:26+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"19/ Theme 6: The Rebirth of UX Aggregators 

Given an ever growing list of DeFi apps, clean and expansive aggregators are an obvious need long term 

Existing front-pages of DeFi will expand integration wise (@zapper_fi,  @DeBankDeFi  are port cos) and in functionality."
248,2023-01-02 20:56:26+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"18/ Liquidity borrowers pay a funding rate to GammaSwap LPs, which results in a payoff structure that beats the vanilla LP position in all scenarios."""
249,2023-01-02 20:56:25+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"17/ @GammaSwapLabs is mentioned 

""Using GammaSwap, users can borrow an LP position and separate the tokens, gaining positive exposure to impermanent loss."
250,2023-01-02 20:56:25+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"16/ Beating impermanent loss is the focus and if this isn't achievable then orderbooks may reign supreme (for majors, amms probably win long tail)

Projects are iterating to give an improvement over IL."
251,2023-01-02 20:56:25+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"15/ https://t.co/h7KODfHuJr

Theme 5: Improving Passive LP products + Delta Neutrality

TLDR: You're probably losing money being an LP on a concentrated Uni V3 position unless you're a pros pro."
252,2023-01-02 20:56:25+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"14/ Probably a future thread, but the Gemini, Genesis, DCG debacle is going to be long and drawn out

It's devolved to legal battles

DCG's crown jewel (@Grayscale) has its future fee gen under pressure (lawsuits, Reg M) which hurts DCG's liquidity outlook"
253,2023-01-02 20:56:24+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"13/ #Genesis is relevant right now

- #DCG owes $1.7B to Genesis 
- Genesis owes $900m to Gemini Earn
- #Gemini Earn users can't withdraw 

If this was more on-chain, Gemini earn depositors may have had more insight into where the 6% stable yield was being generated and the risks"
254,2023-01-02 20:56:24+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"12/ I'm unsure if there is a golden unlock here, or moreso just a mixing of TradFi (centralized risk analysis and evaluation) and Crypto tenants (on-chain transparency and lend access) to achieve something better than very overcollateralized loans to enable more efficient markets"
255,2023-01-02 20:56:24+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"11/ Theme #4: Undercollateralized Money Markets

Undercollateralized MMs are necessary for the market makers of the world to operate (@wintermute_t) for efficient markets. Depositors get higher yield.

Crypto has overcollateralized loans (aave, compound), but we need undercollat"
256,2023-01-02 20:56:24+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"10/ The Binance experience on-chain will take 5-10 years of continual DeFi and L1/L2 improvements

God forbid anything happens to Binance (would kill crypto, not something I'd ever want to see), we need an on-chain alternative. 

My favorite case is a slow, continual DeFi shift"
257,2023-01-02 20:56:23+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"9/ Theme 3: 0-1 Speculation Primitives 

The people want a primitive that offers high leverage and ease of use

We have @dYdX (DV Port Co), @GMX_IO and other options available, but we are a long way from @binance level volumes and jurisdictional blocking / UIs are a headwind"
258,2023-01-02 20:56:23+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"8/ Throwing my VC hat on, it's also going to be difficult for DeFi founders to attract capital on ultra founder favorable terms (i.e. high vals, long vests) given investors can allocate to live DeFi projects with liquid tokens which carry less risk than launching a new project"
259,2023-01-02 20:56:23+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"7/ Theme 2: Blue Chips Rise 

It's obvious that stakeholders will flock to more established DeFi primitives (@Uniswap, @AaveAave etc) that have time-tested brands, higher TVL, well funded teams and stickier TVL at the cost of the more grassroots, experimental DeFi primitives."
260,2023-01-02 20:56:23+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"6/ What does this mean?

The arrow should point in the direction of recreating the FTX experience, on-chain. 

This means a sophisticated matching engine and a one-stop shop easy consumer experience (aggregate DeFi protocols)

DEX vs CEX marketshare demonstrates our success"
261,2023-01-02 20:56:22+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"5/ Theme 1: Loss of CEX trust is bullish DEXs

Given #FTX I couldn't agree more. 

CEX's will continue to exist especially for the majority of users and centralized frauds will reoccur in every industry

DeFi needs to continually iterate to steal marketshare from CEXs over time"
262,2023-01-02 20:56:22+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"4/ A few headwinds I would add in are:

- Regulatory uncertainty for founders launching DeFi tokens/projects

- Regulatory uncertainty for existing DeFi projects (Uniswap fee switch anyone)

- 2 year treasury bills are at 4.24% which act as a vacuum for risk asset/token vals."
263,2023-01-02 20:56:22+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"3/ The authors call out DeFi's growth headwinds

- DeFi products are speculation based
- Onboarding is difficult
- Retaining users is hard 
- Overall UX of the space is far from ideal"
264,2023-01-02 20:56:22+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"2/ Setting the stage, Decentralized Finance has gotten crushed in the bear market

Most blue chip DeFi tokens down 80-90% and the longer tail of tokens down more

What's hard to see in the price charts are the teams that just gave up or disbanded. This will take time to show up https://t.co/uHFGvQQgjH"

956,2022-09-11 18:45:17+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"20/ Labs believes there will be many specialized app chains at the base layer connected via trust-minimized bridges with a unified DeFi experience atop. 

Developers can customize, and users get the benefit of these specializations through a super app

957,2022-09-11 18:45:17+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"19/ - Large community of Devs with multiple teams working independently on core development.
- Sub-second block times are feasible"
958,2022-09-11 18:45:17+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"18/ Why Cosmos

- Cosmos SDK makes it easy to deploy chains
- IBC allows for cross-state machine communication 
- IBC's trust assumptions are a big advantage
- Interchain accounts simplifies UX as you can control accounts on other chains"
959,2022-09-11 18:45:17+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"17/ Cross-shard communication makes it hard for labs to deploy here

- Avax: Similar to cosmos with a novel consensus mech, but relatively centralized and cross-subnet functionality and infra tooling are in the early stages."
960,2022-09-11 18:45:16+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"16/ Sui/Aptos: Can offer high throughput/low latencies + move language is solid but early stage of tech/communities/TVL

- NEAR: Dynamic Sharding can be incredible with validators dynamically grouping txs based on stat analysis."
961,2022-09-11 18:45:16+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"15/ Solana: Incredible community, progress, dev experience, and TVL. Will continue improving on tech to reduce outages + Jump creating a new client (firedancer) improves val diversity."
962,2022-09-11 18:45:16+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"14/ - Polygon: Fast, great biz dev, high TVL and a lot of ZK work. Labs views the permissioned val set (and of bridge) as a risk. Should decentralize over time.

Other mono chains below, but mono focus conflicts with Labs' vision of a multi-chain future."
963,2022-09-11 18:45:16+00:00,Shaughnessy119,13/ - Polkadot: Labs views gov control over parachains as a risk. Adoption is early. Views work on XCMP (similar to IBC) as a unique advantage that took years of work.
964,2022-09-11 18:45:16+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"12/ - Celestia: Tech not ready, also possible endgame - decoupling execution from data  and just offering ordering/DA at base layer offers security for rollups/app chains in a scalable manner"
965,2022-09-11 18:45:15+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"11/ - Ethereum L1: Too expensive

- Rollups: Centralized Sequencer and withdrawal times. Sequencer should decentralize over time

- Zk Rollups: Tech too immature, but a likley possible endgame"
966,2022-09-11 18:45:15+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"10/ The second half of the post goes into all the nitty-gritty of reviewing each L1 and L2 against the design requirements and labs needs. 

I'll attempt some quick TLDR summaries. All communities are AMAZING, this is just _specifically_ why Labs can't build on each one now. https://t.co/HUYUyKdcIg"
967,2022-09-11 18:45:14+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"9/ What are the platform requirements?

- Speed (close to CEX)
- Ecosystem (integrate DeFi apps beyond the limited scope of CEX apps)
- Decentralization (non-custodial, permissionless, and censorship-resistant)
- Cross chain-interoperable, tech maturity, and code portability"
968,2022-09-11 18:45:13+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"8/ TLDR labs believes (copy/paste incoming) 

1 - DeFi applications will be bundled into an integrated experience
2 - The world is increasingly multi-chain
3 - DeFi apps should deploy natively on multiple chains via outposts 

This outpost talk reminds me of interstellar ‚ú® https://t.co/7Y3tmOD5cz"
969,2022-09-11 18:45:12+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"7/ Interestingly, this leads to a world of both vertical and horizontal scaling

Vertical scaling since each app-chain can vertically integrate the outposts and primitives it needs to be successful 

Horizontally scaling since liquidity is coordinated between DeFi outposts https://t.co/MWJPbZBUuv"
970,2022-09-11 18:45:10+00:00,Shaughnessy119,6/ This is critical for Labs' super-app vision. The team foresees a world in which the app layer is bundled (UI//UX) but the blockchain layer itself continues to fragment due to use cases that require varying customization at the base layer
971,2022-09-11 18:45:10+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"5/ Labs is looking at a third option:

Application instances are deployed on multiple chains as outposts but are connected by leveraging a coordination layer that drives communication and liquidity allocation between outposts.

https://t.co/ms1yoU4w2S"
972,2022-09-11 18:45:10+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"4/ With many app chains, composability is key. There are two ways now 

- Standalone deployments on each chain that don't communicate (Uniswap on multiple chains) w each other

-  One unified chain (Thorchain), but this limits synchronous composability with apps on other chains"
973,2022-09-11 18:45:10+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"3/ There are drawbacks to not deploying on a monolithic chain 

- Composability, low social overhead coordination, and rapid prototyping at the app layer.

The main cost is synchronous composability. Labs argue this is only needed for a few apps (DeFi mainly) and there are fixes https://t.co/WRLWArvGWW"
974,2022-09-11 18:45:08+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"2/ Delphi Labs expects a world of specialized blockchains 

- Lower/Predictable Resource Costs
- Customizability
- Sovereignty 

Examples for each 

- Competing apps don't drive up TX fees
- Edit Consensus model, security, runtime, meme pool
- Not beholden to an L1's gov choices https://t.co/AcgmKNkbrq"
975,2022-09-11 18:45:06+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"1/ Reread Delphi Labs' post on finding a new home and I had to share a few of my favorite parts.

- Price"
1049,2022-08-30 16:56:16+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"9/ Sizing up The Potential 

Ball argues that if the Metaverse is 10% of Digital by 2032, and Digital's share of the world economy grows from 20 to 25% during that time and world economy grows by 2.5%, the Metaverse could be worth $3.65T."
1050,2022-08-30 16:56:16+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"8/ Regulation

Ball proposes that regulation could force Apple/Google or others to unbundle (OS, app stores, payments, related services) and have to compete in each area. 

This seems like an obvious headwind for traditional players and a tailwind for Metaverse options"
1051,2022-08-30 16:56:16+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"7c/ The Crypto angle also offers much greater incentives for Developers (ownership upside is a given but no 30% fee and easier access to capital) and Users/Gamers (lend spare compute, bandwidth, reselling items etc)

Incentives drive the world"

Your answer is that it can be exchanged for HNT

The fact is the HNT to this DAO is low and the MOBILE granted to owners is cut many ways. 

So its partial + partial ownership of HNT"
1314,2022-06-28 22:01:55+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"@amirhaleem @tbr90 @jeb821 So back to the start, if HNT is the value token and MOBILE is not, why do people want to hold MOBILE? 

And why do people want to earn MOBILE when its split so many ways and only a percentage of HNT issuance is flowing to this DAO?

1316,2022-06-28 21:47:12+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"@tbr90 @jeb821 @amirhaleem The other issue is the small amount of HNT ownership the MOBILE has

1) Only a % of HNT issuance is flowing to MOBILE DAO. Rest to other DAOs.

2) 5G folks get split again as MOBILE goes to many holders

3) End result, people earn less MOBILE which has a claim over less HNT"

- EIP-4844 with monthly pruning

- Huge SSD requirement for state disappears: a key bottleneck to scaling today

In closing, people's attention spans are shot so founder's optimize for TLDRs, captivating passionate stories, no surprise deal terms and thoughtful interactions. 

Founders, you are also interviewing. It's a two way street. Pick and incentivize the right daos/funds"
2006,2022-03-20 21:08:24+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"/24 Tip 6)

Leave your audience with materials learn more on their own time (another reason for no 24 hour closes) and in their own learning style

Offer up a podcast or YouTube video you did, a white paper, tweet storms or medium posts."
2007,2022-03-20 21:08:24+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"/23 Tip 5)

No one wants a 30 min pitch on a 30 minute call 

You can tell people the meaning of life, they may tune out after 10 mins

Do a 5-10 minute pitch, then get everyone engaged. Answer questions. Get Into it. 

Be energetic, be passionate. If not why are you doing this?"
2008,2022-03-20 21:08:23+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"/21 Tip 3) 

Keep the pitch deck to 10-15 slides 

If you can't convince sophisticated investors in an abbreviated manner, you won't be able to sell the world.

2009,2022-03-20 21:08:23+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"/20 Tip 2) 

Always be professional

Tip 1)

Never dismiss an analyst or associate at a DAO/Fund. 

In next-gen funds, these people are specialists in certain areas and their opinions are well respected internally."
2011,2022-03-20 21:08:23+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"/18 On Tokenecon ü™ô

At the pre-seed/seed stage full token econ does not have to be fully fleshed out. 

The keys are the product, GTM, value prop, community and team. 

As long as a team didn't shotgun give away all of its tokens too early, optionality to optimize exists"
2012,2022-03-20 21:08:23+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"/17 A key item is that stakeholders want to know what you have done in the last week and quarter. 

The space moves too fast to wait to build until a funding round closes. 

What technical work have you completed, where are you with your deligence? Share it."
2013,2022-03-20 21:08:22+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"/16 On The Tech Stack üë©‚Äçüíª

Teams should have strong reasoning for why they are building on a certain L1 or L2 beyond ""they can give us money"" and ""the buzz is real""

Money is cheap and the buzz is short lived

If you're unsure and investigating that's fine, but be honest"
2014,2022-03-20 21:08:22+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"/15 Team allocations matter immensely. 

Make sure you have enough not just for your current team, but a plan and buckets to incentivize the next phase of killer talent you need. 

The %'s can scale down as the project grows in $ terms, but plan for it."
2015,2022-03-20 21:08:22+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"/14 On Allocations üíµ

Be very thoughtful on your token cap table

Giving everyone an allo gives an allo to no one

Don't expect a fund/dao to do the work with a $25-$50k check

Make sure you are getting what you need from a DAO, fund or angel, and they have an actual stake"
2016,2022-03-20 21:08:22+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"/13 Last on deal terms, know your exit. 

We are all building toward a community owned world where incentives allow anyone to build out a project and be rewarded 

If you mention an IPO on the phone, funds/DAOs will think you're calling in from 2002. 

An IPO rarely makes sense"

2020,2022-03-20 21:08:21+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"/9 On Deal Terms ‚úíÔ∏è

Don't surprise on the token valuation. If you're giving an equity valuation, tell them the percentage of tokens that equity entity is getting so the fund/dao can back into the real FDV

2021,2022-03-20 21:08:21+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"/8 One last pet peeve on investors, never tell someone that a fund has committed or is leading if they haven't agreed to, and agreed to let this be known publicly. 

If you get caught in a lie, click - the fund/dao is now again mentally checked out."
2022,2022-03-20 21:08:20+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"/7 Remember to be very selective on your investors. Passive capital is likely NGMI in my opinion as money is cheap.

Give a realistic timeline ‚åõÔ∏è"
2024,2022-03-20 21:08:20+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"/5 On Investors üí∞

Founders should have a reason to want a fund/DAO involved. They should have a clear idea on what specific value the fund/dao will bring their project and community

A team should have a clear understanding of any comps if they exist and their plans

Building in a vacuum comes off as ignorant if a founding team isn't aware a comp has a better strategy and is further ahead

2708,2022-01-17 23:22:00+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"13/ Helium is an important piece of infrastructure for the Web3 space - it offers the potential of a global 5G/IoT network that is community owned. 

With this potential comes risks and a lot of game theory to consider between Helium and wireless/wireline companies."
2709,2022-01-17 23:22:00+00:00,Shaughnessy119,12/ üí≠ A partnership with a wireless company would be great but we don‚Äôt think Helium needs a partnership to be successful in 5G.
2710,2022-01-17 23:22:00+00:00,Shaughnessy119,11/ üí≠ Wireless companies partnering with Helium makes the most sense since Helium can leverage untapped spectrum of wireless co‚Äôs and they get access in the home.

2712,2022-01-17 23:22:00+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"9/ We also share mitigants for each

The game theory is interesting:

üü° Congestion in the CBRS band that is publicly available (80MHZ of the 150MHZ in the band)
üü° Competition from cable/wireline providers (adding CBRS 5G antennas to your WIFI modem and competing with Helium)"
2714,2022-01-17 23:21:59+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"7/ Helium is graduating from a wireless startup to competing on the global 5G playing field. With this large potential comes risks and hurdles to solve. 

Within the post we detail what we view as the largest hurdles to overcome. Below are a few of the major ones"
2715,2022-01-17 23:21:59+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"6/ The U.S. carriers spent $150B on spectrum over the last ten years. 

Helium's 5G network will initially leverage free spectrum called the CBRS band, spending $0. 

The project can expand and potentially partner with carriers who have unused licensed spectrum too, such as @dish"
2716,2022-01-17 23:21:59+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"5/ Also, 5G nodes sit on rooftops and on utility equipment where it is far from the end user (Inside a home/business).

Helium offers a solution since those running nodes (already 500k) have access within the buildings and homes where 5G is needed most. https://t.co/2WMSOu31pj"
2717,2022-01-17 23:21:57+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"4/ Historically 5G was a challenge since the spectrum to support these promises doesn't travel very far nor does it do well in adverse weather or through foliage, etc."
2718,2022-01-17 23:21:57+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"3/ Helium is expanding to 5G, you see it in the news but it is a collection of wireless technologies to enable very high speeds (1Gbps) wirelessly, with very low latency and the ability to support a lot of devices."
2719,2022-01-17 23:21:57+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"2/ Helium's model made sense years ago since the project was completely inverting the traditional wireless

üì° $0 spent on spectrum by using free, semi-licensed spectrum 
üóº$0 paid to tower companies since nodes are inside people's homes
üí∞$0 capex since users purchase nodes"

2874,2021-12-28 01:32:11+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"38/ I expect most (in the future) to be on-chain with full community ownership and involvement. 
- To date, funds haven't embraced becoming DAOs given regulations but can make forward-looking changes internally for now."
2875,2021-12-28 01:32:11+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"37/ TLDR

- Jack's wrong since he is BTC focused and hasn't built DeFi/Web3 apps and hasn't worked with VCs who are. 
- Jacks wrong. W3 VCs are just community members like everyone else 
- W3 funds are still evolving."
2876,2021-12-28 01:32:10+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"36/ We are already seeing it, projects are enabling on-chain funds @SyndicateDAO, @enzymefinance, @BabylonFinance, and @spar_protocol and we have examples @VENTURE_DAO @TheLAOOfficial and historically ""The DAO"" that was clearly well ahead of its time."
2877,2021-12-28 01:32:10+00:00,Shaughnessy119,35/ Forward-looking funds are already working on these topics.
2878,2021-12-28 01:32:10+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"34/ ‚Ä¶coding, etc)

Why? Simple - crypto is community-driven and large funds that don't adapt won't be able to compete with the community at large. 5 people around a VC investment committee can't compete with the millions of minds globally."
2879,2021-12-28 01:32:10+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"33/ I am a believer that ""eventually"" all funds will seek to be on-chain clubs and more DAO-like in the future with easier access to buy in/redeem and the ability to effectively reward people for their specific work (sourcing, port co-work, etc) or value add (ops, legal,‚Ä¶"
2880,2021-12-28 01:32:10+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"32/ 3(c)(7) - requires that all LPs be qualified purchasers (i.e., have $5M+ in assets, which  is at odds with global entry for a DAO)"
2881,2021-12-28 01:32:09+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"31/ A typical DAO (large # of members, lack of KYC, etc.) would not be able to comply with the registration requirements and it's not clear that even a smart-contract-based traditional fund would be able to either."
2882,2021-12-28 01:32:09+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"30/ For an investment DAO, the reasons why these exemptions don‚Äôt work are

3(c)(1) - Works if you have 100 or fewer LPs (that‚Äôs an issue) and do not make a public offering of your partnership interests."
2883,2021-12-28 01:32:09+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"29/ Funds want to use these exemptions so that they can avoid ongoing disclosure, requirements around director activities, prohibitions on affiliated transactions, and trading activities such as short sales and derivatives trading. See more below.

https://t.co/KwWPbedSR9"
2884,2021-12-28 01:32:09+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"28/ ‚Ä¶multiple people would count toward that total). You could also try for a 3(c)(7) exemption, but that is for ‚Äúqualified purchasers‚Äù (the test is you are an institutional investor and/or much wealthier than an accredited investor)"
2885,2021-12-28 01:32:09+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"27/ Funds that do not take on passive capital usually rely on a 3(c)(1) exemption from the Investment Company Act, which entails not having more than 100 persons beneficially own a stake in the fund (this would involve a look through where an entity formed to invest and held by‚Ä¶"
2886,2021-12-28 01:32:08+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"26/ Second) 

Outside of investment advisor exemptions, funds need to also comply with investment company registration requirements or filing with the SEC. Most funds use 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7)."
2887,2021-12-28 01:32:08+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"25/ ‚Äú A 2017 study by the National Venture Capital Association estimated the annual compliance costs for ERAs to be around $60,000 versus $330,000 for RIAs.‚Äù

https://t.co/vlxtPiIB6W."
2888,2021-12-28 01:32:08+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"24/ I'd need 100 tweets to cover it all, but basically, the number of legal restrictions, operations requirements, and reporting are insurmountable for a decentralized fund to comply with. 

Here‚Äôs a quick data point on the cost difference (doesn't include all of the headaches)"
2889,2021-12-28 01:32:08+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"23/ Also, since most imagine crypto assets will be classified as securities, the VC exemption is just kicking the can down the road

If a fund becomes large enough and exemptions no longer work, they have to become a Registered Investment Advisor."
2890,2021-12-28 01:32:08+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"22/ Remember, if a DAO wanted to use one of these exemptions, that does not preclude them from complying with all of the rules still (KYC/AML, formation of GP and I-advisor entities, limitations on leverage, and redemption rights, and a laundry list of other items)."
2891,2021-12-28 01:32:07+00:00,Shaughnessy119,21/ Most crypto VC funds can not meet these requirements to be able to be an ERA (Exempt reporting advisor) and have to register right away with the government.
2892,2021-12-28 01:32:07+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"20/ First) 

VC funds that take on capital in the U.S. have to register with the SEC as investment advisors unless they meet certain exemptions private advisor (under $150m in assets) or VC exemption (20%+ of investments cant be in non-qualifying assets - aka not securities)"
2893,2021-12-28 01:32:07+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"19/ Why don't funds just open the doors and let anyone invest or redeem as they please in an open, web3 investment DAO structure? 

The TLDR is regulations (in the U.S.) makes it extremely hard to run a compliant and permissionless investment DAO."
2894,2021-12-28 01:32:07+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"18/ Currently, I view this as an internal process of expanding inclusion and incentives for sourcing and portfolio company work, where all members of the fund are active and there are no roles for passive investors."
2895,2021-12-28 01:32:07+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"17/ Regardless, perfection is a moving target and I think the best Web3 VCs will change a lot in the coming years, a few predictions below

First, these VC funds will become even more DAO-like!"
2896,2021-12-28 01:32:06+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"16/ In W3, VCs are stakeholders, just like everyone else, but let‚Äôs not forget that now their LPs can take active roles in supported projects too. W2 VC Fund LPs can't go onto Uber's discussion board and propose massive changes.

https://t.co/pI9TvU4RxB"
2897,2021-12-28 01:32:06+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"15/ These activities range from thinking through token econ and incentives, future products or use cases, active governance discussions, evangelizing a project, and much more."
2898,2021-12-28 01:32:06+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"14/ But in W3, to remain competitive, VCs also have to be active day-to-day members within a community, full stop."
2899,2021-12-28 01:32:06+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"13/ Back to VCs - In W2 + W3,  they have to provide all of the original value adds 

Including legal help (formation, deal docs), ops, hiring and talent retention, and all the way to being a therapist or long calls to chat about direction, vision, and solving internal conflicts"
2900,2021-12-28 01:32:05+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"12/ Ownership and the power to change in Web3 is earlier and open to everyone, respectively, vs Web2"
2901,2021-12-28 01:32:05+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"11/ W3 stakeholders (which may be capital allocators or retail) are way better off since

- Earlier ownership (revolutionary) and incentives vs buying stock post IPO 
- Anyone can propose changes on a governance forum, vs Web 2 VCs which have unique access to a company's board"
2902,2021-12-28 01:32:05+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"10/ In Web2, users don't even have access to vote with their wallet since they can only buy a stock at ridiculous valuations post IPO. 

Crypto stakeholders today get airdrops, can yield farm, and can take part in projects for ownership much, much earlier."
2903,2021-12-28 01:32:05+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"9/ In W3 apps (not L1s), the execution of changes may be semi-centralized today (multi-sigs, access to code, etc), but a community actually controls a project since they can vote with their wallets (sell the asset or gov votes) and their voices (discussions)."
2904,2021-12-28 01:32:05+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"8/ In well-structured projects, a VC doesn't control the direction of a project, the community does. A W3 VC can post a governance proposal, or an engaged college student in Mumbai can post their thoughts, both will be vetted by the community and valued on merit."
2905,2021-12-28 01:32:04+00:00,Shaughnessy119,7/ Each project lives and dies based on its community. If a project isn't listening or adapting to its community (community = users and owners are the same) then usage and capital flows away.
2906,2021-12-28 01:32:04+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"6/ Jack views VCs as controlling entities for projects, but this depends on the VC and the particular investment structure used. At its best, the space is a meritocracy and entirely community-driven."
2907,2021-12-28 01:32:04+00:00,Shaughnessy119,5/ Those VCs that are just capital allocators will get weeded out as time goes on since money is cheap and founders are looking for stakeholders to be dedicated community members.
2908,2021-12-28 01:32:04+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"4/ In W3, capital allocators and community members should be one and the same; there should be no dichotomy."
2909,2021-12-28 01:32:04+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"3/ I think his view of VCs is skewed since he hasn't actually spent time building or investing in DeFi/Web3 apps due to his rigid, and very culturally and economically costly, BTC maxi stance"
2910,2021-12-28 01:32:04+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"2/ IMO, Jack's worldview is predicated on a rigid structure of BTC as the final crypto and Web2 VCs which are very different from Web3 VCs"
2911,2021-12-28 01:32:03+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"1/ Web3 VCs are nothing like Web2 VCs. 

Web3 stakeholders are way better off vs Web2 too

3351,2021-11-15 23:18:41+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"This is just a short thread to cover the absolute genius that is going into Mars. 

Huge shoutout to @ZeMariaMacedo @lukedelphi @lex_node @YanLiberman and to the entire Delphi Labs team for their work on Mars as contributors"
3352,2021-11-15 23:18:40+00:00,Shaughnessy119,The goal of The Mars Risk Framework is to ensure the safety of the protocol but to also codify the addition of assets so the process does not lead to a political situation where assets are added based on their hype vs the specific risk parameters that should be in place.
3353,2021-11-15 23:18:40+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"From here a scorecard is created which leads to a final numeric score for each asset.

With a score, risk parameters (below) can be set

üî¥ Optimal utilization
üî¥ Exposure limit
üî¥Collateral types
üî¥ Kp (responsiveness to the market to changes in the interest rate)"
3354,2021-11-15 23:18:40+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"Each asset is scored for each risk category using metrics such as volatility and volume (market risk), time since launch and audits (Smart contract risk) and team and centralization (counterparty risk). This is not an exhaustive list"
3355,2021-11-15 23:18:39+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"The Risk framework involves assessing three main categories

üî¥ Market Risk: Measures the liquidity and volatility of the asset.
üî¥ Smart Contract Risk: Measures the riskiness of the asset at the technical layer.
üî¥ Counterparty Risk: Measures the centralization risk of the asset https://t.co/J8lmCx4Hr4"
3356,2021-11-15 23:18:38+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"Central to Mars is its Risk Framework

In other words, figuring out the riskiness of assets on the platform and setting risk parameters for those assets in a non-political and methodical way to ensure the sustainability of Mars."
3357,2021-11-15 23:18:38+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"In total 2.5% of MARS is earmarked for lockdrop participants, with more going to those who are more long-term aligned with the protocol given the boost on longer lockup periods."
3358,2021-11-15 23:18:38+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"UST lenders will earn xMars too

20% of fees go to treasury, insurance fund and xMars stakers"
3362,2021-11-15 23:18:33+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"Shifting to token econ, Mars can be staked for xMars which is equal to one unit of voting power. This gives the power to participate in governance (risk parameters, asset listings, treasury spend and more).

xMars holders receive a share of interest rate revenue"
3363,2021-11-15 23:18:33+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"If you set it to 69 degrees and it's 71 degrees inside, it will softly correct.

If for some reason it becomes 100 degrees in your house, the air conditioning will go into full fan speed at the lowest temperature to course correct. This is my understanding at least."
3364,2021-11-15 23:18:33+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"Mars uses a galaxy brain approach known as a PID controller for rates.

TLDR, the protocol is always calculating the difference between the desired utilization and actual utilization and continuously corrects.

Think about the air conditioning in your house. https://t.co/DMMHRNK2AP"
3365,2021-11-15 23:18:32+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"If users can earn an extremely high APR farming, the APR on a money market usually only hits an interest rate well below this yield so there is a mismatch given borrowers have less of a reason to pay back debts and the yield delta means depositors have less of a reason to supply"
3366,2021-11-15 23:18:31+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"On Mars, you can lend and borrow assets in a more efficient way due to a dynamic interest rate model based on control theory.

Interest rate models are usually linear or with a second slope for high utilization or curved. None of these react well to external market conditions https://t.co/7QnNqwPzjA"

3385,2021-11-14 19:52:48+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"Every founder reaches a point where getting to the next level means firing themselves partially as they delegate to others or decentralize to the community

Those who start to fire themselves win since they lean into the knowledge and time of others"
3386,2021-11-14 19:50:23+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"On calls look for teams that promote each other instead of just themselves  

Pronouns: Those who use ‚Äúwe‚Äù or ‚Äúour team‚Äù is building this vs ‚Äúwhat I have done‚Äù

3387,2021-11-14 19:45:25+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"Also, each founders‚Äô mutual respect and understanding of each other leads to a better quality of life since instead of policing each other they let each other be free to explore the growth ops they can crush

3906,2021-09-10 19:44:56+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"@erinbeess That's fair, I misspoke here. I should have said that generative art existed, but is now running wild given its interplay with public chains, and communities."

3908,2021-09-10 19:34:24+00:00,Shaughnessy119,@adampatel23 @Delphi_Digital @gen_dot_art Thanks adam and to @homershillson - Delphi is excited to be a part of the community
3909,2021-09-10 19:25:12+00:00,Shaughnessy119,Note: This is under Delphi's INFINFT Fund
3910,2021-09-10 19:23:02+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"12) If you‚Äôre an artist, consider applying and if you‚Äôre just interested check out their discord. Stay tuned for our podcast.

Disc. Delphi and its employees have exposure to https://t.co/SN5gM3wNLf. As always, this is NOT advice."
3911,2021-09-10 19:23:01+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"11) As always, the entire @Delphi_Digital team is excited, but also a shoutout to @CoalieBee and @aanshmehta for their work on https://t.co/X8Gxu0qEOm as well."
3912,2021-09-10 19:23:01+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"10) The membership models favors a long term community. No surprise drops or rush to act, you can build and be engaged for the long term as an artist, collector or as an interested party"
3913,2021-09-10 19:23:01+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"9) There are always risks. This is an early-stage community up against other strong communities. Also if the NFT space cools, artists aren't attracted or memberships get too high it could box out new members. Anyone can buy any dropped NFTs on the secondary market, prices vary."
3914,2021-09-10 19:23:01+00:00,Shaughnessy119,8) https://t.co/X8Gxu0qEOm is relatively new but the team has already built out core features such as rarity trackers on-site and a membership scanner to see if the membership you are buying has unminted NFTs of past drops.
3915,2021-09-10 19:23:00+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"7) There is a lot to do (build out the DAO, audits, steering committee meetings, rarity tools integrations, greater build-out of the generative art infra and the contracts themselves), but Delphi is excited to join the Steering Committee to help where we can."
3916,2021-09-10 19:23:00+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"6) Artists are applying right on Discord. One such applicant is @LucasTsWick, whose work is worth a look

https://t.co/2MuryXDw9F

Reminder there are two memberships at play to access Artists' drops"
3917,2021-09-10 19:23:00+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"5) Artists come to https://t.co/kOLIjv8tpg for some exclusivity and an existing community to purchase their art and to help promote their work

The attraction of artists is key. https://t.co/X8Gxu0qEOm needs to focus on attracting real collectors and artists, not flippers."
3918,2021-09-10 19:23:00+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"4) https://t.co/kOLIjv8tpg will live or die based on its community, which is over 7.5k strong on discord and full of active discussions on artist applications, minted art, the direction of the project, and more.

Global curation of art is the end goal"
3919,2021-09-10 19:22:59+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"3) The next artist up is @imnotminimal (by @okanuckun &amp; @orkhan_art), who dropped Caesium just this week for members.

""Caesium Standard is a multilayered interactive generative art project that blurs geometry, abstraction &amp; generative art.""

View: https://t.co/fVtMuWsBBn https://t.co/UaBGC5S3sI"
3920,2021-09-10 19:22:58+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"2) https://t.co/kOLIjv8tpg has already featured two artists.

First up is @artBoffin and his creation of clines. Alexander has also dropped work on Art Blocks and Superrare. 

5.5K NFTs are dropped per artist.

""Complexity arising from simple rules""

View: https://t.co/0iYnUQFmVS https://t.co/ZkrgsCB8Md"
3921,2021-09-10 19:22:55+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"1) Generative Art is a new form of NFT art, where the digital artists are coders or programmers using a keyboard as their paintbrush to create complex formulas to enable the creation of proveable unique art the second a user clicks mint.

It's safe to say we are fans"
3922,2021-09-10 19:22:55+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"At @Delphi_Digital we are proud to join @gen_dot_art's steering committee as Gold Members

https://t.co/kOLIjv8tpg is power a generative art community through a membership model to end gas wars while fostering community curation of artists and their work."

7025,2020-12-02 02:25:27+00:00,Shaughnessy119,Disclosure. I am long YFI and Delphi Ventures is long YFI.
7026,2020-12-02 02:25:27+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"Last, this is all moving incredibly fast and I can be totally wrong.

I think all of these projects will do well, and these partnerships will enable DeFi to offer wild new apps and use cases. 

I am being very specific that I think all projects will do fine, I just prefer YFI."
7027,2020-12-02 02:25:26+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"There will come a day when Yearn is unbundled. That's when you want to be on the lookout for buying subcomponent tokens. When a component becomes more attractive than Yearn. 

I.e. you want to go long AWS vs Amazon, or buy the internet piece of the cable triple play."
7028,2020-12-02 02:25:26+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"On the flip side, these ""acq"" governance tokens may offer asymmetric opportunities given their low market caps plugging into a beast. I would be on the lookout, but I think owning YFI offers a better R/R since the acq gov tokens have multi-faceted risk."
7029,2020-12-02 02:25:26+00:00,Shaughnessy119,I believe large traditional investors will enter the space and look at YFI as both the go-to DeFi blue-chip and as a DeFi index or proxy given it's DeFi ecosystem.
7030,2020-12-02 02:25:26+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"Why I would rather own YFI 

- YFI captures value as these projects help build outs its ecosystem

- Value cap to ""acq"" gov tokens is TBD, not clear over the long term, and Yearn isn't married to them. If they aren't used or swapped out for better tech later, even worse."
7031,2020-12-02 02:25:25+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"Take it to the extreme - Yearn is getting exclusive access to build out its ecosystem with these projects, without paying a cent, just any value that would flow to these partnerships' governance tokens. Strategists would have used these projects anyway."
7032,2020-12-02 02:25:25+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"Value accrual to any of these ""acquired"" tokens is not guaranteed, and far from set in stone. Also Yearn is not married to these projects, it can merge with others later. You have to play devil's advocate. 

Value cap is clearer for the tighter partnerships - i.e. Sushi."
7033,2020-12-02 02:25:25+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"Net, Yearn went from yield farming these projects' tokens to $0 to ""acquiring"" them for $0 - and amazing feat. 

Imagine being able to purchase shares in Google's search biz or google docs instead of just Google. These ""acquisitions"" enable just that"
7034,2020-12-02 02:25:25+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"Zooming out, I love how Yearn is moving the space forward. 

Smaller teams get Yearn's community, tools, developer mindshare, liquidity and the Yearn brand while Yearn gets exclusive access to these projects capabilities (swap, borrow/lend, insurance, strategies)"
7035,2020-12-02 02:25:25+00:00,Shaughnessy119,".@iearnfinance's mergers are fascinating

Bitcoin does this on a mega scale. Being valuable as money, not just a memento between partners 

/ End rant. Influenced by Explained on netflix"
10286,2019-12-01 21:03:21+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"Net, $BTC makes better use of the playbook De Beers used to drive up the price of diamonds

Code/social consensus solve the centralized issues of De Beers and a global base of users/marketers help drive global adoption. BTC is cheaply verified + also lab diamonds is a red flag"
10287,2019-12-01 21:03:21+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"6) Most of BTCs marketing is its price. 

Rally‚Äôs drive short term interest and long term price appreciation and longevity continues to attract mass appeal. It takes two seconds to check BTCs price, vs a while for diamonds"
10288,2019-12-01 21:03:21+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"5) Defining value is tricky, but BTC one ups diamonds 

Diamonds have way less resale value (get 25% back) vs BTC which is very liquid. 

Diamonds have the (costly) 4C system for value, whereas for BTC you easily know through a transparent ledger your BTC is the same as another"
10289,2019-12-01 21:03:20+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"4) De Beers ran with ‚Äú2 or 3 months salary‚Äù to purchase a diamond engagement ring

For BTC it‚Äôs vague, but the drive is to store ‚Äúsome‚Äù of your savings / holdings in BTC. 

If the finance industry broadly agrees on some % people should allocate to BTC, that‚Äôs obv bullish"
10290,2019-12-01 21:03:20+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"3) De Beers created demand through savy marketing in movies, Ad campaigns and tag lines ‚Äúa diamond is forever‚Äù

Bitcoin is auto marketed by a global community through viral memes ‚Äústack sats‚Äù and strong value drivers (search for yield, uncensorable, SoV etc)"
10291,2019-12-01 21:03:19+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"2) BTCs distribution isn‚Äôt limited, unlike the route De Beers took. 

I‚Äôd argue mass distribution helps BTCs positive feedback loop and drives global adoption, so I wouldn‚Äôt knock it"
10292,2019-12-01 21:03:19+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"1) BTC‚Äôs supply is 21M enforced through code and social consensus 

De Beers controls supply artificially, but supply is not transparent and no one knows their true holdings"

- Question comes back to immutability. This would clearly have to be changed to enact storage rent. No point screaming immutability if ETH dies.

(I agree with Lane here, skrehae renr should have been in place from the start but wasn‚Äôt)"

12803,2019-03-01 01:17:19+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"26) @danzuller clustered shards - do you see potential for Byzantine attacks here?

- attack vector is colluding validators 

- large pool of validators and verifiable random function helps

12804,2019-03-01 01:15:23+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"25) question on simulation work streams 

- in ETH 1x

- https://t.co/z1f3qQUyVL hands on with ETH 1x. They have a simulation framework (run simulations that tweak parameters, fire up nodes, and since they can change parameters they can test what happens)

- can then run testing"
12805,2019-03-01 01:13:18+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"24) what does eWASM mean in terms of calling off chain? Outside methods 

- web assembly is not ethereum specific. General purpose

- very strict sandbox mode (environment methods can be imported to reach back in)

- 25 ethereum environments today 

(Need a Dev here to explain)"
12806,2019-03-01 01:09:57+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"23) My question 

Are projects like @MakerDAO / @0xProject gearing up for Eth 2.0 or is there a point where they will decide to rewrite for Eth 2.0 or move to another blockchain 

- larger teams gearing up 

- ETH 1.0 isn‚Äôt going away 

- harder for smaller teams"
12807,2019-03-01 01:05:40+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"22) How will developers handle smart contract migrations to a sharded blockchain?

- not really sure. Need better parallel processing. Added complexities will affect everyone

12808,2019-03-01 01:02:28+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"21) Q/A

- some shards will be more expensive than others (apps etc)"
12809,2019-03-01 00:59:54+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"20) Q/A

- cross linking needs more ETH why?

Need more validators to include a cross link from every shard 

- why contract yanking?

No concept of load balancing in ETH.  Move contract to a free shard"

- 111 validators per committee 
- 113,664 validators at start 
- 3,637,246 ETH locked up to start 
- max annual validator rewards 4.2%
- this is to start"
12814,2019-03-01 00:52:11+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"15) phase 3 light clients 

- beyond 2021

- very much still in research 

- 10 posts on stateless clients several years away. 

- minimize on chain data"
12815,2019-03-01 00:50:49+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"14) phase 2

- repacle evm with eWASM 

- asynchronous cross shard transactions 

- contract yanking (migrating shards)

- ETH 2.0 becomes useful to average software developers 

- development will start this or next year. In research phase. Can happen in parallel with others"

- shuffling and randomness so there‚Äôs no collusion. Shared security pool 

- finalization from PoS - Casper FFG. Finalize blocks in time

- rewards and penalties calculated every epoch"
12819,2019-03-01 00:42:08+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"8) roadmap

- ETH 1x in parallel

ETH 2.0 phases:

- phase 0 beacon chain (PoS)

- phase 1 shard chains (sharding)

- Phase 2 shards‚Äô EVM (shard execution, smart contracts, eWASM, storage/state rent) 

- Phase 3 light clients (off chain state storage)"
12820,2019-03-01 00:39:50+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"7) scale

- Layer 2 sacrifices part of trilemma ( scale, decentralization, security) 

- can‚Äôt put all scale on layer 2

- later 2 is still limited by layer 1 in some cases"

@preston_vanloon of @prylabs 

- biggest problem is ethereum doesn‚Äôt scale

- TXs theoretically is 27 tx/s but very basic calls

- typical max is around 14 tx/s

- need higher throughout for global adoption

- very limited formal processes today 

- only have ERC standards and all core devs calls (Friday - live streamed? 

- there‚Äôs room for improvement 

- we need to focus also on marketing, branding and project management in Ethereum"
12824,2019-03-01 00:29:14+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"2) ETH 1x timeline 

- 2-3 hardforks to fix issues 

- 6-12 months per upgrade so 1.5 years minimum"
12825,2019-03-01 00:27:20+00:00,Shaughnessy119,"1) Lane Retting @lrettig 

ETH 1x

- Recognize ETH 1‚Äôs limitations, to keep it alive, without doing the same work as ETH 2

- If ETH‚Äôs storage growth is uncapped, it won‚Äôt run (only few nodes can work) and we won‚Äôt have the time to get to ETH 2. Need to bound state."

Since that would lower supply and make the issue worse?

That could be bad though (If ETH is falling and DAI above $1 it could trigger CDPs to be sold off on a spiral)

MKR can be autoprinted to buy DAI, maybe we need the ability to autoprint DAI

(Add some % of DAI to each CDP holders wallet? Prob a logistical issue)

P.s. this is probably wrong just an idea"
