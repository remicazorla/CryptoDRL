931,2023-01-03 05:14:06+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@_HEXiCAT_ Was this before they realized how serious it was? Or after?
932,2023-01-03 05:13:29+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@Danny_Zav Dang I love skyline chili
933,2023-01-03 05:13:08+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@SethRob17508337 Yea I get it. But no one is talking about fantasy football wishing they finished the game.
934,2023-01-03 05:10:45+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"@hunt_travis It is totally rational and expected for people to wonder what will happen to the game. Like are we supposed to just suspend belief that this game will be played at some point?

To ignore this fact is dumb. Are we supposed to just cancel the season?"
935,2023-01-03 05:07:50+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,I haven‚Äôt seen one person complaining about their fantasy team. Actually everyone I‚Äôve seen has said this exact same thing. Why the anger?
936,2023-01-03 05:01:34+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@BopsXRP Oh man that‚Äôs horrible. I remember that. Can‚Äôt believe they continued. Certainly wouldn‚Äôt happen today.
937,2023-01-03 05:01:01+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@hunt_travis Awesome. I hope you understand this is one of the most viral stories I‚Äôve ever seen on Twitter. So what you are saying is no one should talk about it.
938,2023-01-03 04:59:46+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"I think people don‚Äôt realize how much disagreements on Twitter just comes from difference in life outlook and philosophy.

939,2023-01-03 04:58:07+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@HadjPadjOptions Amen bro it‚Äôs fake outrage
940,2023-01-03 04:57:44+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,Josh Allen and Stefon Diggs are my two favorite NFL players right now. I think they are great humans above just being football players. This backs it up.

946,2023-01-03 04:16:11+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,Exactly. Great take from Shannon Sharpe here. Everyone is just living in this unprecedented moment.
947,2023-01-03 04:09:17+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@ChadBreedsmore The decision will literally have to be made within hours. It‚Äôs just factual. It sucks but it‚Äôs like trying to hand out someone‚Äôs belongings after they die. It‚Äôs sucks. It‚Äôs sad. There‚Äôs no good time to do it. But it HAS to be done. That‚Äôs his sentiment and it‚Äôs reality.
948,2023-01-03 04:05:38+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"@ChadBreedsmore That‚Äôs absolutely not true. If his mom tells me she thinks he is dead then I will take it seriously. If I‚Äôm paying attention to ransoms on social media then I‚Äôm doing it wrong at that moment. Plus I‚Äôm with the doctors so getting freshest information

You are making up a fantasy"
949,2023-01-03 04:02:12+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@ChadBreedsmore I would not be on Twitter. I would be going to where he is. Just like Hamlin‚Äôs mom. So this is kind of a lame take. You think I would be concerned about Twitter with my friends life hanging in the balance?

952,2023-01-03 03:59:07+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@McShills There is a difference between an opinion and a factual error
953,2023-01-03 03:58:17+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@cuzelis Low IQ take. There‚Äôs a difference between urging other people or a platform to cancel someone over an opinion and personally choosing not to engage.
954,2023-01-03 03:55:38+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,I have zero patience for people who want to cancel people for opinions. It‚Äôs never okay.
955,2023-01-03 03:54:58+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"@rj_cbc It‚Äôs stupid man. Skip is getting attacked for acknowledging how trivial it feels to make a decision on the game‚Ä¶ but it has to be made.

956,2023-01-03 03:53:14+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@ChadBreedsmore I disagree. He‚Äôs talking about the situation in the field and a team situation that will have to be solved within hours. He acknowledged it seems trivial‚Ä¶ but that doesn‚Äôt change the fact it has to be decided.

958,2023-01-03 03:45:02+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@EBRAATZ11 Yea normal football play

964,2023-01-03 03:37:43+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"@usafan19 Nope. I won‚Äôt do it. That‚Äôs me reacting live to what I‚Äôm watching at that moment. If you don‚Äôt like it go follow some boring people who are too scared to say what they are thinking.

The point was to pressure the NFL to cancel the game."

1243,2022-12-29 05:37:33+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@Scarcity_Mining No argument there. My point is many act like 21 million supply is important. And treat the number like it‚Äôs a barometer for what a coin supply should be. The chosen number of 21 million is irrelevant
1244,2022-12-29 05:35:20+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@leinilyu @NeilJacobs Yea I agree. What I meant was a mechanism to bring coins into circulation. The number of blocks per halving is also somewhat arbitrary. There is a little bit of a formula there tho based on max supply.

3116,2022-11-06 01:50:09+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@marshosaurus @GATZBY_ @elonmusk Well they have to keep paying per month. I believe a lot of the hacked verified accounts are less active accounts maybe dormant for a while. So most of those people would not continuing paying bc it‚Äôs monthly. The once verified always verified was much more favorable for hackers

3118,2022-11-06 01:38:15+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@xrpbreezy Missing the point. $8 is a better system with better protection so I‚Äôm happy about it.
3119,2022-11-06 01:34:15+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@rob_miller87 I mean some may be but I‚Äôm not. Intermediates were basically just people who knew an employee and could get it done. There weren‚Äôt companies or anything. I‚Äôve been talking about the slimy verification business for years. I guess no one was listening but glad they are now.
3120,2022-11-06 01:28:06+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@marshosaurus @GATZBY_ @elonmusk So each account at $8 will be one asset. Bot account are free to create &amp; get banned probably within 24 hours as they get reported. So it‚Äôs not 30 days for $8. It‚Äôs a few hours for $8. So for one continually active account it could cost $600 per month. It won‚Äôt be profitable 2/2
3121,2022-11-06 01:25:14+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@marshosaurus @GATZBY_ @elonmusk I don‚Äôt think you understand. When battling bots/impersonators the goal is to take away assets from them. For instance if get a WhatsApp number banned then every post with that number is now dead. So they just deploy much more effort to counter the loss of that asset 1/2

5242,2022-06-17 04:33:15+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"6/ The idea was to keep people from selling and theoretically it should make it more value by having longer and more committed holders‚Ä¶ especially in times of downside volatility. 
I'm actually suing a guy right now over false statements against me for this one."
5243,2022-06-17 04:33:14+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"5/ Once again, this project appealed to something specific 
It had something in the code that punished people for selling by paying a high percent."
5244,2022-06-17 04:33:14+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"4/ But there's like 19,000 of those or so. 
Now we move to probably most popular one to attack me for‚Ä¶ Pamp Network. I think I'm supposed to fight a hippo or something over this one.Pamp was the last anonymous team we ever worked with bc anons are red flags. period."
5245,2022-06-17 04:33:14+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"3/ It traded $126,000 in volume yesterday. Chart looks dead like almost all altcoins. 
But unless you can discover some inside info I don't have, I wouldn't confirm that one as an outright scam either. Maybe a dead project. Maybe a failed project."
5246,2022-06-17 04:33:14+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"2/ They were pissed at me for deleting it. 
Jury is still out on that one I believe. It had a lot of very distinguished &amp; reputable people on their team. But who knows maybe CEO scammed them to join. Sometimes it really can be one bad actor."
5247,2022-06-17 04:33:14+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"1/ Part VI 

So when they delayed the launch and we didn't receive our tokens, I didn't want other people to buy them based on the wrong information of launch date without the update. So I deleted it. Once again, trying to do the right thing."
5248,2022-06-17 04:31:50+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,25/ A newbie could see the video months later and somehow find the dead coin on an exchange and buy it. Doesn't sound like best practice imo. Next one is also misleading man. We had actually purchased Cypherium tokens ourselves.
5249,2022-06-17 04:31:50+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"24/ Website still up from rebrand: https://t.co/mMPFIYL7Ri I mean price has still seen better days but wasn't a scam. And deletion was personal. And I mean Zach, like do you think it's better to leave up a video? 
Seems counterintuitive to leave a video up."
5250,2022-06-17 04:31:50+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,23/ I deleted the video because I got into an argument with their CEO. I don't even remember what about tbh. He turned out to be a giant douche. But their website is gone‚Ä¶ BECAUSE THEY REBRANDED LMAO.
5251,2022-06-17 04:31:50+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"22/ That was in the end of 2020 and discussions around ETH Staking were hot and they had a super interesting model. Outside of DISTX, this was probably the most surprising one to me. 
Zach, I have to say your $LOCK claim was probably your laziest work of the year."
5252,2022-06-17 04:31:49+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"21/ CMC, the top coin research site in the world‚Ä¶ the number 1 most visited website in crypto... owned by the world's biggest crypto exchange Binance... signaled this was one they liked and were watching. 
It felt like a thumbs up to me. Felt very safe with this one."
5253,2022-06-17 04:31:49+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"20/ Of course no one ever held them accountable for pushing it. As always, only me."
5254,2022-06-17 04:31:49+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,19/ I like how Zach you only put me on the hook here. Cointelegraph published multiple articles about them. CoinMarketCap liked and retweeted their announcement tweet. The project seemed legit by our standards &amp; were heavily influenced by CT &amp; CMC.
5255,2022-06-17 04:31:49+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"17/ I don't think anyone else out there has ever done that. We accepted responsibility and moved on. In September that year, I tweeted an ad for a project called ZAO finance (supposed to support women - see how the scams appeal to something?) I think they paid us $100."
5256,2022-06-17 04:31:48+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"16/ I had gone so overboard in trusting this coin, that the right move here was to give back all of the sponsor money I received to the people DISTX scammed. We donated all our earnings to the DISTX holders by choice with no prompt or pressure. It was the right thing to do."
5257,2022-06-17 04:31:48+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,15/ Team put themselves out there and even talked for 30 minutes in an interview showing their faces as mentioned. This one hit me hard.
5258,2022-06-17 04:31:48+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"14/ They put my logo all over the website &amp; I thought it was a good fight for me to wage against rug pullers. 
I felt good about trying to do something. Later on, they would approach me about a sponsored video which we did. I thought there was no downside."
5259,2022-06-17 04:31:48+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"13/ Of course projects on their platform couldn't rug pull. 
But the platform itself could. The amount of depravity is unreal. No limits. Basically I agreed to cover the project as a PARTNER at first. Not in a sponsored capacity."
5260,2022-06-17 04:31:48+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"12/ So they once again preyed on the fact I wanted to protect 
my subscribers. Stupid me I fell hook, line, and sinker. Who would have thought the anti-scam coin would rug pull. Because they weren't trying to prevent scams‚Ä¶ they were trying to run one."
5261,2022-06-17 04:31:48+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"11/ I even had CEO on showing his face for an interview. 
The brazenness of some of these people‚Ä¶ I went hard on trusting this coin. You see, the team behind DISTX turns out to be one of the biggest serial scamming teams in crypto. They do this over and over and over again."
5262,2022-06-17 04:31:47+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"10/ That's the reality of the space. 
Fall of 2020: DISTX. This project was billed to me as the anti-scam platform. IMPOSSIBLE TO RUG PULL. And coming off the MYX disaster, I was really itching to fight the scammers so this one really did seem to be a solution."
5263,2022-06-17 04:31:47+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"9/ After this went south I contacted @LiteLiger and he showed me everything. 
We talked it out and it went pretty well. He has been on my research team ever since to this very day and has helped isolate bad parties many times. Say it with me: Projects PREYING on Influencers."
5264,2022-06-17 04:31:47+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"8/ That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard people say. It makes ZERO sense. 
Fall of 2020: MYX. I was warned about this by a guy named @LigerLite. But keep in mind almost every project has haters. It's hard to know sometimes what's FUD when the team seems so kind &amp; confident."
5265,2022-06-17 04:31:47+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"7/ I'm much more skeptical now. And besides, we don't need more coins. 
So let's go through probably the most difficult part of this. Projects we covered that turned out to be scams. This is the holy list of BitBoy hatred. I will reiterate: I NEVER knowingly promoted a scam."
5266,2022-06-17 04:31:47+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"6/ But just know picking them really is like the lottery. 
And those are things I wouldn't have agreed w/ at beginning of last bull run. Because I was na√Øve and believed too optimistically in the ability for projects to achieve what they said they would achieve."
5267,2022-06-17 04:31:46+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"5/ The low cappers have a really hard time establishing multiple all time highs. 
When the marketing and the hype dies, those projects have nowhere to go but down. The issue is some of them have really great ideas. They sound good. The teams seem authentic."
5268,2022-06-17 04:31:46+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"3/ But not everyone has gone through my journey and I support content creators monetizing. But I do say after spending more time in the market and examining the long term results for the low cappers, they generally lose."
5269,2022-06-17 04:31:46+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"2/ I have 1.45 Million subscribers. 70% of them came in last year near peaks in a bull market. Now's the time where I've had to mature and stop going to the well w/ what they want‚Ä¶ but give them what they NEED. Which is a dose of BTC, ETH, &amp; top alts primarily."
5270,2022-06-17 04:31:45+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"1/ Part V:

In 2019, I got some advice from some much bigger YouTubers who felt sorry for me. They stressed to me that I should focus on giving my audience what they wanted instead of what I thought they needed. That's the key to YouTube's algorithm. 
But the year is 2022. https://t.co/MKuisX8kkV"
5271,2022-06-17 04:31:01+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,25/ You see my love for these low cap altcoins really started because that's what my audience wanted to see. I know that‚Ä¶ because the views reflected it‚Ä¶ and the comments.
5272,2022-06-17 04:31:01+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"24/ We barely move out of the top 10 to 20 these days. And that's safer for my audience ESPECIALLY in this market. 
There may be a time where we dive deep on CMC but will be few and far between."
5273,2022-06-17 04:31:01+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"23/ Also, this was added 6 months after the project was launched. We launched in September and didn't add this utility until March. 
I want my voice to never be influenced by outside sources. And I can tell you I'm not ever talking about coin #663 on CMC anymore."
5274,2022-06-17 04:31:00+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"22/ In a bear market. We'll discuss Pluto Alliance a little later with worst witchhunts of 2022. 
Also NO THAT IS NOT A FRACTIONALIZED NFT. It's done through a random draw and is voluntary. We can stop it whenever we want."
5275,2022-06-17 04:31:00+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"21/ I know my responsibility is bigger than other people's. I have multiple revenue streams. 
We even decided to give 100% of our YouTube profits away to our @PlutoAlliance NFT holders. We keep 25% for taxes, but generally we are giving out $35k to $45k per month to our holders."
5276,2022-06-17 04:31:00+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"20/ Big pharma, tricking people into buying gold coins, etc. 
In January of this year, we decided to no longer do sponsored videos. Why? I had really not wanted to do them for 6 months. Finally we ripped that bandaid off and do no sponsored videos."
5277,2022-06-17 04:31:00+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,19/ I do not believe there is any problem with advertising. AS LONG AS IT IS DISCLOSED. If you are going to go after crypto companies then you better go after every news channel for the garbage ads they have on their channels.
5278,2022-06-17 04:31:00+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"18/ When we did sponsored videos, I had 30 to 40 so it's not like I was profiting $40k on every video. That gets split between editing hours, production hours, research hours, marketing hours, etc. A lot of people involved in every video."
5279,2022-06-17 04:30:59+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"17/ It's very few and far between because the big YouTubers especially know what's on the line. Every ad I did was disclosed for the history of my ENTIRE channel. 
5. I have now 60 employees."
5280,2022-06-17 04:30:59+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"16/ BECAUSE THEY CAN'T ADVERTISE THROUGH TRADITIONAL MEANS. Prices have some shock value for those outside industry. These prices would naturally weed out üóë 
4. There's this idea there's all this crypto YouTuber shilling circle where no one discloses their sponsored work. FALSE."
5281,2022-06-17 04:30:59+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"15/ No one ever goes after coins for doing advertisements. Only people who perform the advertisements. 
3. We had standard pricing for our size. I don't think you guys understand how much money is in crypto advertising on socials."
5282,2022-06-17 04:30:59+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"14/ We maybe did one or two per week out of at least 14 total videos. 
Most projects have marketing budgets literally baked into their tokenomics and founder token distributions. It's not like they hid their marketing budgets from people."
5283,2022-06-17 04:30:59+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,13/ 2. I often through my marketing team would receive hundreds of requests per day sometimes thousands per week. Almost any project at the time wanted coverage.Few would ever make it to a response &amp; a conversation.
5284,2022-06-17 04:30:59+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"12/ By the way, some side effects from the drugs advertised on CNBC have LITERALLY KILLED PEOPLE. Let me say it louder for people in the back: LITERALLY PEOPLE HAVE DIED BRO. L-I-T-E-R-A-L-L-Y"
5285,2022-06-17 04:30:58+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"11/ We will end probably with the dumbest outcry‚Ä¶ but this is too juicy right now to stop. Here are 5 things I think are absolutely pivotal for people to understand: 
1. Influencers have prices. @CNBC has prices for big pharma spots on their shows."
5286,2022-06-17 04:30:58+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"10/ I immediately confirmed it was real because this is one of the dumbest outcries ever. It wasn't leaked. Someone pretended to want info on a deal and put it on Twitter. 
If anyone ever asked, we freely handed out. Because we didn't care."
5287,2022-06-17 04:30:58+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"9/ At this point we are going to start working through your this infamous thread: https://t.co/ADYGEfbnbE 
When I did sponsored videos‚Ä¶ I had A MEDIA KIT! INSANITY! How dare I show my prices to prospective projects."
5288,2022-06-17 04:30:58+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,8/ We beefed up our research &amp; marketing teams and developed new strategies for filtering projects. And now this is when things get INSANELY CRAZY. WE MADE A MEDIA SHEET &amp; SOMEONE LEAKED IT OMG NO!!!!! https://t.co/QhSif2i9eO
5289,2022-06-17 04:30:58+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,7/ I hired a friend as content developer who became my business partner by the end of the year. We are getting hundreds of requests to work with companies in a sponsored fashion every single week. Sometimes daily. It's a lot to manage you know?
5290,2022-06-17 04:30:57+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"6/ I had 25 employees and we purchased a 40,000 square foot building to build studios and expand our business. While we waited to move to the new building, we had to temporarily rent a 2nd office. 
It was wild times."
5291,2022-06-17 04:30:57+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"5/ By June, we needed to hire more to scale and we rented one room at my stepdad's printing company. 
9 months later we would have more employees than them and we were out of parking."
5292,2022-06-17 04:30:57+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"4/ 9 months later everyone wants a piece of me. That's a lot to sort out. Dramatic life &amp; career changes. 
I hired my first employee in March 2020. It was my 19 year old sister at the time. Still works for me now when she's home from college. Dubbed the Assisterant."
5293,2022-06-17 04:30:57+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"3/ One year later, it looked dire. 2020 hit. Pandemic hit. Boom 9 months later I did it. 
That 9 months was just a whirlwind. In the beginning, nobody cared about me. People don't think you are going to make it. Everyone asking me if I was going to get a job."
5294,2022-06-17 04:30:57+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"2/ It was like watching my entire family try to deal with a spatial handicap. 
I promised my wife within 2 years, I would buy us a house with cash... while we were flat broke. Don't know how she did it, but she stuck with me and supported me the whole time."
5295,2022-06-17 04:30:56+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"1/ Part IV:

Then we secured a rental. Was too tiny for my family but was all we could afford. Literally zero yard in the back. Our kids weren't used to this. It was awful. They hated it. Our dogs had nowhere to run. https://t.co/nWbAPZGNyG"
5296,2022-06-17 04:30:02+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"23/ But as a grown man with 3 kids and 4 dogs at the time, it was HUMILIATING."
5297,2022-06-17 04:30:02+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"22/ I risked my family's future on crypto. 
For the first two months, we literally lived in my mom's basement. What a meme ammirite? Not because we couldn't get a rental, but because I was waiting to hear about a potential TV job in California."
5298,2022-06-17 04:30:02+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,21/ only possession my family really had which was our home. The house all three of my kids grew up in. Big back yard. But it was the only way we could survive. We sold it and made about $70k. I put $20k into crypto and we lived off the rest.
5299,2022-06-17 04:30:02+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"20/ I was broke. I didn't have money. I rode the bear to zero from 2017 (which was less than $10k at its peak, but still a big deal for me at the time). When I say I went all in, I believed in this channel and crypto so much, that I sold the"
5300,2022-06-17 04:30:01+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"19/ And it was the only thing that sustained me and my family in the last throws of my ""pre-success"" YouTube days. That person knows who he is. If it wasn't for him, I may be selling roofs today. BTC was at $6k btw when I borrowed it. 
You see I went all in on crypto in 2018."
5301,2022-06-17 04:30:01+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"18/ Things I couldn't have imagined only a few months earlier when I was still doing side hustles to feed my family. In fact, there was a time where a friend let me borrow 2 Bitcoin. That was how my kids had Christmas. 
That‚Äôs how we caught up on 2 months worth of bills."
5302,2022-06-17 04:30:01+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"17/ To 1.45 million only a few months later? There's no manual for this. It took me a while to figure out that this unfortunate 
newfound power came with a gigantic amount of responsibility."
5303,2022-06-17 04:30:01+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"16/ It's something I LITERALLY COULD NOT CONTROL. And also keep in mind this was a learning 
curve for me. Have you ever gone from 2 years of no one watching your videos and less than 10k subscribers to 100k in 8 months? To 1 million 9 months later?"
5304,2022-06-17 04:30:01+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"15/ Did I enjoy having power knowing that when I made a video, 
often the price would go up? NO. ABSOLUTELY NOT. I HATED IT. I liked the views. But I detested that power. I longed for a day when that wouldn't happen. It surprised me every time it did."
5305,2022-06-17 04:30:00+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"14/ ofc many don't listen. 
So let's get to the heart of the matter here. The thing that's so taboo no one will dare speak of it. When my channel discussed projects or brought awareness to them, prices generally went up. Looking back, it's facts."
5306,2022-06-17 04:30:00+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"13/ and smaller than 10% for general top 100. BUT YOU NEVER SAY THAT. YOU ALWAYS CONVENIENTLY LEAVE THAT OUT. We've always taught a proper balanced portfolio. So even if a coin drops 99% and it was a low capper, theoretically you should have lost less than 5%."
5307,2022-06-17 04:30:00+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"12/ And also btw, we always advocated people only use 5% max of their portfolios for coins outside of the top 200. AKA low cap gems we looked at. We've always said at least 50% BTC &amp; ETH. Then vast majority of remaining portfolio should be heavily leaning on top 10 to 20 coins"
5308,2022-06-17 04:30:00+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"11/ Now the question is are they all still millionaires? as we've seen with the market cap drop, most likely many of them have lost that status. But we preached taking profits."
5309,2022-06-17 04:30:00+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"10/ Zach I highly doubt there is another channel that made more millionaires than mine over the entirety of 2018 to 2021 
I know because I've met them. And I've talked to them. In person. People in my family became millionaires."
5310,2022-06-17 04:29:59+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,9/ But you know as well as I do that there is no way my channel would have continued to grow and those videos continue to perform well if literally no one made money.
5311,2022-06-17 04:29:59+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,8/ there's always a buyer and a seller in every transaction. So for ever person that bought the top there was a bag holder or speculator who won the trade. We've established pretty well it wasn't me. And I've given you some bad actors who could have been benefactors.
5312,2022-06-17 04:29:59+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,7/ Something I talk about a lot is intellectual honesty. People like @CNBC cherry picked some of my picks from 2020 that are down 90% or higher. OF COURSE IN THE BEAR MARKET they are down considerably. But we always tell people to take profits. You know...

5320,2022-06-17 04:29:17+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"31/ We have internal policies here against anyone using information from videos to profit if that video is not public. I really wish you knew how many times I intentionally didn't sell coins at high peaks, knowing they were going down substantially, to keep my integrity in check."
5321,2022-06-17 04:29:17+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,30/ And that's what those who prey on influencers COUNT ON. Notice the projects don't ever get slammed. Only the influencers. Especially if it's sponsored. More on that later ofc
5322,2022-06-17 04:29:16+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"29/ Occam's Razor would suggest that if it doesn't swim, if it doesn't quack, if it doesn't fly‚Ä¶ then it is most likely not a duck. 
And I know you've looked. A chart going up and down is not evidence. Can be a great red herring though."
5323,2022-06-17 04:29:16+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"28/ By now though Zach, you know the level of scrutiny I'm under. If there was evidence out there of P&amp;D‚Ä¶ it's all on the blockchain. It would be known."
5324,2022-06-17 04:29:16+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,27/ the same mistake twice. We've enacted big changes to policies several times to protect our audience. I‚Äôve always tried to improve and do things better. I think you would be hard pressed to say the Channel isn‚Äôt better than it was in 2020.
5325,2022-06-17 04:29:16+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"26/ With each bull run up &amp; crypto crash, I learn more. We all do. We learned ""Not Your Keys, Not Your Crypto"" is more relevant now than ever. We learned 18% staking is unsustainable. We learned no crypto outside of Bitcoin is ""too big to fail"". I've always tried to never repeat"
5326,2022-06-17 04:29:16+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"25/ Have I predicted things that never came true? Yea of course. Did I also nail a bunch of things? Yea of course I did. Did I trust Celsius? Yea, probably a big mistake but many in the same boat. And I'm going to my best to fight for those hurt by this."
5327,2022-06-17 04:29:15+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"24/ I hope we can co-exist and maybe you can share some of your findings on my channel one day. But see, I‚Äôve always thought long term. That's why there has never been a benefit to me intentionally hurting my followers. 
Have I made mistakes?"
5328,2022-06-17 04:29:15+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"23/ And this time we won't get slowed down with a lot of the lingering questions you put out in the air. Because no company can ever pay to be seen again. We give away our YouTube ad $$$ 
I am going to be around in 10 years. I hope you are too."
5329,2022-06-17 04:29:15+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"22/ If you and your followers haven't figured it out yet, I'm NOT GOING ANYWHERE. We have slowed down at the moment‚Ä¶ but my time to blow up again will come 
I'll only get bigger and with things we have moving behind the scenes this is just the beginning."
5330,2022-06-17 04:29:15+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"21/ A vast array of dark shadowy figures lurking quietly wrecking new buyers and pointing fingers at me. Bc OBVIOUSLY BITBOY DID IT! 
To be fair I probably should have smartened up to the game a little quicker than I did and I could have saved myself some pain."
5331,2022-06-17 04:29:15+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"20/ The post above makes it seem like only insiders were moving the coin preparing for dumpage. EVERYONE KNEW. I MADE IT PUBLIC! 
That is the predatory type environment I was in back then (so glad to not cover low cap coins or do any sponsored videos/social media posts anymore)."
5332,2022-06-17 04:29:15+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"19/ Learned a very valuable lesson that day to try to never mention future videos. That was a brutal one. That video was sponsored. 
Only a few minutes after the video, it had already crashed 50%. And this is exactly what I mean by things aren't always as they appear."
5333,2022-06-17 04:29:14+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"18/ Who always got blamed? Me. 
Here's a great reference for this last example: https://t.co/OnkKpZN7h4 
I mentioned on my show a few days before I would be doing a video on SOUL. People knew it was coming."
5334,2022-06-17 04:29:14+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"17/ That happened for sure. 
Did I kick off an internal investigation to find him? YES. Did I fire him immediately after trapping him? YES. Were there plans enacted to purposely make me look bad by the community of a YouTuber who hated me? YES. DEFINITELY happened."
5335,2022-06-17 04:29:14+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"16/ Were there projects who leaked I was doing a video on them 
and community members anticipated a pump and sold after the videos? YES. I'm sure of it. Did I have a rogue researcher on my unpaid research team who was leaking picks to their friends and others? YES."
5336,2022-06-17 04:29:14+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,15/ Did VC groups prey on my videos and sell their seed round tokens for coins I talked about? YES. I'm sure of it. Did marketing managers send me jobs and then go buy the coins and sell after the videos? YES. I'm sure of it.
5337,2022-06-17 04:29:13+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,14/ Because I have never created a video for the purpose of sending a coin up in price so I can sell that coin quickly after to wreck my followers. Now did founders use me to do it themselves unknowing to me? YES. I'm sure of it.
5338,2022-06-17 04:29:13+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"13/ You even pointed out at least once, the sentiment, ""Ok so doesn't look there's any evidence BitBoy is actually pumping and dumping‚Ä¶ but he promotes SCAMS!"" We'll get to that in a few. 
And I actually really appreciated that."
5339,2022-06-17 04:29:13+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"12/ We even covered Axie Infinity and its related SLP token. Kardianchain. These projects all crushed it and had plenty of great returns for people who took profits. And many did. 
I did notice over time, that you stopped using conjecture of me pumping and dumping."
5340,2022-06-17 04:29:13+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"11/ I even bought a node that I forgot about for a year and found last year with $70k on it. That's a win. And we covered a lot of winners during that time. 
Hyprr crushed it two different times with a big retrace in the middle. Dexkit did awesome."
5341,2022-06-17 04:29:13+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"10/ And that they would level off and by the end of 2021 they really would 1000x. I thought I was sitting on gold mines. 
Some like $CEEK VR did do extremely well. It went up 7000% from where I bought in at."
5342,2022-06-17 04:29:13+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"9/ At least pretty far into 2021, many of the projects I covered during 2020 as top picks had done pretty well. 
The prices would go insane. 2x, 3x, 5x, 10x, 17x in one day. That was the record. But you know what? I was naive. I really thought that those coins were good."
5343,2022-06-17 04:29:12+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"8/ As in the beginning of your attacks towards me you automatically would call me 
a pump and dumper. And on the surface it probably seemed almost too obvious. I would do a video, chart would go up, peak at some point, and then drop considerably."
5344,2022-06-17 04:29:12+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,7/ But one thing I'm extremely grateful to him for and why I say he is fair is because he at least reaches out to me for my side of things. Things aren't always as they appear. And @zachxbt you know this.
5345,2022-06-17 04:29:12+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,6/ Anything Brock Pierce is involved in is something to be wary of. My point in disagreement is that TODAY they do have the assets to back it so it's a moot point. USDC is safer though imo for sure.
5346,2022-06-17 04:29:12+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"5/ Outside of a couple bad takes on Tether, he's pretty on point. I really believe he's good people. Sadly, the interview as mentioned never aired. 
Sidenote: Tether and Bitfinex are awful. USDT was definitely a scam at some point."
5347,2022-06-17 04:29:12+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"4/ He was skeptical of me because I think he thought I was simply trying to control narrative by contacting him. 
Like I was pre-emptively keeping friends close and enemies closer. It was disappointing because I always like Coffeezilla. I still do."
5348,2022-06-17 04:29:11+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"3/ The guy definitely is a skeptic. 
Said he can't ever give a plagiarizer the benefit of the doubt because he's seen it too many times. But I hope that one is put to bed."
5349,2022-06-17 04:29:11+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"2/ When you raised that one, one user pointed out that it was just a random trading view chart. You didn‚Äôt do anything original to it. But regardless, Coffeezilla brought all of this up in our interview. I said all the same stuff that I said above."
5350,2022-06-17 04:29:11+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"1/ Part II:

Of course I did show one of your tweets on a livestream and zoomed it in so people couldn‚Äôt see your name. I really don‚Äôt like promoting someone who constantly attacks me with some absolutely provable false claims. Some legit criticism for sure. https://t.co/BxlLmJyjGn"
5351,2022-06-17 04:27:34+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"24/ 3,000 videos. 2 plagairized sentences. 2 gifs used in NFTs. 2 accidental uses of charts with improper credit. Works out to about 99.9% of my content free of credit errors."
5352,2022-06-17 04:27:34+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"23/ I need to bring more help in and I needed to slow down what I was doing. One of my social media interns posted someone's chart without credit recently. 2 years later I still cringe. 
0 instances in between. I think that should prove that those were outliers. Not the rule."
5353,2022-06-17 04:27:33+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"22/ Next day, I issued an apology at beginning of new video, gave the proper trading group credit and told people where to go to join.
Here's a reference for that: https://t.co/qlBpeeTV2c 
I realized though that with 3 mistakes back to back to back so close, it didn't look good."
5354,2022-06-17 04:27:33+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"21/ It was longer than that but that was gist of it. Ever misread a text Zach? Or an email? Never once? Maybe in a hurry &amp; didn't skim well?
I misread it and then I threw the chart image at the beginning of one of my videos and said our discord group was making gains."
5355,2022-06-17 04:27:33+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"20/ I skimmed the message and I thought he said that was our chart from our discord group he put together.
What the text actually said was something similar to ""Hey Ben. Check this chart out. We should do something like this for our discord group."""
5356,2022-06-17 04:27:33+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"19/ Sounds sketchy until you realize that IT'S LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO PASS OFF ANYTHING NOT MINE AS MINE
Are you not seeing the incredible amount of scrutiny that I live under at all times. One of my researchers sent me a chart from a trading group on discord I think."
5357,2022-06-17 04:27:33+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"18/ Had been with me and my wife since our first year of marriage. I was crushed. I had just enough time
to wipe my tears and walk into what was my first self-inflicted Twitter firestorm. Once again, mistake and I own it‚Ä¶ I accidentally used someones profit chart as my own."
5358,2022-06-17 04:27:33+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"17/ They made thousands of dollars of ETH on accident! When ETH was about $200 to $300 each.
And of course as bad things come in 3's, shortly after this‚Ä¶ on the very day that I had to put my first dog I ever owned down‚Ä¶ who slept with my oldest son his whole life."
5359,2022-06-17 04:27:32+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"16/ You could steal a whole NFT and be fine‚Ä¶ but I was daily crucified for my gif sins.
I definitely thought it was ridiculous. Still, I took responsibility and on my own‚Ä¶ without pressure‚Ä¶ decided I would send all of the revenue from those two NFTs to the original artists."
5360,2022-06-17 04:27:32+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"15/ Especially when at the time we were the top seller on Rarible. 
Each day Rarible processed sale after sale of right click save duplicates of my completely original BitVerse NFTs. But there didn‚Äôt seem to be any concern early on for the scams."
5361,2022-06-17 04:27:32+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"14/ I was held to a higher standard than other novice NFT creators. One of the biggest detractors‚Ä¶
was a guy whose literal logo was the Nirvana logo. Can‚Äôt make this stuff up. Those were the early days of NFTs on Rarible. I definitely thought it was hypocritical."
5362,2022-06-17 04:27:32+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"13/ One did use a gif from Google Images as foundation and another
used a gif of random hands making a circle and we put a heart or a logo or something in the middle of it. Don‚Äôt remember them being copyrighted or not but that didn‚Äôt matter."
5363,2022-06-17 04:27:32+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"12/ Looking for any piece of clip art, a gif, color schemes, anything where they could say I stole something from someone. I think out of 100 or so different NFT designs, there were 2 of them that the witchhunters found."
5364,2022-06-17 04:27:31+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,11/ Internet detectives exhausted every video on my channel and couldn't find another single occurrence. So what did they do next? Went through every NFT my team ever produced
5365,2022-06-17 04:27:31+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"10/ Out of 2,000ish videos at the time, one time we didn't properly credit someone. It's not right and was definitely a mistake, but we took responsibility
for the mistake and issued an apology. It was all the rage on the internet to say I was a plagiarizer."
5366,2022-06-17 04:27:31+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"9/ About this time though my first twitter controversy stirred up. Long and short of it was one of my script
writers plagairized two sentences. Really if in editing we just showed a screenshot of the sentences it would have been fine."
5367,2022-06-17 04:27:31+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"8/ I really thought I could help him sort out common scams in crypto as he was pretty green at the time.
I went on his channel for a never seen interview. He said that he didn't think he went hard enough on me. I was kind of bummed because I thought together we could HELP."
5368,2022-06-17 04:27:30+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"7/ Not perfect as we will see much later in this letter
But I think you've gotten better about that. I used to watch every @coffeebreak_YT video before anyone even knew who I was. I was super excited to connect with him in 2020."
5369,2022-06-17 04:27:30+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"6/ there is a lot of what you do that is very valuable and helpful to the crypto community. For the most part, you and @coffeebreak_YT... when not going solely on conjecture and here-say... are absolutely pivotal to hold people accountable."
5370,2022-06-17 04:27:30+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"5/ I'm not here to point fingers back at you. Regardless of whatever is in your closet, this is where you ended up. Not sure if your motives were pure at first or if it was about building a platform on larger accounts clout, but the fact is at this point‚Ä¶"
5371,2022-06-17 04:27:30+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,4/ I want to be clear. That‚Äôs not a threat. I could honestly care less who you are IRL. That info came to me without me looking for it. I‚Äôm not giving that info out to anyone. I think it‚Äôs actually in everyone‚Äôs best interest at this point for you to stay anonymous.
5372,2022-06-17 04:27:30+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,3/ I think what you will find is that we actually aren't very different. I‚Äôve heard a mixed bag of things about your beginnings. But I don‚Äôt know you from Adam. I‚Äôve got a picture of you. I know your name. I know some people close to you. I know where you generally stay.
5373,2022-06-17 04:27:29+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"2/ Dear @zachxbt,

It's been a while my friend since you have used my name in a derogatory manner. Yesterday‚Äôs was pretty harmless, but I‚Äôve been wanting to have this conversation with you for a while. You really have me all wrong."""
5374,2022-06-17 04:27:29+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"1/ Part I: 
This may be the most exhaustive 6 part thread in the history of Twtter. This is my open letter to @zachxbt. Maybe something comes from this, maybe it doesn't. But it‚Äôs time all this has to be said."
5375,2022-06-17 02:39:28+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,I'm about to probably do the dumbest or smartest thing I've ever done on Twitter. Get your popcorn.
5376,2022-06-17 00:40:01+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@GhostofSvetski Bro having to talk to you in real life would be my very worst nightmare. You are the most pretentious person I‚Äôve ever seen. I‚Äôm shocked you can even be in the same room with a normal human. I imagine you probably just walk around in a constant state of dry heaving.

5380,2022-06-16 21:56:20+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"@GhostofSvetski I‚Äôm sure man.

You don't think every company has that line lol

It's an American company. It can be sued and held liable for mismanagement."

We have enough to cover the ETH loan which then frees up the ETH we had as collateral which should have enough to cover the Bitcoin loan. But we aren't concerned about the BTC loan. ETH is close to liquidation.

I do urge you though if you specifically have less than $25k in assets on Celsius then take them to small claims court immediately and you could potentially win before bankruptcy is filed.

The scammers are relentless and will do anything to get more money out of you. @CelsiusNetwork and @Mashinsky ARE THESE SCAMMERS. @ronald_loh also.
5477,2022-06-15 10:22:31+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"You see, the victim is told they can pull off their money anytime. By paying an administrative fee if $5,000. Which hurts, but remember there‚Äôs $100,000 on the line?! So the scammer is easily able to get more money from their victims."
5478,2022-06-15 10:22:30+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"Paying off student debt, buying a car, medical bills, maybe even a down payment for a house. This is an important part of the scam. Because while the victim actually has only lost $1k, to them it feels like a $100,000k loss. So this is where @CelsiusNetwork twists the knife."
5479,2022-06-15 10:22:30+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"Keep in mind these victims are real people. With families. Who have been praying for a big break. And now they have finally found it. But sadly, we know the $100,000 is not actually there.

But in the victim‚Äôs mind this money is ironclad, they already have plans for it."
5480,2022-06-15 10:22:30+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"And each day the victims account grows. But there‚Äôs no money in there. It‚Äôs just numbers on a screen set to increase every day on a timer (sounding familiar yet?)

After a few months the victim‚Äôs account grows significantly from $1,000 all the way to $100,000! So rich!"
5481,2022-06-15 10:22:30+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"Next, the scammer has the victim create an account on what is basically a fake trading platform. The website looks like a regular platform but it is all just code. There‚Äôs actually nothing backing the platform. But the website code shows the victims account in ‚Äúreal time‚Äù."
5482,2022-06-15 10:22:30+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"Someone says they are an expert crypto trader and they can give a new investor big daily returns on a small investment. So the victim gets tricked and sends the scammer $1,000 (in some cases much more)"
5483,2022-06-15 10:22:29+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,Does this all sound familiar? Holding peoples‚Äô money hostage? Well it should. Because it‚Äôs the most common scam for petty hackers/phishers. Here‚Äôs how it works:
5484,2022-06-15 10:22:29+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"As they head towards bankruptcy. Make no mistake about it, at this point now that I see their game, it‚Äôs only a matter of time before their biggest position gets liquidated at ~$16,500 for $BTC. That‚Äôs coming. They know it. As that gets closer, they are pulling out all the stops"
5485,2022-06-15 10:22:29+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"This is a PURE SCAM to try to bring in fresh money from users to pay off loans. You see, once Ethereum hits a certain number, we get liquidated and lose all of our collateral against the loan. So they are trying to take advantage of fear in the market to pad their pockets."
5486,2022-06-15 10:22:29+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"Great and logical question. Glad you asked.

IT‚ÄôS BECAUSE THEY ARE TOTALLY INSOLVENT. The money that shows in our account isn‚Äôt actually there. That‚Äôs the only reason we can‚Äôt use it. It‚Äôs not there. And these idiots have the audacity to think that we are going to send more?"
5487,2022-06-15 10:22:29+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"Imagine an insolvent company that you can‚Äôt withdraw your money from ASKING YOU TO SEND THEM MORE MONEY.

It‚Äôs best bet is capitalizing on defi and building the ecosystem out more‚Ä¶ which will probably take bulk of bear market to do.
5737,2022-05-24 04:22:58+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"@UbiquitousUs I definitely agree this is a possibility. Would take some type of black swan event though (take your pick out of 17 potential ones right now lol). 

Other route is slow death and then final capitulation following midterms. I tend to think that one is most likely based on history"

5740,2022-05-24 01:26:21+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,Not that this is helpful‚Ä¶ but I think it‚Äôs almost exactly 50/50. But I think 80% chance we see $24k by end of year.

5743,2022-05-24 01:18:06+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"@intocryptoverse Most likely you are correct. I expect to see it at 50-55%.

Because of this, there is some upside to scaling as long as BTC is under $30k."

5746,2022-05-24 01:11:27+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@intocryptoverse I agree. Very very few alts I would be adding here. $ETH $XRP for sure. Even $ADA is borderline.

5747,2022-05-24 00:54:53+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"@intocryptoverse Altcoins are cheap. They most likely will become cheaper‚Ä¶ but a 50 cent ADA is still a good entry overall. Spent almost all of 2019 at 5 cents. Not time to go all in here, but scaling  entries right now I think is beneficial."

5968,2022-03-29 20:09:48+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@TAIGxrp You have a bunch of old guys trying to regulate things they don‚Äôt understand. You can‚Äôt mislead people on something you don‚Äôt even understand yourself. Bottom line is they are just dumb. It‚Äôs not a conspiracy.
5969,2022-03-29 18:46:39+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"Point is, #ETHGate is much ado about nothing. But honestly it makes me feel like we are closer than ever to a settlement. The anger &amp; frustration with the SEC is at an ATH. In the next several months when this case ends &amp; $XRP goes to the moon, no one will be talking about this"
5970,2022-03-29 18:46:38+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"He leaves #Ripple and then co-founds a competitor that makes the centralization issues of Ripple look extremely miniscule. ""Don't like your supply, then let's just burn it with no input from community &amp; change the tokenomics we promised!"""
5971,2022-03-29 18:46:38+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"He's sitting back laughing at all this while probably assisting the SEC. Weird isn't it that this guy was responsible for biggest hack in crypto history, co-founded Ripple, and somehow has slithered out of even getting mentioned in lawsuit?"
5972,2022-03-29 18:46:37+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,You are dreaming if you think that is true. There is a much bigger glaring problem with $XLM than $ETH. And the co-founder of Stellar would love nothing more than to see XRP falter. Father of lies Jed McCaleb loves nothing more than watching $XRP fight with $ETH holders.
5973,2022-03-29 18:46:37+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"And even if it WERE true, there is no path for the SEC to bring a case against Ethereum. There isn't an American company behind it like Ripple is behind $XRP. Basically Ripple is a much easier target than Ethereum. After the botched XRP-SEC case, no chance SEC goes after ETH."
5974,2022-03-29 18:46:36+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,Ripple was unfairly targeted. Ethereum was not. This is where the anger from the #XRPArmy comes into play and why people are so up in arms about this. You are angry &amp; that emotion needs a target. Ethereum is not the enemy. Your anger is misplaced via a conspiracy theory w/o proof
5975,2022-03-29 18:46:36+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,I believe that was the moment Jay Clayton decided to go after them. He also dumped the case at the feet of Dirty Gary Gensler because he didn't know how they could win the case so he passed it off to the next guy; impossible task of proving an illegal token sale w/o notice
5976,2022-03-29 18:46:35+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,But that's short term. If you didn't sell during that time then it didn't even really matter. Wouldn't you want the project you are invested in to remain profitable so they can achieve everything they have promised? But the optics of this admission were very bad.
5977,2022-03-29 18:46:34+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,Here is the real conspiracy: SEC unfairly has targeted #Ripple Labs. I believe this occurred when the news came out over 2019 that Brad Garlinghouse &amp; company were selling off their XRP holdings to remain profitable as a company. This led to drops in price and hurt the community
5978,2022-03-29 18:46:34+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"While I certainly love a good conspiracy, applying Occam's Razor to this should leave you with the opinion, that most likely the most obvious outcome is the answer. William Hinman gave Bitcoin &amp; ETH a pass as not securities which provides XRP with a roadmap to win SEC case."
5979,2022-03-29 18:46:33+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"I know people who invested in the ICO. A lot of people. Like IRL. So the question is, if I know people who bought it, where was the cover up? The sale was very public. So at minimum, the public had a fair shot to buy ETH ICO and participate in governance, network, etc."
5980,2022-03-29 18:46:33+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"According to the theory, only a few people actually invested in Ethereum and the foundation manipulated the public to believe that individuals were buying the ICO. But actually founders of Ethereum... Vitalik, Charles, Gavin, Joseph &amp; others controlled supply."
5981,2022-03-29 18:46:32+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,Nothing about these allegations have been proven. It's a conspiracy theory that a small pool of early Ethereum insiders paid off SEC officials to look the other way. The ICO was more centralized than it appeared due to an intentionally confusing web of wallet addresses.
5982,2022-03-29 18:46:32+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"The #XRPArmy has been asking me to make some statements on #ETHGate. So here is a thread.

That's not Ethereum"
5990,2022-03-28 21:28:48+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@Leerzeit What is the win here? You want the SEC to go after Ethereum that they already deemed not a security? I don't think opening up old wounds in crypto is beneficial for #ripple when part of their argument is $ETH is not a security

10929,2020-03-20 02:00:08+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@Mastrhiggins They would really narrow down who get run for office including our president

10931,2020-03-20 01:55:48+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@cryptodotbi Okay but is it insider trading if it isn‚Äôt a specific tip? Like you just have inside info the world is crumbling?

12506,2020-01-01 21:22:40+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@RobMcNealy No arguing there. But there are a lot of good people who have done it the right way.
12507,2020-01-01 21:18:58+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"@RobMcNealy There are not many who do not disclose. During 2017, many did not. We all know who they are.

12511,2020-01-01 21:07:35+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@RobMcNealy Their communities kill them for influencer marketing? Never seen it. Of course Payday Lenders are an outlier bc I‚Äôm pretty sure they don‚Äôt have a community

15880,2019-05-31 19:41:00+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@cryptorunner3 No I just mean standard living condition of middle class and poor people.

16353,2019-05-06 20:51:03+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,Update #2: seems as if the general consensus of CT is that this is groundbreaking information. Seems as if 4/5 CT personalities did not know this. The other 1/5 seems to have already discovered it but feels as if it is a scam.
16354,2019-05-06 20:38:13+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,Update #1: This information is not well received by everyone

16367,2019-05-06 02:46:49+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@MikeMeezy8 I think they don‚Äôt have it bc people could manipulate tweets very easily. But yea super annoying
16368,2019-05-06 02:43:12+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@bitcoinbella_ The majority of crypto ‚Äúnews‚Äù sites aren‚Äôt news sites. Basically glorified blogs. There‚Äôs no journalism and no accountability for what they write. So there‚Äôs a lot of misinformation out there portrayed as news that is just some guy in his mom‚Äôs basement throwing out opinions.
16369,2019-05-06 02:35:02+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"@bitcoinbella_ You‚Äôre the legal expert so I‚Äôll take your word for it. I‚Äôm just saying the investigation itself is certainly valid news, but a lot of the stories that were written about it claiming this is the end, sky is falling, etc. is where the line between reporting and FUD is drawn."
16370,2019-05-06 02:32:04+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"@bitcoinbella_ In addition, this is not federal investigation. It‚Äôs a New York State investigation so not sure how much jurisdiction they would have to shut Bitfinex down even if found guilty."
16371,2019-05-06 02:31:07+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@bitcoinbella_ Ok what is worse: BitFinex getting shut down (worst case scenario) or finding out Tether was never backed and the entire bull run was propped up by air?
16372,2019-05-06 02:27:28+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@bitcoinbella_ The FUD is what ensued after the report. The fear mongering. The fact is the action in a roundabout way shows Tether did actually have the money to back it. Seemed like actually more good than bad.

16375,2019-05-05 23:45:45+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@FOMOBYDICK It‚Äôs funny because that‚Äôs a real seal while your tweet implies it‚Äôs the famous Navy Seal Team 6. Another layer to this joke is that F is the 6th letter if the alphabet. Bravo.

16386,2019-05-05 04:46:50+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@KashPantz Lol what a brash generalization. You are the one who sounds like you have no respect for others. If you don‚Äôt respect someone because they live in a certain country you are as closed minded as it gets.
16387,2019-05-05 04:42:41+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@HODLFUEL I mean I like my BitBoy hats pretty good but that one will go down as my all time favorite hat. It was a braves hat so it was only the right thing to do.

16872,2019-04-07 15:43:54+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@crptwrld_info They just wanted me to add a phone number. Should be good now.
16873,2019-04-07 02:43:19+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"@HodlHold Yea of course there will be some. 

But many of the better ideas have already been launched or in the case where many projects are doing the same things, leaders are emerging.

We are moving to a place where it‚Äôs time to actually start building on the platforms."

16878,2019-04-07 01:53:39+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@JM08107 I know people building on it and say good things. That gives me more confidence than 20 news articles.
16879,2019-04-07 01:49:59+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@FOMOBYDICK Few exceptions of course. A large reason why many of the micro cap and small cap coins pumped was because binance and bittrex closed for new accounts so people were exposed to super tiny coins by having to use smaller exchanges.

16972,2019-03-31 21:57:23+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@StillShillGates @BitcoinDood I understand your hesitation. I mean it was proven that some of the poker sites in the hey day were rigged. But imo blockchain gambling/poker is the future and will ease those fears.
16973,2019-03-31 21:49:11+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"@StillShillGates @BitcoinDood Aside from the fact it's all a bunch of open source code and any attempt to rig toward one player would be public knowledge, the provable fairness would allow anyone to see if one player or a group of players were getting better than the standard odds. Over time it bears out."
16974,2019-03-31 21:43:39+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"@StillShillGates @BitcoinDood All of the profits made by the house are split between Token holders. Therefore the house edge or in poker the rake is split. So even if you were to rig a huge amount of games, you just get a small fraction of the pot based upon how many tokens you hold."
16975,2019-03-31 21:32:16+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"@StillShillGates @BitcoinDood This link here should answer your questions. The long and short of it is that it is ran by a network of computers that cannot be rigged. The developer would have no need to rig it and if they did it would be evident on the blockchain.

16976,2019-03-31 21:17:39+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"@artmustaches I love Omaha.

16978,2019-03-31 21:13:46+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"@StillShillGates @BitcoinDood In addition, the dividends aka profit from the games on TronBet are split between all the people who own Ante (Token on the platform). So no incentive for the house to rig."
16979,2019-03-31 21:13:39+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"@StillShillGates @BitcoinDood In traditional poker rooms, you can't get information about the hands you were not involved in. So you could never prove the fairness. With games recorded on the blockchain you can see every transaction."
16980,2019-03-31 21:13:30+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"@StillShillGates @BitcoinDood The simplest reason is that every transaction (i.e. every action on every hand) is recorded on the blockchain. It's called ""provably"" fair because if someone wanted to, they could go through every transaction and prove that the odds line up. Every deal is on the blockchain."
16981,2019-03-31 21:05:28+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@artmustaches Cool where do you buy the token the platform uses? Does it have a feature to exchange BTC or other crypto for the token on the site?
16982,2019-03-31 21:04:41+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"@tronix_crypto @TRONbet Yes I agree with you on those points. It has not debuted yet, so I'm not sure if those features will be integrated or not when the platform debuts... which is supposed to be relatively soon."
16983,2019-03-31 21:03:04+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"@StillShillGates @BitcoinDood Blockchain gambling can't be rigged. It's provably fair on the blockchain. That's the point. I agree with you that many online poker rooms have at best ""questionable"" odds. Blockchain gambling removes the doubt."
16984,2019-03-31 20:59:26+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"@wildnad @RobAshley11 Tron is more than one man. Justin has nothing to do with the DApps and their DApp communities. Yes, Tron itself is responsible for the platform

Point is people can hate Justin &amp; still take part in these communities. Once they do, they will see the value in Tron and the ecosystem"
16985,2019-03-31 20:56:30+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"@BitcoinDood Why do you say that? Like the United States? 

All poker players here in non-poker states (majority) play illegally. Whether it's online on the various sites that allow U.S. players or at illegal home games/tournaments. Authorities only care if it involves organized crime."

17011,2019-03-30 02:18:31+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@thefatbitcoin haha just went and rewatched it. best ending though was Ocarina of Time when you had to leave Zelda and go back to being a boy. I literally cried as a 7th grader. I was so immersed in that game.
17012,2019-03-30 02:14:58+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@KevinTBray @thefatbitcoin yes at the end. that was the hardest game i ever played. finally beat it as an adult.
17013,2019-03-30 02:12:41+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@thefatbitcoin the MOST underrated one imo. People canned that one because of the weird graphic style. Only frustrating thing was sometimes having to sail for 10 minutes to get to a destination haha. But yea man LOVED that one.

17030,2019-03-29 20:47:25+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@1enjin @snoopdilla @justinsuntron Let me rephrase that. Best coin specific mobile wallet. Like it‚Äôs the wallet of the platform. You can do anything including use Tron DApps without ever leaving the platform. Plus it‚Äôs lightning quick and user friendly.
17031,2019-03-29 20:45:39+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@squatch_crypto Yes that‚Äôs the common sentiment. It‚Äôs personal. People hate Justin. But there‚Äôs a lot going on beneath the surface. He was what originally turned me off from Tron. But eventually I got past it and can see Tron for what it is.
17032,2019-03-29 20:32:00+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"@squatch_crypto Yea let‚Äôs see some details on your opinion. It‚Äôs easy for people to say they hate Tron, but 95% of those people have personal issues with Justin or they are regurgitating something they see on Twitter."
17033,2019-03-29 20:13:21+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"@squatch_crypto Provide the reasons you believe Tron is inferior. It‚Äôs out performing the competitors at the moment. Provide a comparison of DApps you have used.

17034,2019-03-29 20:10:19+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"@SecOfBitcoin @squatch_crypto To compare Tron to a scam like BitConnect is intellectually dishonest. BitConnect was a scam that was an attempt to pool people‚Äôs money and never give it back

When educated people call Tron a scam, what they are actually saying is ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it can scale like it says it can‚Äù"
17035,2019-03-29 20:04:13+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@squatch_crypto One day this stigma will leave. Once people realize how well it‚Äôs working and how high quality the DApps are the project is going to take off more than it already has.

17114,2019-03-22 02:57:19+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@CryptoRich22 @CryptoBrekkie We can definitely disagree and still be respectful. I've said many times I think a lot of the debates that turn malicious are due to the fact that we have 16 year olds and 50 year olds on Crypto Twitter trying to communicate without realizing age gap. Both are good for the space.

I do think the label is nonsensical because imo we don't really have a good definition of what a maximalist truly is.

17120,2019-03-21 19:58:57+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@trade2surf Yea I mean I think that‚Äôs a fine attitude tonhave about it. The militant maximalists are the ones that I can‚Äôt take seriously. They are like Patriots fans like @thefatbitcoin

Tone Vays is a true maximalist. He thinks literally every altcoin will fail."

17127,2019-03-21 16:14:33+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@WileECryptote @CryptoBrekkie I'm going to look into this more and put it in my news video tonight. I do not believe it's a myth. But I think understanding the facts a little better would help all of us.
17128,2019-03-21 16:13:22+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"@CryptoBrekkie yes I agree with you on both points. I don't think CWS is Satoshi at all. But CWS being Satoshi both made my post a joke and thought provoking. It's all about the clicks friend. But in all seriousness, there needs to be a distinction between maximalist and first placists"
17129,2019-03-21 16:08:33+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@WileECryptote @CryptoBrekkie I believe it's stored in multiple wallets. Could be closer to 600k-700k instead of a million. I don't believe to my knowledge anyone has the address if it is truly only in one wallet. The genesis wallet has about 70 BTC in it I believe. Could be wrong on all points.
17130,2019-03-21 16:00:20+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@CryptoBrekkie I agree but ‚Äúnear zero likelihood‚Äù represents a chance. And that‚Äôs just one scenario that could allow an altcoin to catch up. What if Amazon starts accepting XRP tomorrow? What if Alibaba started accepting Tron tmrw? To think BTC only in my mind is shortsighted imo
17131,2019-03-21 15:51:11+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"@CryptoBrekkie I think you are way underestimating what finding out who Satoshi is would do to the space. For instance, the 1M Bitcoins Satoshi has locked away are baked into the price. If at any given moment we believed that could enter the market, that would dramatically affect price."
17132,2019-03-21 15:46:38+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"@SatosiMr2 I certainly don't believe CWS is Satoshi lol

Not the point."
17133,2019-03-21 15:46:04+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"@CryptoBrekkie But the point is that we DON'T know what we DON'T know. That's just one example of something that could effect Bitcoin in the future. Don't get me wrong, I believe in BTC and do believe it will stay #1, but there are some scenarios where it could drop."
17134,2019-03-21 15:44:02+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"@CryptoBrekkie eh I don't believe that's  true. If we got proof CWS or ANYONE else alive is actually Satoshi, then that person would be able to shape the narrative. Would have more power than anyone in crypto. That's the beauty of not knowing who it is."

Don't be like Bob.

17636,2019-02-07 15:50:49+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@fuadviking @youngdumbcrypto @IOHK_Charles The most intelligent comment on this thread.
17637,2019-02-07 15:47:46+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@hashoshi4 @bitboycrypto Would prefer just Twitter on this one bc I‚Äôm going to call it Mean Tweets. But will definitely do a larger compilation one down the road.

17654,2019-02-07 06:59:28+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@AnirudhKash @IOHK_Charles @crodas This is the very crux of the whole anti-Tron argument. Is a moral decision an indicator of future failure as business?
17655,2019-02-07 06:55:02+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@CryptoBrekkie @IOHK_Charles @AnirudhKash Dude I love you
17656,2019-02-07 06:53:36+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@crodas @IOHK_Charles @AnirudhKash Yea us non devs are cancers to the space. 99% of humans. But cancers still.
17657,2019-02-07 06:52:13+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@bitcoinbella_ @thecryptosky Zod of course. And many unnamed souls but we are thinking about you.
17658,2019-02-07 06:50:24+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@bitcoinbella_ @thecryptosky True
17659,2019-02-07 06:50:10+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@CryptoShillNye @bitcoinbella_ @thecryptosky I miss you so. Feels like it‚Äôs been forever. Since you‚Äôve been gone.
17660,2019-02-07 06:48:30+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@bitcoinbella_ @thecryptosky Have also been wondering. So many prodigals these days
17661,2019-02-07 06:46:17+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@IOHK_Charles @AnirudhKash Also my second biggest bag is $ADA so don‚Äôt entrap me into FUDing my own bag. üòÇ
17662,2019-02-07 06:45:19+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@IOHK_Charles @AnirudhKash Not saying plagiarism is okay or I condone. Just at the end of the day of execution is better than that of ETH then Tron wins.
17663,2019-02-07 06:44:31+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@IOHK_Charles @AnirudhKash Yea they bought it for the user base imo. But that‚Äôs why I said it has yet to be seen. You are right not all acquisitions work out but hard for me to see this one failing with all the attention and hype. White paper copying is irrelevant if they execute it better than ETH.
17664,2019-02-07 06:37:51+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@IOHK_Charles Buying something successful makes you a winner if it continues to thrive under your watch. Don‚Äôt think there is a logical rebuttal to that. Its yet to be seen sir what BT will do under Tron‚Äôs watch. I would hope it fails too if I were you. No disrespect sir.

17921,2019-01-30 04:42:19+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@buyachickennugg But you make an interesting point. Scientists have a theory that if there is other intelligent life out there we all started at the same place:
17922,2019-01-30 04:41:43+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@buyachickennugg I guess I‚Äôm operating on the premise that what we see and the research we have is legit. That things aren‚Äôt being ‚Äúhidden‚Äù from us intentionally. I‚Äôm also operating under the notion that we have not yet made contact.

17926,2019-01-30 04:36:58+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@CryptoCentsible It‚Äôs all relative. I would say consciousness and awareness constitutes intelligent life. And I would only be talking about the real physical world &amp; not the spiritual world/other dimensions

17929,2019-01-30 04:32:55+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@buyachickennugg Yea that‚Äôs delving into something totally different. Taking the perspective that there are aliens and they have visited us is way too out there for me. I don‚Äôt get into conspiracies.

17932,2019-01-30 04:30:03+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@OCNalliance I mean we don‚Äôt know for sure it‚Äôs infinite. Seems impossible to prove.

17963,2019-01-29 18:41:55+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@whybotherasking Lol definitely not true. Time by itself will not produce life. I understand your point but that time must be spent under the right conditions.
17964,2019-01-29 18:39:51+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@CryptoGayGuy @bogatlynuts To me dimensions are much more interesting and leaves endless possibilities. But they also are not provable. That‚Äôs when you really start wondering if we are but a simulation.

It‚Äôs like that old joke about doing something silly to scare away monsters. The punch line is, well ya don‚Äôt see any monsters do you?"

17969,2019-01-29 17:20:13+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,Interesting poll. This reminds me of the polls near the end of February when 70% of people were still bullish despite the fact we were over a month into the bear market.
17970,2019-01-29 16:41:22+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@whybotherasking Big difference between life and intelligent life. I definitely believe a vast world of microbes and bacteria exists in space and on other planets.
17971,2019-01-29 16:39:28+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"@snoopdilla @chili_phil I am familiar with the Fermi Paradox. However, one of the basic tenets involved the fact there are probably planets like earth out there. I‚Äôm sure there are many planets like earth out there. An earthlike planet is only a sliver of what is required for life."
17972,2019-01-29 16:35:03+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@CryptoNinjaco @joerogan I actually saw that. Was interested in finding the source of that info. That video was actually what gave me the idea for this tweet. The physicist seemed pretty convinced we would only find microbes in space. Fits my worldview on it.

17976,2019-01-29 16:29:43+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@CryptoGayGuy Sounds a little conspiratorial to me. I opt not to really delve too far into the conspiracy theory realm as for the most part we really haven‚Äôt seen any major conspiracies proven to be true.

17979,2019-01-29 07:28:01+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,"@CryptoNinjaco Im pretty sure I remembered that haha. t‚Äôs more of the way scientists are perceived by the common person.

17988,2019-01-29 07:11:58+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@CryptoGayGuy Haha. In all seriousness I have done a pretty good amount of research on this and I believe that it‚Äôs basically a miracle we even exist. The idea of intelligent (not single cell microbes) life just comes from the fact we expect there to be based on the vastness of the universe.

Plus I think we instinctually want something external to provide us with meaning and clarity or what life is."
17998,2019-01-29 06:54:24+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@vectorcoin Once again I do not accept size as evidence. That‚Äôs the only evidence people use.

18128,2019-01-22 17:00:00+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@Dr_strange1 Maybe but more likely around the 11th for the airdrop. Plus something to factor in here is that TRX holders get rewarded monthly in BTT so that will encourage people to hold over time as well

After BTT launches and starts stabilizing/being used, look for @justinsuntron to buy another company. Not sure what it could be, but I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs done expanding the Tron reach"
18136,2019-01-22 16:02:27+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@urb_asc You could be right sir. I think this could push Tron up over 5 cents.
18137,2019-01-22 15:21:18+00:00,Bitboy_Crypto,@giants81514 Yea the airdrop won‚Äôt be much even if you have 1M TRX. But you can buy yo yo $20k worth of BTT for the sale. Many people think this will be an easy 100x which would put it I believe at 1 cent per BTT
