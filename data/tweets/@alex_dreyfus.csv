11349,2019-06-15 11:20:28+00:00,alex_dreyfus,@Tsxbo @Chiliz @Binance_DEX It will be sent directly in your @Socios wallet.

11351,2019-06-15 09:39:25+00:00,alex_dreyfus,@OurielOhayon I see what you did there.
11352,2019-06-15 09:02:50+00:00,alex_dreyfus,Imagine if Facebook Libra was announced in 2017.

11357,2019-06-15 07:21:19+00:00,alex_dreyfus,@C1aranMurray Same in online gambling industry. There are no American companies in that space.

11362,2019-06-15 06:34:34+00:00,alex_dreyfus,"For those who did work in the online gambling industry, this is the EXACT scenario again. Been there, done that. Adapt or die. Look at today, the most challenged brands few years ago are the most powerful now. Don't bet against Binance."

- Binance to launch a US focus platform: allowing advertising + institutional money, ...

11364,2019-06-14 19:20:27+00:00,alex_dreyfus,@drex_jurassic @CryptoInfinitum @cz_binance They are way ahead ;) not catching up.

11367,2019-06-14 12:49:26+00:00,alex_dreyfus,@Crypto_Tamara @dandabek @Chiliz I know you helped us raised money last year for private placement. That's it. Ended last year. We don't have any commercial/partnership with Startup Nation for anything else than last year :-) Thanks.

11374,2019-06-14 11:17:28+00:00,alex_dreyfus,"It is when time is difficult and that you are challenged, that the best managers are becoming more creative and successful. Look at @Binance Hack and how they handle it perfectly. Now, look at @Bitfinex, same. They are really getting good."

11386,2019-06-14 08:38:10+00:00,alex_dreyfus,@lawmaster Should we put it in a BSV block? :-)

11388,2019-06-14 08:31:45+00:00,alex_dreyfus,@lawmaster and I'm happy to bet on more than 5 pairs of crypto/crypto.

I think crypto/crypto &amp; fiat/crypto is  different topic. I believe (no insider info), that BinanceUS will indeed have few USD pairs, but crypto/crypto should be similar to Bittrex/Kraken/Coinbase."

11393,2019-06-14 08:21:09+00:00,alex_dreyfus,"@lawmaster I disagree again :-) This is driven by the management wanted to perform more successfully in the US. This is not devastating, this is a great opportunity for long-term strategy."
11394,2019-06-14 08:20:01+00:00,alex_dreyfus,@lawmaster I don't agree with all of the assessment re:pairs. Look at Kraken or Bittrex. I don't think their announcement was about FIAT only.
11395,2019-06-14 06:41:33+00:00,alex_dreyfus,"12th of Sept, @binance.com will not accept US users anymore. But you can expect that by that time @BinanceAmerica will be launched.

11449,2019-06-07 13:08:22+00:00,alex_dreyfus,"@CHalexov2016 @BlockShowcom STO are much less cross-borders due to regulations.
I think STO will be a US focus, but not Asia for example.
As @aantonop said, STO are just a new legal word for illegal ICO, but they are still securities -&gt; no innovation, therefore nothing revolutionary."

ICO were big because unregulated and wild west, and high ROI return. STO can't do that."

Then it will be very limited geographically. Also, middle men (promotion, etc...) are regulated too. Last, you need legit businesses."
