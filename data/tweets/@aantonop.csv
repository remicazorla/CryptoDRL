639,2021-03-02 16:43:35+00:00,aantonop,"@Yung__Sharky @Mario_Gibney That's not ""intrinsic"", that's utility value. The value is in the use not in the object intrinsically. 

A hammer and nails are useless to someone in the desert who needs a glass of water. That means the value is not intrinsic. The word ""intrinsic"" means something very specific"

677,2021-02-25 17:32:19+00:00,aantonop,@AIkarenSF The hardware is not important. The important part is the mnemonic phrase (seed) and its backup on a durable medium. You can replace hardware easily with any one of hundreds of implementations of the same standard.

1784,2020-12-25 03:50:01+00:00,aantonop,"Infosec in cryptocurrencies is next-level difficult because the motivation for attack is built in to the system. Every system is a honeypot, even if it is a small honeypot. So every attacker has a direct and obvious payoff.

Still not a good reason to substitute a hardware wallet with a software encrypted USB storage on whatever OS you're on.

But giving bad advice that increases risk is not ok and I will call you out. My goal is to help people reduce risk, not stick it to Ledger."
1791,2020-12-25 03:32:19+00:00,aantonop,"@Open_Media No, an encrypted storage solution can be used to store the key material, but the problem simply shifts to:
a) How do you open/write/read that
b) How do you sign transactions

Both of which are not secure to do in online software/OS, so you're back to needing a hardware wallet."

1) It won't address the past breach risks
2) It fixes the wrong problem (the Ledger HW is fine)
3) It substitutes a hardware wallet for a less secure software wallet

1965,2020-12-21 15:15:07+00:00,aantonop,Given how @Ledger responded to the vulnerability disclosure by @saleemrash1d a couple years ago it is disappointing to see they didn't learn and are handling this (much worse) breach and leak in the same inept way.

2018,2020-12-20 22:31:19+00:00,aantonop,"@pcaversaccio A passphrase is preferable for most use cases. Shamir makes backup strategy more complex, so I would only do that for very large amounts.

2522,2020-11-30 22:35:06+00:00,aantonop,@Gugbrot It's not lost. It's still in the hands of the sender. It never left.

But you can use LN right now if you want. It works pretty well. I have people buying stuff on my shop with LN and yesterday I paid a contractor over LN for a small job."
2524,2020-11-30 21:24:43+00:00,aantonop,"@simplyhansen You should've seen how difficult it was to download stuff over FTP in 1992.

It's the main reason the Internet died."
2525,2020-11-30 20:36:39+00:00,aantonop,"Anyone can make a system cheap and fast. All they do is make it centralized and insecure. 

Of course, they won't tell you about that tradeoff. You won't even see it until someone tries to shut the system down or censor your transactions. 

You'll wish you paid a fee to be free"
2526,2020-11-30 20:34:59+00:00,aantonop,"If you're not choosing priority in a (necessarily) scarce system, then someone else is choosing priority for you. Perhaps they think your application is not important or it is spam. It's either fee markets or software despots. I choose fee markets."
2527,2020-11-30 19:57:23+00:00,aantonop,"If you want to have control over this vital part of the Bitcoin system, you need to carefully choose a wallet that allows you to control these things. A non-custodial wallet where you can set the fee rate, get good estimates and ""bump"" with RBF and CPFP. 

Choose well!"
2528,2020-11-30 19:57:22+00:00,aantonop,"Transaction fees are a complicated topic, but they're part of what makes Bitcoin free and decentralized. No one but you can decide how ""important"" a transaction is. You decide and you tell the miners with your fee choice. 

/19"
2529,2020-11-30 19:57:22+00:00,aantonop,"That also means that sometimes your transaction will get dropped from most places but re-broadcast by nodes that have kept it. That can delay the eventual confirmation/rejection of your Tx, leaving it in limbo longer. 

/18"
2530,2020-11-30 19:57:21+00:00,aantonop,"The queue where transactions are held before confirmation is called ""the mempool"". Thing is however, there is no ""the"" mempool. There is ""a mempool"" on every Bitcoin node. It's a decentralized system. Every node keeps a mempool of waiting transactions. 

/17"
2531,2020-11-30 19:57:21+00:00,aantonop,"That's because the reason the network isn't confirming it is that there are too many transactions queued competing for space. The queue itself is limited in size, so the same thing (congestion) preventing your Tx from confirming is likely to cause it to be dropped faster too.
/16"
2532,2020-11-30 19:57:20+00:00,aantonop,"How long can a transaction stay ""stuck"". If the network remains congested and the fee remains low, it can be up to 14 days before the network drops it and you can see the balance again. ""Up to"" because it usually takes 2-3 days before the network drops your Tx.

/15"
2533,2020-11-30 19:57:20+00:00,aantonop,"The transaction spending hasn't happened until... it has. Before confirmation, you have the money. After confirmation the recipient has the money. A block mined containing your Tx signals the change in state. 

/14"
2534,2020-11-30 19:57:20+00:00,aantonop,"In order to prevent weird user behavior, your wallet will ""hide"" the balance of coins that you have tried to spend with a pending transaction. It will show your balance decreased by that amount. But in reality, the coins are still in your wallet.

/13"
2535,2020-11-30 19:57:19+00:00,aantonop,"Bitcoin transactions are ""atomic"", meaning they are indivisible. The money is not removed from your wallet and sent somewhere before arriving at another wallet. If the transaction isn't confirmed, you have the money. If it is confirmed, the recipient has the money. No limbo

/12"
2536,2020-11-30 19:57:19+00:00,aantonop,"First of all, DON'T PANIC. It's important to understand that in Bitcoin your money can't get lost ""in limbo"". If you create a transaction and it is not getting confirmed, your money is not at risk of being lost. It will either confirm or it won't and your money is safe

/11"
2537,2020-11-30 19:57:18+00:00,aantonop,"Now, you're ready to send a transaction. If you have RBF, pick a low fee and see what happens. Later you can increase the fee and keep increasing it until you get the result you want. But what if you already sent a transaction, without RBF and it got stuck?

/10"
2538,2020-11-30 19:57:18+00:00,aantonop,"Again, good wallets do Replace-By-Fee (RBF) and Child-Pays-For-Parent (CPFP) to help you manage a congested network and not get your Tx stuck. If your wallet doesn't do those things... consider changing wallets. 

/9"
2539,2020-11-30 19:57:17+00:00,aantonop,"Before sending a transaction you should also check if your wallet supports fee ""bumping"" with RBF or CPFP. If you can later ""bump"" the fee up, you can afford to be cheap at first and see if you get lucky. If you can't bump, you run the risk of getting your Tx stuck. 

/8"
2540,2020-11-30 19:57:17+00:00,aantonop,"If you use a wallet that creates ""legacy"" addresses that start with a ""1"", then choose a different wallet and move your money when the network isn't congested. 

Addresses that start with ""3"" (wrapped Segwit) are better. Those that start with ""bc1"" (native Segwit)  are best

/7"
2541,2020-11-30 19:57:16+00:00,aantonop,"If your wallet doesn't allow you to estimate fees or its fee estimation seems to be too conservative, use a different wallet. Another big reason for high fees is legacy address use. Different bitcoin addresses cost up to 40% less in fees for the sender. 

/6"
2542,2020-11-30 19:57:16+00:00,aantonop,"Some wallets won't let you set the fee rate or confirmation target. Some wallets also estimate fees very conservatively and aggressively overpay fees. That's because if your transaction is stuck you complain to the wallet devs. If you overpay fees you blame the bitcoin devs

/5"
2543,2020-11-30 19:57:16+00:00,aantonop,"At a current fee rate, you might have to pay 0.0002 BTC or so to get your transaction confirmed within 3 blocks. That's for a typical sized transaction. 

/4"
2544,2020-11-30 19:57:15+00:00,aantonop,"Transaction fees are measured in satoshis per virtual byte (vbyte). Different transaction types have different sizes, depending on the complexity, number of inputs/outputs and address type being spent. 

A typical size (one input, two outputs) is about 144 vB. 

/3"
2545,2020-11-30 19:57:15+00:00,aantonop,"First, check and see how congested things are. A great site for this is Johoe's Bitcoin Mempool statistics:

https://t.co/geFf63lldz

That rising mountain is 6hrs of activity. There are already 30,000 transactions willing to pay more than 50 satoshis per byte

2880,2020-10-22 02:01:08+00:00,aantonop,"@Adelgary @TowerOBable @piramida @ntnchez @lopp Agreed, I don't think it is trivial. It would require significant coordination and most likely a hard-fork (even more coordination). It's doable, but not easy. 

Easier in L2, where for example LN uses milli-satoshis. Still rounded up on channel closure, but useful for payments"
2881,2020-10-22 01:56:30+00:00,aantonop,"@TowerOBable @Adelgary @piramida @ntnchez @lopp There may be a way to do this that is backwards-compatible with non-upgraded nodes (soft), but I don't see it. Then again, many were surprised with Luke-Jr's invention of a way to soft-fork Segwit and avoid a hard fork. Who know what someone might come up with?"
2882,2020-10-22 01:54:42+00:00,aantonop,@TowerOBable @Adelgary @piramida @ntnchez @lopp Not exactly. A soft fork allows existing (unapgraded) nodes to continue following the chain: it is a narrowing of the rules. This is likely a hard fork because it would be an expansion of the validation rules to allow a bigger vout value field or new Tx version number

2969,2020-09-21 16:10:51+00:00,aantonop,@shiva_yb I won't become a maximalist or exclude the broader audience who needs to understand the stakes. I mentioned Bitcoin as the primary example of these principles but not to the exclusion of the broader ecosystem. I always choose words carefully and in service to my principles.
2970,2020-09-21 13:56:15+00:00,aantonop,"@ethlongmusk That's exactly how FinCen as a concept works. If we don't notice their failures they are victorious. When we find out they're failing completely, they just need a bit more power and control - ad infinitum because the battle isn't meant to/ can't be won, it's a power grab."
2971,2020-09-21 13:53:57+00:00,aantonop,"@gonzoucab To varying degrees, yes. None of these characteristics are binary metrics. Even Bitcoin needs improvements in fungibility &amp; privacy, areas where other systems are better. But other cryptocurrencies lack the robustness and liquidity.

a) Bitcoin is the only system ever with these properties
b) Bitcoin doesn't have it's own issues that need to be addressed.

2977,2020-09-21 13:14:58+00:00,aantonop,This isn't good news. This is the excuse they will use to double down on surveillance and control. To make money a tool of naked political power. No matter how many billions these measures condemn to poverty.
2978,2020-09-21 13:14:57+00:00,aantonop,"The solution is to stop trying to use money (a tool) to fight crime (human nature). But if you think the hypocrites will back down and adopt sensible systems and laws that enable human trade and economic inclusion, you are wrong. They will double down with even more control"
2979,2020-09-21 13:14:57+00:00,aantonop,"This FinCen leak is worthy of our ridicule because it reveals the hypocrisy of those who argue that crypto-currency is for money launderers. Banking *is* money laundering on a massive scale. But the solution is not to tighten controls on money. That won't work

2980,2020-09-21 13:14:56+00:00,aantonop,"The only type of money (crypto) that poor, undocumented, oppressed, and controlled populations can use will of course be attacked. But they will not have any choice but to continue to use cryptocurrency. Billions are already unbanked by fiat controls. 

14/"
2981,2020-09-21 13:14:56+00:00,aantonop,"Then the war on cash and the war on ""illicit"" money becomes an all out war on the only money that still works. The free, open, borderless, neutral, immutable, censorship resistant money that crypto-currencies like Bitcoin offer

2984,2020-09-21 13:14:54+00:00,aantonop,"Then of course, the need and value of open financial systems based on open, private, and uncensorable cryptocurrencies will increase dramatically. When all the money in the world has been deliberately broken to serve this unachievable goal, the only money that works is crypto

2985,2020-09-21 13:14:54+00:00,aantonop,"These new rules will make government surveillance worse and will erode democratic institutions.

2990,2020-09-21 13:14:52+00:00,aantonop,"I've talked about this extensively. Not only is the use of money as a crime-control mechanism ineffective, it has terrible consequences that increase poverty for billions by creating economic exclusion. So it's not just useless, it is ""Worse than Useless""

3/"
2991,2020-09-21 12:55:16+00:00,aantonop,"See the correct analysis of this news is that AML/CTF and KYC don't work. They will never work because they try to control the *tool* not the *criminal act*. It's not the money that is illicit, it's the use of that money to commit crimes.

3257,2020-08-10 18:04:48+00:00,aantonop,"On top of all that you have to scan the blockchain to create a correct current state, based on the mining rewards. All of which means that there is NUANCE to this question.

3262,2020-08-10 17:54:46+00:00,aantonop,"Ok I lied, it's 3 purposes -

/11"
3263,2020-08-10 17:54:46+00:00,aantonop,"(2) It acts as a sort of on-chain mining pool mechanism, since it doesn't penalize second-finish miners with a zero reward. This makes lower-hashrate miners able to compete as solo miners without losing potential reward

/10"
3264,2020-08-10 17:54:45+00:00,aantonop,"This mechanism serves two purposes: 

(1) it allows much faster block times (40x of bitcoin), without creating a whole mess of stale blocks that get no reward. Ethereum doesn't discard stales, it rewards them

/9"
3265,2020-08-10 17:48:27+00:00,aantonop,"This is a critical point to understand: ETH supply issued as rewards doesn't go 100% to the winning block each confirmation. In Ethereum, up to 87% of the block reward goes to uncles, and some is further distributed to nephews (children of uncles). Part also goes to the parent
/8"
3266,2020-08-10 17:48:26+00:00,aantonop,"Then there are ""uncles"". In Bitcoin, PoW is a winner-takes-all mechanism. Not in Ethereum, which uses a Greedy Heaviest Observed Tree (GHOST) protocol to include stale blocks with a lower reward. These are caller ""uncles"" or ""ommers""

/7"
3267,2020-08-10 17:44:05+00:00,aantonop,"Bitcoin does 1 block every 10 minutes. Ethereum does ~40 in that time. So exactly when you ask the question, will determine what answer you get. It won't be a stable answer for 10 minutes, it will change every 15-30 seconds or so. 

/6"
3268,2020-08-10 17:38:53+00:00,aantonop,"You can easily see how this plays out in Bitcoin too, if you've paid any attention to all the errors in popular blockchain explorers over the years.

3586,2020-07-15 19:51:22+00:00,aantonop,"@annkur Not a Twitter API, an application that many companies use that is authorized to post via their Twitter API credentials. Something like a marketing/social-media aggregator. I don't want to name names without evidence."

3608,2020-07-11 12:39:25+00:00,aantonop,"@CryptoCrazy79 @mezie16 Simple answer: You can't prevent crime from happening using money as the crime-fighting tool. Attempting to do so creates bigger and worse criminals and doesn't work to stop crime. 

Criminals have private and untraceable money. The only question is will you and I also have it?"
3609,2020-07-11 00:53:33+00:00,aantonop,"@fsosamelgar @brucefenton You're using an appeal to emotion, which in fact reveals the real problem with AML/CFT: It is trivially bypassed by the state-level entities that fund terrorism, by the banks owned by narcos, by the intelligence agencies. 

Meanwhile your useless regs push billions into poverty"
3610,2020-07-11 00:51:30+00:00,aantonop,"@fsosamelgar @brucefenton That is an incredibly dishonest argument. AML/CFT wouldn't prevent 9/11. 

Terrorism is mostly funded by state-level entities. 9/11 had funding from the Saudis, but less than 20 years earlier AQ was ""mujahedeen"" funded by the CIA against the Russians. 

AML? Bullshit

Don't lie."
3611,2020-07-10 21:05:23+00:00,aantonop,@NashAmbassadors Disagree. You can earn BTC instead of buying it. Informal economies don't do KYC. The world runs on informal economies. Adoption is not going to happen in the 1st world by those who already have banking and don't need crypto.
3612,2020-07-10 21:02:00+00:00,aantonop,"@fefolamas @mezie16 LND? It might be related to the height_hint_cache issue that I ran into. There's a fix in the latest release, an option that disables the cache and rescans the blockchain to get it unstuck"
3613,2020-07-10 20:51:40+00:00,aantonop,"@mezie16 Ad hominem. I'm not a maximalist and you can't dismiss the pragmatic argument with moralistic arguments that don't actually solve the problem, or by presenting my position as some kind of extremist/radical position. 

No one disagrees that evil exists. AML adds more evil not less"
3614,2020-07-10 20:49:20+00:00,aantonop,"@NashAmbassadors They always have had and will continue to have the ability to move money privately. 

They own banks, bankers, and governments. They don't need a DEX. They have HSBC, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo."
3615,2020-07-10 20:47:55+00:00,aantonop,"@fsosamelgar @brucefenton Don't disagree. But AML regs make the drug problem much WORSE, not better. It actually forces innocent people into poverty where they can be exploited by drug lords, while doing nothing to stop the drug money flows. 

End the drug wars."
3616,2020-07-10 18:14:13+00:00,aantonop,"@jordan_wentzell @quikflip757 It's necessary for the preservation of banking cartels and the centralization of power and surveillance in the hands of a few oligarchs who don't really believe in democracy. It's not necessary for the stated purpose, but it is necessary once you see its real purpose: power."
3617,2020-07-10 18:12:12+00:00,aantonop,"@qShaneDouglas I've never advocated for a stateless system. I think governance is best when it is hyper-local, focused, respectful of civil rights and not too powerful. I am against centralized, massive, overbearing, unaccountable governance without consent."
3618,2020-07-10 18:00:45+00:00,aantonop,"@quikflip757 It's exactly like that, if you believe in ""let them eat cake"". 

Rules for little people, that help control them while selling them the lie that it is for their own good. Meanwhile, the important people don't need to concern themselves with such silly rules."
3619,2020-07-10 17:59:03+00:00,aantonop,"@mezie16 Don't be fooled. The rich, the criminals and especially the rich criminals already have and have always had financial privacy. They can afford it. These rules are for the little people, for the little crimes.

3623,2020-07-10 17:01:19+00:00,aantonop,"@mezie16 Disagree. KYC AML empowers the criminals with banking license and the criminals in government, while doing very little to stop crime. It just elevates crime to a licensed activity. 

Surveillance of everyone's finances *is* fascism and creates worse criminals who are in charge"

AML and KYC don't work and result in massive harm to billions of people. You don't need to get rid of the state. Just abolish these relatively recent (1970s) ""innovations"" in state power, surveillance and control."

4323,2020-04-18 19:53:20+00:00,aantonop,@nano_private Nodes play an important role. They can (partially) override miners by not propagating transactions or blocks that violate consensus.

You seem to think I'm enriching myself at the expense of people who support me through Patreon.

Regardless, I don't what you think I shilled. I haven't promoted any investment or sold my reputation. In fact Patreon allows me to be neutral."

2. Prior leaks have shown that when we are prevented from knowing, the ""interpretation"" far surpasses the, already abusive, law. It will be far worse than you can even imagine."

You got your choice in SV and we can test both hypotheses independently."
6929,2019-02-03 23:41:31+00:00,aantonop,"@kurtwuckertjr @MJTraderPro Bitcoin can handle exponential demand, but it has to scale off-chain. At which point it also has to scale on-chain."
6930,2019-02-03 23:40:14+00:00,aantonop,"@MMosiuc @kurtwuckertjr @MJTraderPro Increase in adoption = increase in transactions. 

If there's no increase in adoption, there's no need for LN or even bitcoin."
6931,2019-02-03 23:33:44+00:00,aantonop,"@kurtwuckertjr @MJTraderPro Why are you assuming that the number of transactions won't grow dramatically, even if LN scales the off-chain capability. Fees will become a bigger part of the reward than the block subsidy, with or without LN. LN just open up a whole other level of scale. Miners will be fine"
6932,2019-02-03 23:21:36+00:00,aantonop,"@daysofwaves If you can successfully memorize it, great. I can (somewhat) with 12-word seeds, but not with 24-word seeds (so far). You can use memorization in addition to&gt;1 paper backup, not instead."
6933,2019-02-03 23:19:29+00:00,aantonop,"@MJTraderPro No, that's not the case. LN simply magnifies on-chain capacity by allowing more transactions to happen off-chain. It still needs on-chain transactions to open and close channels. Even if channels are long lived, they will require re-balancing from time to time."
6934,2019-02-03 23:17:59+00:00,aantonop,@_peterparker503 I believe you have the torch ;-)
6935,2019-02-03 23:11:25+00:00,aantonop,"@jpthor__ @MJTraderPro Well, yes, but re-balancing will most likely also involve splice-in/splice-out transactions on-chain, at least some of the time. So there will be ""closing"" transactions, only to open other channels in the same transaction, for re-balancing"

7108,2019-01-04 14:45:13+00:00,aantonop,@SaleemUsama @saifedean That is a problem when you have a couple thousand followers. But exposure to new ideas is not reduced by blocking after a certain scale. Even vigorous blocking barely makes any change in the flow of ideas. It just removes the noisiest.
