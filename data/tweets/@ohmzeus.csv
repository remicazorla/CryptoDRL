1,2022-12-31 17:18:00+00:00,ohmzeus,"meanwhile most assets have fared the same fate but with no way to generate liquidity even at steep markdowns, and thus nothing to prevent those markdowns from worsening"
2,2022-12-31 17:18:00+00:00,ohmzeus,"people seem to forget that the whole point of the (3, 3) equilibrium is to allow the protocol to raise its treasury

so that when external liquidity dries up and the equilibrium flips to (-3, -3), the protocol can provide from within

the past 8 months have shown that this works"
3,2022-12-31 17:17:59+00:00,ohmzeus,"OHM stands out from the pack because it relies on (3, 3) for growth but not survival

21,2022-11-25 22:39:17+00:00,ohmzeus,"@WartuII Should risk be more willing to sit in OHM market than something else, and thus redevelop EV is a different question and one I‚Äôm not really gonna try to answer"
22,2022-11-25 22:38:23+00:00,ohmzeus,@WartuII To access liquidity from IB you have to push into discount though
23,2022-11-25 22:37:28+00:00,ohmzeus,"@Nach_211 @WartuII Rn growth prospect is low so sailing with the wind means optimizing against vol, whereas if it were high it‚Äôd be the opposite"
24,2022-11-25 22:36:41+00:00,ohmzeus,"@Nach_211 @WartuII In an ideal world I think rn is demonstration that, when you remove most of the risk, low vol is pretty achievable

But a future expansion operates more like pre-RBS

Kinda two states: growth at expense of stability, or stability at expense of growth"
25,2022-11-25 22:29:24+00:00,ohmzeus,"@WartuII could also argue theres material benefit to pushing into discount/negative EV state if you want liquidity (treasury will kick in)

compare to BTC or something -- not much assurance you'd unlock more liquidity even if you knock it lower, so higher incentive to just wait/do nothing"
26,2022-11-25 22:28:06+00:00,ohmzeus,@WartuII i think the last q highlights that risk extends a bit beyond IV (gotta consider smart contracts etc too) so ultra-low risk appetite paired with that and ig you get a negative EV
27,2022-11-25 22:21:03+00:00,ohmzeus,@WAGMIcapital actually believing in efficient markets is bold though so
28,2022-11-25 22:20:35+00:00,ohmzeus,"@WAGMIcapital rather you'll end up with higher demand with higher emissions, or lower demand with lower emissions, at the same price

idea being that market is moving to correct value and more or less capital will come in to get it there depending on whats needed

deviations are transient"
29,2022-11-25 22:19:08+00:00,ohmzeus,"@WAGMIcapital ya i was thinking about this too, especially with regard to emissions

when we look at OHM emissions, or ETH

there's sometimes the assumption that higher/lower emissions will have material impact on pricing

but efficient mkt hypo would tell you they don't"

32,2022-11-25 21:52:36+00:00,ohmzeus,"there's some evidence to support that

I always found it weird that OHM seemed to lead majors through '21 (maybe still but vol is a lot lower now so its harder to tell)

I wrote it off bc how tf would it be? but maybe they all price risk and we just saw changes faster

20/"
33,2022-11-25 21:52:36+00:00,ohmzeus,"because its the only hybrid, I actually think OHM does the best job measuring this

it reflected the change in risk first, but everything reflected it eventually. *potentially*, it was simply the fastest and most efficient in doing so

19/"
34,2022-11-25 21:52:36+00:00,ohmzeus,"i'll just throw in that this dynamic only exists for OHM because its the only one (that I know of/excluding forks) with both extrinsic and intrinsic value

i.e. USDC has intrinsic value, BTC/ETH have extrinsic value, OHM has both

18/"
35,2022-11-25 21:52:35+00:00,ohmzeus,"at minimum I find this really fascinating, especially considering October-December '21 implied risk was realized with a high degree of precision

not to say it had to be realized (look at cases where it wasn't), but the reading is accurate a year later

17/"
36,2022-11-25 21:52:35+00:00,ohmzeus,"is this real?

tbh I do not know (its a theory), but confirmation to me would be seeing this dynamic persist if/when risk returns to crypto and the broader global economy

16/"
37,2022-11-25 21:52:35+00:00,ohmzeus,"what about since then?

well, risk has not returned. things have gotten worse, not better. so, implied risk sits in a negative state. imo this is indicative of the severity of the current environment (which you can also see in low liq on majors, etc)

15/"
38,2022-11-25 21:52:34+00:00,ohmzeus,"the appetite for risk dried up across the board, and implied risk reflected it

14/"
39,2022-11-25 21:52:34+00:00,ohmzeus,"what happened from the end of 2021 onwards?

well, the fed (signaled, then) raised rates, and risk got repriced pretty significantly. then war in ukraine, 3ac/luna blowup, you know the rest of the story 

13/"
40,2022-11-25 21:52:34+00:00,ohmzeus,"what about 2021 highs?

12/"
41,2022-11-25 21:52:33+00:00,ohmzeus,"as the project matured, risk tolerance decreased but still stayed within rational crypto bounds

both 2021 lows were marked by implied risk falling to ~80%. this happens to be roughly Bitcoin's drawdown to date. so, imo, fair to say 80% = low risk in a bull mkt context

11/"
42,2022-11-25 21:52:33+00:00,ohmzeus,"i'll provide my interpretation of this:

at launch, risk tolerance was 100%. this makes sense: there's a good chance any new project just goes to zero bc of a hack or rug or whatever. thus a very large premium developed

10/"
43,2022-11-25 21:52:32+00:00,ohmzeus,"finding our implied risk from this is pretty easy

we just do (1 / multiple) - 1

I also inverted that (*-1) to make it a bit easier to view

average implied risk looks like this:

44,2022-11-25 21:52:31+00:00,ohmzeus,"the cool thing is there's data we can use to visualize this

the three charts below show: EV multiple based on RFV; EV multiple based on treasury mark-to-market value, and EV multiple based on an average of the two

we'll focus on the third since it dispels some nuance

45,2022-11-25 21:52:30+00:00,ohmzeus,"if aggregate risk tolerance is less than 50%, asks are going to keep piling up until EV falls and risk is lower

if agg risk tolerance is greater than 50%, bids will pile on until EV rises and risk is higher

7/"
46,2022-11-25 21:52:29+00:00,ohmzeus,"consider the case where EV = IV. so MV is double IV (backing). i.e. backing is $10 and OHM trades for $20.

at this point in time, OHM implies 50% risk. a return to backing would mean MV2 = MV1 / 2

bids at this level are ok with that risk, asks are not

6/"
47,2022-11-25 21:52:29+00:00,ohmzeus,"i think this interpretation could be accurate over short timeframes but misses the picture over longer timeframes

my explanation is that extrinsic value is a measurement of risk tolerance

5/"
48,2022-11-25 21:52:28+00:00,ohmzeus,"why would it be one versus the other?

the simplest explanation is its random. someone apes, number go up, EV increases; someone dumps, number go down, EV decreases

a little more nuanced is its random but momentum driven -- ape begets ape, dump begets dump

4/"
49,2022-11-25 21:52:28+00:00,ohmzeus,"if MV goes up, EV goes up; vice versa

EV can be positive (when OHM is at a premium) or negative (when at a discount)

3/"
50,2022-11-25 21:52:28+00:00,ohmzeus,"first, let's lay out the three relevant variables

MV = IV + EV, where MV is market value (price), IV is intrinsic (treasury) value, and EV is extrinsic value

IV and MV are independent variables (where MV is more volatile). EV is a dependent variable

51,2022-11-25 21:52:27+00:00,ohmzeus,"the understanding I have landed on is that OHM measures risk tolerance in its (and possibly the larger crypto) market

Here are some docs: https://t.co/TgE8ayMp3L

Here's the pool: https://t.co/3VBDWamotJ

Let me emphasize: THIS IS NOT AUDITED. USE ONLY AT YOUR OWN RISK. THIS CONTRACT IS EXPERIMENTAL."
709,2021-10-25 22:35:05+00:00,ohmzeus,"note: 0%-15% ranges allow volume from tokens with low LP exposure.

We will use this pool as a testing ground. I hope we can prove this model, then propose it as a treasury strategy for Olympus."
710,2021-10-25 22:35:04+00:00,ohmzeus,"This is unlike existing stablecoin yield opportunities where you have some undefined level of exposure to various stablecoins, and generally take on 100% of their downside (if any token in a curve or v3 pool loses peg, LPs end up with only that token)."
711,2021-10-25 22:35:03+00:00,ohmzeus,RangePool will allow Olympus to productively deploy its reserves in an isolated environment where its exposure to different assets is defined and controlled.
712,2021-10-25 22:35:03+00:00,ohmzeus,"This started as a treasury allocation strategy for @OlympusDAO, and I see them as the largest beneficiary.

Olympus has no concept of impermanent loss between stablecoins. It already treats 1 DAI as equal to 1 LUSD, and so it can never lose when allowing 1:1 swaps between them."
713,2021-10-25 22:35:02+00:00,ohmzeus,"Consider the following:

The $10m TVL Range Pool can do a $3m trade from DAI to LUSD. The price between DAI and LUSD rises from 1.00 to 1.01. An arbitrageur can buy $3m LUSD from the RP and sell it for $3.03m on curve. In the process, the RP made a fee on 30% of its TVL."
714,2021-10-25 22:35:02+00:00,ohmzeus,"What's the usecase?

My expectation is that (at least early on) the pool swings  from range extreme to range extreme as the pooled tokens fluctuate around peg. This should produce heavy fee volume from arbitrage"
715,2021-10-25 22:35:01+00:00,ohmzeus,"What's the downside?

- &lt;24/7 uptime. If a token is at its upper bound, you won't be able to add it or swap in with it. Unlike curve, you won't always be able to make the trade you want to here.
- IL, depending on what you consider IL

This is pretty much all I can think of."
716,2021-10-25 22:35:01+00:00,ohmzeus,"Why is this helpful?

- Perfect execution (trades are always 1:1 minus fee)
- Gas efficient (simple logic == low fees)
- Capital efficient (large portions of the pool are accessible for trading)
- Risk definition (you know, to the %, how exposed you are to each token in the pool)"
717,2021-10-25 22:35:00+00:00,ohmzeus,"Each token has one of these ranges. As long as whatever token you want to swap in/add, or swap out/remove stays within the range, you can do it."
718,2021-10-25 22:35:00+00:00,ohmzeus,"Instead of creating a pricing curve, tokens simply must remain within a pre-defined range.

For example, the range for DAI in this first pool is 20%-70%. DAI must remain at least 20% of the pool, and no more than 70%.

Any trade that would take it out of this range is rejected."
719,2021-10-25 22:34:59+00:00,ohmzeus,"The fundamental idea, to abandon a pricing curve altogether, sounds kind of stupid when you first hear it. At least that's what I thought coming up with it. But the more you think about it, the more it makes sense."
720,2021-10-25 22:34:59+00:00,ohmzeus,"Range is a stablecoin swap protocol that creates Range Pools.

Range Pools make the optimistic assumption that tokens in the pool are always worth the same amount, and therefore always allows trades at a perfect 1:1"
721,2021-10-25 22:34:58+00:00,ohmzeus,"Introducing Range, an optimistic stablecoin swap protocol.

789,2021-10-12 18:59:14+00:00,ohmzeus,"@TychoOnnasch @Calvin_0x @scupytrooples a big deterrent should end up being that, if you do choose to fork instead of use OP, you are burning a bridge with Olympus

is escaping a nominal fee paid in your gov token worth the added overhead and lost opportunity for support from Olympus? that is the question"
790,2021-10-12 18:51:51+00:00,ohmzeus,@statelayer yeah exactly
791,2021-10-12 18:02:20+00:00,ohmzeus,"You don't need to be plugged in to the DAO or even the community (though we'd love to be frens); just make some good faith gestures, demonstrate legitimacy, tell the ohmies what you need, and see what they say https://t.co/0TUhWgTh2w"
792,2021-10-12 18:02:18+00:00,ohmzeus,"If that does prove to be the case, first movers will have a huge advantage. So what are you waiting for anon? 

Utilize OHM as the currency its meant to be. Join the econohmy."
793,2021-10-12 18:02:18+00:00,ohmzeus,"There's even a non-zero probability outcome that pairing with OHM becomes almost compulsory. The more liquidity we consume, the higher the cost of capital becomes outside of the econohmy and the cheaper it becomes inside the econohmy."
794,2021-10-12 18:02:17+00:00,ohmzeus,"Remember, Olympus also owns the liquidity rails and takes fees on anything routed through them. This allows it to capture and retain financial energy better than comparable systems."
795,2021-10-12 18:02:17+00:00,ohmzeus,"All of this is currently theoretical because it hasn't been done yet, but this should create a virtuous cycle.

growth in econohmic activity -&gt; diminished macroeconohmic risk -&gt; heightened opportunity cost -&gt; growth in econohmic activity"
796,2021-10-12 18:02:16+00:00,ohmzeus,Olympus isn't really doing anything new here. It is and will be accumulating assets anyways. The only difference is the risk it takes on (which should always be systemically insignificant) and the positive externalities it creates.
797,2021-10-12 18:02:16+00:00,ohmzeus,This is favorable to Project X because their cost of capital diminishes. This is favorable to Olympus because Project X brings new activity and capital into the econohmy (it's cost of capital is also likely lower since it produces more circular econohmic activity)
798,2021-10-12 18:02:15+00:00,ohmzeus,"The DAO, favorable to the project, agrees to commit x OHM toward bonds, and ends up owning 20% of the pool. An insignificant amount relative to its total liquidity holdings, but quite significant for Project X"
799,2021-10-12 18:02:15+00:00,ohmzeus,"If their need outweighs their ability, they then approach Olympus. Project X has already demonstrated alignment by incentivizing and accumulating an sOHM pool, and so they ask the DAO for assistance."
800,2021-10-12 18:02:14+00:00,ohmzeus,"Here's something I can see happening frequently in the future. [warning: this is only a hypothesis]

Project X launches liquidity mining rewards for sOHM-X.
They utilize Olympus Pro to accumulate that liquidity, to whatever degree their tokenomics demand and can accomodate"
801,2021-10-12 18:02:14+00:00,ohmzeus,"This is a very specific tokenomic setup though. Not everyone can do this. 

The good thing is you don't have to."
802,2021-10-12 18:02:13+00:00,ohmzeus,"This is why yields are crazy high on OHM. The protocol is aggressively accumulating assets, and compensates for it by increasing the balances of those staked. This minimizes dilution, creating an economically viable model despite the high short term costs."
803,2021-10-12 18:02:13+00:00,ohmzeus,"This is a difficult thing to balance. If you have a $100m market cap and want to accumulate $10m liquidity, you need to spend 10% current circulating supply. This means almost 10% dilution for current holders."
804,2021-10-12 18:02:12+00:00,ohmzeus,"The problem is that buying liquidity is more expensive in the short term than renting liquidity. 

This cost is in the form of new tokens, which dilute current holders to the benefit of future holders."
805,2021-10-12 18:02:12+00:00,ohmzeus,"It seems like everyone is in favor of, at least, protocol owned liquidity. Given it is properly executed, this is a viable solution to the liquidity mining problem."
806,2021-10-12 18:02:11+00:00,ohmzeus,"One take ive seen is ""I get why other protocols would benefit from owning liquidity but I don't see why Olympus needs to exist""

I think the fact that others benefit is exactly why. it kind of goes along with this üëáüßµ

1183,2021-06-13 20:05:57+00:00,ohmzeus,"For those interested in playing, today @OlympusDAO will offer FRAX-OHM bonds for the first time as part of a partnership with @fraxfinance.

This will be our third bond type, and it will add an additional layer that I am excited to see the effects of."
1184,2021-06-13 20:05:56+00:00,ohmzeus,"I look forward to seeing the accumulation game develop as more players learn the rules and start playing.

Few understand how mining underpins PoW systems, and fewer understand how bonding underpins PoR systems."
1185,2021-06-13 20:05:56+00:00,ohmzeus,"The overall goal of bonds is to build the strength (capitalization) of the network. Just like $BTC and $ETH derive value from their security, $OHM derives value from its reserves.

As of today, 3 months in, that capitalization sits at $5.5m realized and $17.5m net assets."
1186,2021-06-13 20:05:56+00:00,ohmzeus,"This means that, like mining, bonds will scale to the underlying market.

$OHM price moving up means more room for bonds and, as a result, a larger treasury, just like $BTC price moving up means more room for miners and, as a result, a more secure network."
1187,2021-06-13 20:05:55+00:00,ohmzeus,"Like mining, bonds are competitive. There is not room for everyone. 

If 2x the hashrate come online in PoW, the cost of production per coin doubles. If 2x the capital come online in PoR, the cost of bonds doubles."
1188,2021-06-13 20:05:55+00:00,ohmzeus,"This creates a whole new element. Not only is the basic game the same, the players also get to work together to build something long lasting.

Miners are like Sisyphus pushing the boulder up a hill.
Bonders are like Ictinus building the Parthenon."
1189,2021-06-13 20:05:55+00:00,ohmzeus,"Unlike PoW, where benefit exists at only one point in time, the benefits of PoR are persistent and can only grow.

Once capital is in the treasury, it is in the treasury. Even if everyone stopped bonding, it would still be in the treasury."
1190,2021-06-13 20:05:54+00:00,ohmzeus,"This means that it looks remarkably similar for the participant (spend $__ to receive __ coins), but it looks completely different for the protocol."
1191,2021-06-13 20:05:54+00:00,ohmzeus,"Unlike Proof of Work mining, where capital is spent on equipment and other costs with transient benefit, with Proof of Reserve that capital is given directly to the protocol."
1192,2021-06-13 20:05:54+00:00,ohmzeus,"A PoR network accrues value through bonds, like PoW networks accrue value through mining.

Bonds allow participants to share in seigniorage profits by providing new assets to the treasury."
1193,2021-06-13 20:05:53+00:00,ohmzeus,"So, what is Proof of Reserve and how is it different?

A Proof of Reserve network is one that derives value from protocol owned reserves. The security of the network is in the capitalization of the treasury, and its ability to influence and support its tokens' market."
1194,2021-06-13 20:05:53+00:00,ohmzeus,"Just to get this out of the way, a Proof of Reserve system like @OlympusDAO has the benefit of living on top of an already-secured network (Ethereum). 

We don't need to pay actual miners because we build on the application layer, not the infrastructural layer."
1195,2021-06-13 20:05:52+00:00,ohmzeus,"To review, before we go further:

- Mining secures PoW networks
- Miners mine for seigniorage profits
- Mining has perpetual costs
- The benefit of mining is ephemeral and impermanent"
1196,2021-06-13 20:05:52+00:00,ohmzeus,"For example, as a thought experiment, imagine every ethereum miner decides to turn off their machines tomorrow. What would happen?

The security of the network would drop to zero is what would happen. It wouldn't matter that it WAS secure, it needs to BE secure."
1197,2021-06-13 20:05:51+00:00,ohmzeus,"Mining costs are perpetual. Electricity is gone once it's used, equipment depreciates and needs to be replaced, etc. 

The benefit of mining is also transient; the utility is only at a specific point in time."
1198,2021-06-13 20:05:51+00:00,ohmzeus,"Just because they don't pay anyone, doesn't mean they don't pay.

There are input costs associated with mining.

You need to buy rigs, pay for electricity, set up a data center with adequate cooling, etc. Block rewards certainly aren't free."
1199,2021-06-13 20:05:50+00:00,ohmzeus,"Miners receive dilutionary shares of the network at the cost of production. 

They pay no one for them and they mark no one else up in acquiring them. 

For an accumulator, these are the best kind of shares."
1200,2021-06-13 20:05:50+00:00,ohmzeus,"It is important to note that miners are incentivized with new dilutionary tokens. Their profits are colloquially referred to as ""seigniorage.""

Seigniorage is the difference in the face value of money, such as a $0.25 quarter coin, and the cost to produce it."
1201,2021-06-13 20:05:50+00:00,ohmzeus,"Miners are profit motivated actors, just like everyone else. They only do the work of securing the network because they get paid to do it."
1202,2021-06-13 20:05:50+00:00,ohmzeus,"Generally, mining is talked about from the point of view of the protocol (at least from what I see). People will say the purpose of mining is to secure the network, and it is: for the protocol.

For the miner, the point is not to secure the network. The point is to make money."
1203,2021-06-13 20:05:49+00:00,ohmzeus,"Proof of work mining is pretty well understood at this point

Miners use computers that solve math problems to earn block rewards: new tokens minted by the protocol

Bitcoin has been around for over 12 years now. During that time, it has gone from a super volatile, super well-performing asset to...a slightly-less volatile, still well-performing asset

1294,2021-05-26 19:42:07+00:00,ohmzeus,"Tl;dr

- Non sovereign currency narrative is dying because existing attempts have failed
- They've failed because they don't try
- A non-sovereign currency needs a non-sovereign central bank
- A currency with a decentralized bank has the best chance of replacing stablecoins"

Our focus now shifts from strengthening the present market to securing the future market"
1363,2021-04-20 18:01:03+00:00,ohmzeus,"13/21 - No! It means something has gone right

We're reaching a point of protocol owned liquidity where, though it will always be important and we will always accumulate, we don't need to focus so heavily on it

It's a matter of priorities; and priorities change based on scarcity"
1364,2021-04-20 18:01:03+00:00,ohmzeus,"12/21 - With the introduction of DAI bonds, we will be reducing the role of liquidity bonds (at least for now)

You may wonder, doesn't that mean something is going wrong?"
1365,2021-04-20 18:01:02+00:00,ohmzeus,"11/21 - Those bonds also lock more funds in the treasury, and build up more rewards for stakers

Both of these inspire more confidence in the protocol and drive more demand, helping the growth cycle continue"
1366,2021-04-20 18:01:02+00:00,ohmzeus,"10/21 - Liquidity bonds assist immensely here as well. Spikes generally get sold to roll over bonds (sell OHM to create more LP)

This has the effect of bringing price back to the range. But the range is now more liquid. It becomes harder and harder to move out of it"
1367,2021-04-20 18:01:01+00:00,ohmzeus,"9/21 - Why does this matter?

Well, its much easier to stick to and stabilize in a range when everyone agrees that that should be the range

A positive trading environment forms; people will dip buy the lows and spike sell the highs, protecting the range"
1368,2021-04-20 18:01:01+00:00,ohmzeus,"8/21 - This dynamic compounds with new bond markets

We have more and more prices (market price + staking yield, LP yield - reduced risk, LP bond price, DAI bond price, etc) all working to converge on the same number

We're forcing the market to come to a consensus on price"
1369,2021-04-20 18:01:01+00:00,ohmzeus,"7/21 - This makes every bond market a derivative of $OHM

They function similar to futures; bonds are generally bought when the bond price is lower than market price minus expected yield for the term

Even at under a $100m market cap, an efficient market seems to be forming"
1370,2021-04-20 18:01:00+00:00,ohmzeus,"6/21 - The most important of those characteristics are their pricing mechanism

Bonds trade without any market data. No price feed, no oracles, nothing

Instead, prices are derived from their demand. More demand = higher price; less demand = lower price"
1371,2021-04-20 18:01:00+00:00,ohmzeus,"5/21 - Bonds have several characteristics that are beneficial to our currency aspirations

Even at such a small state, they've exhibited an ability to manifest shockingly consistent price action"
1372,2021-04-20 18:01:00+00:00,ohmzeus,"4/21 - Bonds arose from a larger emphasis on liquidity, and a search for mechanisms to accumulate it

Through that search, I feel like I stumbled upon a seriously powerful mechanism"

1793,2020-12-07 22:58:40+00:00,ohmzeus,"Due to the scarce nature of Bitcoin and its price history, this actually would accelerate as time goes on.

1794,2020-12-07 22:57:25+00:00,ohmzeus,"At the end of 3 you repeat. As long as you have access to loans near the base interest rate, this cycle can repeat indefinitely. 

Collateral is worth more, borrow more, buy more, collateral becomes worth more, borrow more, buy more."
1795,2020-12-07 22:55:07+00:00,ohmzeus,"So here's the speculative attack:

1. Use current assets as collateral to offer bonds and raise capital
2. Use raised capital to purchase Bitcoin
3. By purchasing Bitcoin, price goes up and the value of your holdings increases by a greater factor than interest liabilities"
1796,2020-12-07 22:52:31+00:00,ohmzeus,"There's a multiplier effect on dollars entering Bitcoin. A $1B inflow of real dollars into the market does not increase the market cap by $1B, it increases it by more like $5-10B.

1797,2020-12-07 22:50:18+00:00,ohmzeus,"Now, as @michael_saylor is well aware, real inflation is far higher than 2.5%, so in real terms this is a free loan. However, $MSTR has disclosed that the proceeds from this bond sale will be used to add more Bitcoin to their balance sheet.

Here's where it gets interesting"
1798,2020-12-07 22:48:51+00:00,ohmzeus,"Although the yield on $MSTR's bonds are uncertain until they begin trading, its safe to assume they'll be below 4%, and more likely 2-2.5%, based on corporate bond yield data from Moody's https://t.co/rTKCyB1doR"
1799,2020-12-07 22:44:54+00:00,ohmzeus,"Now, although base interest rates are extremely low, not everyone has access to them. Chances are, if an individual looks for a loan today, you'll probably still end up paying 5-9% annually, depending on your credit risk and the type of loan

However, this is not true for corps"
1800,2020-12-07 22:42:58+00:00,ohmzeus,"As I‚Äôm sure most here are aware:

- Bitcoin is a supply-capped asset (21m will ever exist)
