33988,2021-01-03 19:49:49+00:00,BTC_Archive,@ZeitgeistFilm @noospheerdotorg Bitcoin doesn’t have that kind of daily volatility But I take your point. The 🔑 here is that anybody looking to store &amp; use their BTC for daily expenses would be facing even greater risks from holding fiat. So reverse the q - would you hold fiat if faced with 90% devaluation?
