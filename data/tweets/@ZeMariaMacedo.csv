667,2022-06-06 16:36:47+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"Ecosystem - There needs to be enough of an ecosystem to enable many integrations with different projects and primitives (both DeFi and otherwise)

Ideally, the ecosystem should also attract new assets to launch there such that there's a constant flow of interesting new assets"
668,2022-06-06 16:36:47+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"Speed - While it'll never be as fast as a CEX, it should be as close as possible. Block times must be fast enough to ensure high leverage is possible (i.e. efficient oracle updates + liquidations)

Ideally it'd be also fast enough to enable an orderbook but this isn't mandatory"
669,2022-06-06 16:36:46+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"As I see it the two most important characteristics in selecting the right place to launch are:

1) Speed 
2) Ecosystem"
670,2022-06-06 16:36:46+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"Assuming we agree with this vision, where should something like this be built? Should it be its own app-chain, an L2 or should it launch on a generalised SC chain like Ethereum?"
671,2022-06-06 16:36:46+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"For instance, sufficiently liquid NFTs could eventually be integrated into the superdApp. Users would be able to leverage trade their favourite NFTs or use them to cross-collateralise other positions"
672,2022-06-06 16:36:46+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"Any contract that can be integrated into this superDapp, provided it is whitelisted by governance 

It will therefore be able tap into all the innovation that happens across DeFi and Web 3 more broadly"
673,2022-06-06 16:36:45+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"The decentralised Binance will be able to integrate and add leverage on top of any primitive that exists in DeFi, including stuff like LP'ing, options vaults, yield farms, etc"
674,2022-06-06 16:36:45+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"In addition to the obvious benefits such as being non-custodial and censorship-resistant, the primary advantage is interoperability"
675,2022-06-06 16:36:45+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"But what's the advantage of this vs just using a CEX? 

No matter how fast the chain, it will never be as fast as a CEX. As such, it will never be able to have a risk/liquidation engine that's as efficient, or offer as much leverage 

So why would users choose this over a CEX?"
676,2022-06-06 16:36:45+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"It's difficult (though not impossible) to achieve this by combining separate protocols because each of them have their own isolated risk parameters and liquidation logic 

The ideal is to design it this way intentionally from the beginning as one product"
677,2022-06-06 16:36:45+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"Rather than separate protocols, these should work as one experience, with users being able to combine different positions (spot, margin, perps, options, etc) into one ""account"" with a single liquidation threshold. 

Users could then have multiple sub-accounts, similar to CEXes"
678,2022-06-06 16:36:44+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"In my view this decentralised Binance 'superDapp' must include a few key elements: 

- Launchpad: Fair access to new projects via auction mechanisms
- Spot trading
- Lending &amp; Borrowing
- Margin Trading 
- Derivs (mainly perps but eventually also options)
- Yield opportunities"
679,2022-06-06 16:36:44+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"I believe the future of DeFi is fully integrated experiences 

Users don't want to go one place to lend/borrow, another to trade spot, and yet another to trade perps

They want the Binance experience: one venue for all their DeFi needs"
680,2022-06-06 16:36:44+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"At Labs, we've been thinking a lot about the future of DeFi

While our thoughts on this are constantly evolving, wanted to share some of my current views on this to get some feedback from the community

682,2022-06-06 16:19:14+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"@jay_ftx @astroport_fi Hey sir, this isn't being voted on by governance rn because an emergency situation (i.e. the collapse of Terra classic) means ASTRO governance isn't live yet

813,2022-04-13 15:28:38+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"I feel like we’ve mostly seen this play out as large CVX holders have been pretty value-add / long-term oriented participants in Curve governance

In general, I think synergistic protocols / DAOs are the best stakeholders for a project"
814,2022-04-13 15:28:38+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"However, Convex itself now has the locked price exposure and vlCVX holders should be incentivised to make good long-term decisions for Curve

Not just because it affects the value of their CVX but also the sustainability of the cvxCRV / CRV peg"
815,2022-04-13 15:28:37+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"The user of the liquid staking derivative still has price exposure since the price of the derivative will track underlying

What he has gained is liquidity on his previously locked position + yield, giving up his voting power in exchange"
816,2022-04-13 15:28:37+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"(4) A separate but related argument is that the Convex style liquid staking derivative ($cvxCRV) breaks the veToken incentive design by separating “voting power from price exposure” 

This isn’t the case"
817,2022-04-13 15:28:37+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"In the real world, bribing is simply called “lobbying” and it’s a multi-billion dollar industry

As I see it, bribing is simply creating a market for governance power, which should tend to make things more efficient"
818,2022-04-13 15:28:36+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"veToken holders can choose to be short-term oriented, but the locked capital forces them to bear the long-term drawbacks of bad governance

At a higher level, it seems to me people have a knee-jerk negative reaction to bribing which I’m not sure is warranted"
819,2022-04-13 15:28:36+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"Non-veTokens also make it much easier for style governance attacks such as the Justin Sun style borrowing tokens to sway a vote 

Governance takeovers also become harder as attacker by definition has the most long term skin in the game

https://t.co/vfwQXyLTgC"
820,2022-04-13 15:28:35+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,The 1st thing to point out is that bribing exists in any persmissionless system. Bribes are also possible with non-veTokens and it’s much easier to be short-term oriented here since you don’t have to live with the long-term consequences of your decisions
821,2022-04-13 15:28:35+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"Since benefits of bribes are captured by the seller but the costs are socialised, this leads to sub-optimal outcomes where individuals are encouraged to maximise short-term profit at the expense of good, long-term governance decisions"
822,2022-04-13 15:28:35+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"(3) Bribes and short term thinking 

The argument is that veTokens don’t actually lead to long-term thinking due to the existence of bribes"
823,2022-04-13 15:28:34+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"Finally, even in the case of Convex, it’s a misnomer to call Curve ownership “centralised” just because Convex owns 50% of governance power 

After all, this is distributed amongst CVX holders. This is even more so the case with the introduction of fractional governance"
824,2022-04-13 15:28:34+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"My base case is that there will be multiple Convex-style protocols built on Astroport, each w/ their own liquid staking derivative, creating a healthy competitive market

We're already seeing this with @retrogrademoney,@reactor_money,@ApolloDAO, all entering the $ASTRO wars"
825,2022-04-13 15:28:33+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"Instead of a whitelist, Astroport allows all pools to have a gauge (i.e. to be be eligible to be voted on to receive emissions), with only the top 10 (parameter set by governance) receiving issuance pro rata to their share of votes"
826,2022-04-13 15:28:32+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"We don’t believe this centralisation would’ve happened if Curve were more open with its whitelisting process from the beginning 

Alternatively, it’s also possible to remove the whitelist altogether which is what @astroport_fi has chosen to do"
827,2022-04-13 15:28:31+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"While this did happen with Convex, we don’t believe this is due to any inherent network effects but rather because of the Curve whitelist which allowed Convex to gain a massive head start competitive advantage

https://t.co/48k40bEDpJ"
828,2022-04-13 15:28:30+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"(2) The argument here is that vetokens naturally lead to centralisation of governance power due to higher barriers to participation + network effects of liquid staking derivs 

The example cited is @ConvexFinance which now controls 50% of Curve governance power"
829,2022-04-13 15:28:30+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"The “governance takeover” framing is also strange since those conducting the “takeover” would have the most skin in the game and incentive to ensure the changes made are positive

Once again, seems like a feature to me rather than a bug"
830,2022-04-13 15:28:29+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,The argument that “governance security will fall for multi year periods during ownership transitions (when large holders stop relocking tokens in preparation for sale” also makes little sense to me since it assumes there will be no other governance participants coming in
831,2022-04-13 15:28:29+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"There’s nothing inherent in the veModel that makes it more appealing to whales. In fact it’s the only token model where a smaller, more long-term oriented holder can magnify their governance power vs a less committed whale"
832,2022-04-13 15:28:28+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"In my view, it’s better for a community to have a smaller number of highly motivated, long-term oriented governors than a large number of passive, disinterested ones"
833,2022-04-13 15:28:28+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"The whole point of the veToken is to dilute governance power away from short-term motivated participants and towards long-term oriented participants. There are naturally less of the latter than the former

This is a feature, not a bug."
834,2022-04-13 15:28:28+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"In a similar vein, it is argued that this makes governance attacks easier by “raising cost to defend against takeovers”

This argument makes very little sense to me"
835,2022-04-13 15:28:27+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"(2) Reduces investor base / makes governance attacks easier 

The argument here is that not many people are willing to lock for multiple years and that veTokens thus reduce potential investor/governor base"
836,2022-04-13 15:28:27+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"I believe their arguments can be grouped into 4 main reasons why veTokens are bad:



(1) Reduce investor base  
(2) Centralise governance power 
(3) Lead to bribes and short term thinking
(4) Liquid staking deriv breaks token incentive design

1022,2022-03-17 17:24:22+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"15/ UST's dependence on @anchor_protocol, regulatory pressure, or even a global recession, can all lead to contractions in UST supply

A sufficiently violent contraction could eat through BTC reserves and leave LUNA vulnerable to a death spiral"
1023,2022-03-17 17:24:21+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"14/ While exogenous collateral puts $LUNA in a much better place, with $15b in UST supply and growing, it’s reasonable to ask whether $3b in BTC is enough to backstop the peg

The answer is no one knows. This is uncharted territory and we’re definitely not out of the woods"
1024,2022-03-17 17:24:21+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"13/ The @LFG_org raise shows that once demand/market share is there, it’s not hard to bootstrap collateral

This utility acts as a demand floor for $UST and negates some of the reflexivity of the death spiral

1026,2022-03-17 17:24:19+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"10/ $UST already defied the odds by not just surviving but thriving as a pure algo stable: growing supply, keeping a tight peg and withstanding shocks such as May ‘21

What Terra achieved is truly unprecedented and #few understand it. How did it happen?"
1027,2022-03-17 17:24:19+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"9/ $UST's design allows it to grow far faster than its debt-based counterparts

It’s already the #1 decentralised stablecoin by market cap and growing at about 2-3x the rate of #2 ($DAI is actually declining)

But everyone knows $UST grows fast so let's talk about resilience https://t.co/HwFujTtNpP"
1028,2022-03-17 17:24:17+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"8/ Decentralised stablecoins are a multi-trillion dollar opportunity. They’re also the ultimate network effect product (liquidity, integrations, 'lindy', etc), meaning they'll likely concentrate around a few huge winners

In a network effects biz, he who grows fastest wins"
1029,2022-03-17 17:24:17+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"7/ It's easy to focus on this, extrapolate from the past, and assume that LUNA is doomed to the same fate as its predecessors. But as with all venture investing, the right question to ask is ""What if it works?""

In other words, what's the bull case for $UST ?"
1030,2022-03-17 17:24:17+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"6/ It's important to recognise that, other than $UST which hasn't just survived but thrived, all other algorithmic stablecoin systems have fallen victim to the death spiral 

As someone who still holds a decent amount of $ESD, I can tell you a death spiral is no fun at all"
1031,2022-03-17 17:24:17+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"5/ The risk is the so-called death spiral, depicted below

Endogenous collateral creates reflexivity which just means a self-reinforcing positive loop; $UST contraction leads to $LUNA being minted and declining in price, which leads to fear and more $UST redemptions https://t.co/vrWcV7VnKJ"
1032,2022-03-17 17:24:15+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"4/ Algo stables don't require debt or external collateral. As a result, they're more capital efficient and can grow far quicker than their debt-based counterparts

However, this also means they have higher tail risk and are less resilient to black swan type events"
1033,2022-03-17 17:24:13+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"1/ Until the recent @LFG_org reserve $BTC raise, $UST was an “algorithmic stablecoin” meaning it was backed only by endogenous collateral (i.e. $LUNA itself)

This is in contrast to debt-based stablecoins such as @MakerDAO which are overcollateralised by external assets"

Read the litepaper for more info: https://t.co/Yfi6LbRRor"
1680,2021-10-27 14:34:25+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"24/ In the spirit of community participation, Astroport will be launching with an innovative lockdrop + liquidity bootstrap auction architecture, distributing 7.5% of its supply to committed LPs 

Read more about this here: https://t.co/lHiBW3i3vh"
1681,2021-10-27 14:34:25+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"23/ Our hope is that this token economic design encourages a diverse community of users, projects, and other ecosystem participants to stake and contribute to the DAO

We believe this level of community involvement will ultimately result in a better protocol"
1682,2021-10-27 14:34:24+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"22/ Crucially Astroport has no VCs or passive investors 

Instead, it has been bootstrapped by the contributors who built it, including Terraform Labs, @Delphi_Digital, @IDEOVC , @atticlab_it, @stablekwon, @Lomashuk from @LidoFinance, @madcapslaugh, and many others"
1683,2021-10-27 14:34:24+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"21/ Perhaps most importantly, @astroport_fi will be community-owned, with 70% of supply accruing to the community

1684,2021-10-27 14:34:23+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"20/ Share of protocol fees

Stakers will receive a share of protocol fees

Half of these fees are used to buy back $ASTRO and stake it into $xASTRO, accruing to all assemblers. The other half is distributed to vxAstro stakers to reward those with more skin in the game https://t.co/Qrp8qnDWMB"
1685,2021-10-27 14:34:20+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"19/ Preferential yield 

LPs who are also stakers will receive a boost to their share of ASTRO emissions. This creates a virtuous circle in which LPs are encouraged to become assemblers and vice versa"
1686,2021-10-27 14:34:20+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"18/ This mechanism means all stakeholders (LPs, community members and even projects themselves) are incentivised to participate in governance in order to maximise the governance power they earn from their preferred pools https://t.co/VPQjzpEkvY"
1687,2021-10-27 14:34:17+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,17/ This will take the form of a bi-weekly governance game where assemblers vote for their favourite pools with the top 8 receiving incentives proportional to the votes they received https://t.co/GCNMQkbei0

Assemblers get to decide which pools receive $ASTRO incentives and how much each pool receives"
1689,2021-10-27 14:34:15+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"15/ In exchange for governing the protocol, Assemblers will receive a set of key benefits: 

 ✦ Direct the flow of $ASTRO via voting
 ✦ Preferential yield (boosties)
 ✦ A share of protocol fees https://t.co/r2hBs8JGpZ"
1690,2021-10-27 14:34:13+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"14/ Assemblers will be able to multiply their influence by demonstrating skin in the game, locking their $xASTRO for up to 2 years and receiving additional vxASTRO points 

This provides a mechanism for high-conviction smaller holders to magnify their influence and rewards"
1691,2021-10-27 14:34:13+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"13/ Astroport will be fully governed by the Astral Assembly: Astroport’s DAO which will is responsible for all protocol decisions

Any $ASTRO holder can participate in the assembly by staking $ASTRO, receiving back $xASTRO"
1692,2021-10-27 14:34:12+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"12/ Token Econ &amp; Governance 

Astroport is a public good for the Terra ecosystem. To fulfil its role, it must be owned and governed by its users 

Astroport’s $ASTRO token acts as a key coordination mechanism, combining best practices learned from other protocols https://t.co/8dXQCKopJ6"
1693,2021-10-27 14:34:11+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"11/ LBPs, pioneered by @BalancerLabs, are a token launch mechanism that enables price discovery while preventing the bot frontrunning that affects other launch mechanisms 

They’ve become extremely popular on Ethereum and I expect the same to happen on Terra"
1694,2021-10-27 14:34:10+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"10/ Astroport’s invariant pools will allow Orion to do the swapping on the Terra side instead, saving on fees (see diagram below)

Another example of where invariant pools can be useful is the $bLUNA - $LUNA pool, leading to far more efficient liquidity around the $LUNA price https://t.co/JuNfpRvcNz"
1695,2021-10-27 14:34:09+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"9/ As a practical example, consider the following: 

@Orion_money lets users swap from any stablecoin on Ethereum to $UST, bridging it to Terra and depositing into Anchor. It currently uses @CurveFinance for swaps and its users must therefore pay high Ethereum gas fees"
1696,2021-10-27 14:34:09+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"8/ Stableswap invariant pools allow for efficient trading between stable assets such as stablecoins or different wrapped versions of the same assets (e.g. $bLUNA / $LUNA)

These will become increasingly important as the Terra ecosystem grows and connects to other chains"
1697,2021-10-27 14:34:08+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"7/ @terraswap_io currently only supports xy=k pools 

In addition to these, Astroport will also initially support Stableswap Invariant pools as well as Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools (LBPs) https://t.co/vxMVJMVyak"
1698,2021-10-27 14:34:07+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"6/ It then routes among these different pools to ensure optimal execution for traders, basically functioning as its own aggregator"
1699,2021-10-27 14:34:07+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"5/ Astroport takes a different approach 

Instead of specialising in a particular algorithm, it uses a flexible architecture that allows builders to create new pool types that fit seamlessly within Astroport with minimal changes to core protocol code"
1700,2021-10-27 14:34:06+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"4/ It also means traders must use ""aggregators"" such as @1inch which route across these AMMs to ensure optimal execution, introducing a secondary layer of fees"
1701,2021-10-27 14:34:06+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"3/ On Ethereum, most AMMs have elected to specialise in a particular pool type 

This means LPs must understand and select between a variety of AMMs to find the optimal one for their assets and preferences"
1702,2021-10-27 14:34:05+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"2/ Flexible pool model 

Different AMMs use different algorithms (also referred to as ""pool types"") to price assets, with each one being appropriate for certain kinds of assets

For instance, Uniswap's xyk pool is appropriate for volatile assets but inefficient for stable assets"
1703,2021-10-27 14:34:05+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"1/ As I see it, @astroport_fi provides two fundamental improvements to existing AMMs: 

 ✦ Flexible pool model
 ✦ Token econ &amp; governance

1843,2021-09-08 17:23:29+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"11/ Built w/ input from @Jump_Labs, Terra’s index protocol @nebula_protocol has imo the most interesting mechanism design out there, with rebalancing via taxes/incentives on trading which punish/reward traders for moving the baskets away/towards their target weights"
1844,2021-09-08 17:23:27+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"9/ Once Columbus 5 goes live, the real fun begins, with @astroport_fi, @mars_protocol and @nebula_protocol all hitting the scene

Terra’s state of the art AMM @astroport_fi will kickstart #TerraAutumn in earnest with double incentives on mAsset farming ( $ASTRO + $MIR) https://t.co/Fd7vMdeU0J"
1845,2021-09-08 17:23:20+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"8/ $aUST growth will reduce borrowing costs as Anchor continues to cement itself as the go-to credit protocol for staked assets, initially via $bLUNA and $bETH but soon through $bSOL, $bDOT, and $bATOM too"
1846,2021-09-08 17:23:19+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"7/ Just as Orion sucks cryptodollars ($USDT/$USDC) into $UST, @anchor_protocol's 20% savings rate will continue to absorb real world dollars into $UST through integrations with wallets and fintech apps 

All this $UST will get re-circulated into TeFi via leverage on PoS assets"
1847,2021-09-08 17:23:18+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"6/ The first piece of the puzzle is @orion_money's launch. Orion is Terra’s $UST blackhole, exporting Anchor’s 20% savings rate to other chains (starting with Ethereum)

It has already attracted &gt;$70M TVL and will continue to grow significantly as it adds more chains towards EOY"
1848,2021-09-08 17:23:16+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"5/ The ultimate goal is “closing the loop” such that a user never has to leave $UST. This requires highly developed investment and spending ecosystems

The next few months leading up to and following Columbus 5 will unleash massive progress in both of these areas"
1849,2021-09-08 17:23:15+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"4/ 

Investment - TeFi gives users access to a full decentralised financial system (yield, lending, synthetics, asset mgmt, exchange) + wide range of assets to invest in

Spending - Initially Chai and increasingly others are helping to make $UST spendable worldwide"
1850,2021-09-08 17:23:14+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"3/ The decentralisation mechanisms are well-covered, so I’ll focus mostly on utility. What makes money useful? 

Money can either be spent or held/invested (deferred spending) 

Terra aims to make $UST useful for both"
1851,2021-09-08 17:23:13+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"1/ Before we begin, it’s important to realise what Terra is

Terra’s product is often misunderstood as an L1 

In reality, Terra’s only product is $UST. Everything else, including the L1, simply exists to help make $UST the most useful and decentralised form of money there is"
1852,2021-09-08 17:23:11+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"Few realise it, but #TerraAutumn is coming 🌖🍂

1963,2021-07-13 12:49:19+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,@kermankohli @_allenjl @AlphaFinanceLab @beta_finance This should allow for more capital efficient short-selling as well as stuff like higher leverage since protocol can custody your USDC from the short (similar to lev yield farming)
1964,2021-07-13 12:47:05+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,@kermankohli @_allenjl @AlphaFinanceLab @beta_finance I don't think it's that different - it's just more optimised for short-selling by not allowing borrowing of collateral assets or use of borrow assets as collateral
1965,2021-07-13 12:03:34+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"19/ These issues are solvable and we're confident that @_allenjl and the galaxy 🧠's at @AlphaFinanceLab can do so

The market for shorting LTAs is large and @beta_finance's design is uniquely positioned to facilitate this

Let the shitcoin shorting wars begin! https://t.co/8MbGYQnh9s"
1966,2021-07-13 12:03:31+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"18/ Another challenge will be building sufficient liquidity in the LTAs

After all, lenders know they are lending to short-sellers which may make this an unattractive proposition for them, especially since LTAs often have high yields available for staking/LPing anyway"
1967,2021-07-13 12:03:31+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"17/ With LTA loans the protocol's losses are potentially unlimited 

Once outstanding loan &gt; collateral + liquidation fee, there is no incentive for liquidators to liquidate but the LTA may continue to pump 

Bad loans --&gt; shortfall events --&gt; potential protocol insolvency"
1968,2021-07-13 12:03:31+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"16/ To be clear, there are still risks to this model 

Even as pure borrow assets, LTA's high volatility and low liquidity means that loans may be difficult to liquidate during extreme market moves"
1969,2021-07-13 12:03:30+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"15/ The advantage of this architecture is that it preserves the advantages of a single pool model wrt not fragmenting liquidity

At the same time, it minimizes the risks of LTAs by making them unusable as collateral"
1970,2021-07-13 12:03:30+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"14/ Traders deposit collateral assets and borrow LTAs against them to short, paying an interest rate to LTA lenders

Lenders deposit LTAs which are loaned to traders, collecting a yield in return"
1971,2021-07-13 12:03:29+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"13/ @beta_finance uses a single pool model but one specialised for short-selling LTAs

Basically, there are two types of assets:  

- collateral assets which can only be used as collateral
- borrow assets (LTAs) which can be loaned/borrowed but cannot be used as collateral"
1972,2021-07-13 12:03:29+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"12/ The data seems to bear this out as thus far isolated pool lending protocols have failed to achieve meaningful traction compared to single pool designs

So, how does @beta_finance's design allow for borrowing of LTAs?"
1973,2021-07-13 12:03:29+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"11/ Users must determine for each pool whether the yield adequately compensates them for the risks they're taking on

In my view, this defeats the main value of a money market for most users: earning interest on idle assets with minimal effort and risk"
1974,2021-07-13 12:03:28+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"10/ A user on @AaveAave can simply deposit USDC and earn interest on it, knowing they're protected by the Safety Module in case of a Shortfall Event

On Fuse / Kashi, there are multiple USDC pools, each offering different yields and posing different risks"
1975,2021-07-13 12:03:28+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,9/ One way to look at this is that the single pool design offloads risk decisions (and potential downside of these decisions) to a DAO whereas segregated pool relies on individual users making the decisions and taking the downside
1976,2021-07-13 12:03:27+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"8/ In both these architectures, shortfall events only affect lenders in the specific pool where they happen rather than the entire protocol 

The tradeoff is that liquidity is fragmented and risk decisions must be made by individual lenders rather than the protocol"
1977,2021-07-13 12:03:27+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"7/ In the case of Rari, the idea is that eventually anyone will be able to create their own money market pool of collateral and borrow assets, defining their risk parameters and oracles

In the case of Kashi, risks are isolated within each individual collateral/borrow pair"
1978,2021-07-13 12:03:27+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"6/ The common thread between all these issues is that cross-margin protocols are only as strong as their weakest collateral asset

Permissionless architectures like @RariCapital's fuse pools or @SushiSwap's Kashi address this by segregating assets and therefore risks"
1979,2021-07-13 12:03:26+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"5/ More straight forwardly, liquidity for an LTA may simply dry up during an extreme market move, meaning liquidators are not willing to take on the risk of selling the collateral

This leads to a shortfall event which can cause potential protocol insolvency"
1980,2021-07-13 12:03:26+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"4/ Alternatively, assuming an SC ""infinite mint"" exploit, an attacker can simply keep minting more tokens and depositing them as collateral on the lending protocol, borrowing external assets as the oracle fails to update"
1981,2021-07-13 12:03:25+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"3/ If they're accepted as collateral, LTAs (i.e. shitcoins) can be used to borrow quality assets. This is problematic

For example, if an LTA oracle is manipulated and the price is set to infinity, an attacker can potentially borrow all the other assets on the lending protocol"
1982,2021-07-13 12:03:25+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"2/ The reason LTAs aren't listed on protocols like @AaveAave / @compoundfinance is because, due to these protocol's cross-margin based architecture, every new asset introduces systemic risk

This is especially the case when they can be used as collateral"
1983,2021-07-13 12:03:25+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"1/ Long tail assets (LTAs) are characterized by relatively high volatility, low liquidity as well as potentially high smart contract and counterparty risks

The appeal of shorting LTAs is clear, so why isn't this possible at scale on existing lending protocols?"

All this gets put on steroids with the upcoming Alpha X: Alpha’s tokenised perps product 

Tokenised perps will eventually be usable as collateral for farming and allow users to create almost any exposure they want

2201,2021-04-28 16:25:56+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"15/ V2 also allows for more degen farming strats as users can get levered yield while being long their favourite coins vs USD rather than ETH. Think farming Pool 2s on 2x notional

Exposures also become easier to manage as farmers are no longer farming with two volatile assets"
2202,2021-04-28 16:25:55+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"14/ On Alpha V1, all strategies were short ETH

With Alpha V2 adding stablecoin pools, farmers will be able to borrow stables and get yield-bearing long exposure to their favourite assets

Instead of paying funding on perps, users will get paid to be long on Alpha V2"
2203,2021-04-28 16:25:55+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"13/ V2 advances Alpha towards becoming the go-to industrial yield farming platform 

While a lot of the features like new kinds of collateral and more pools on @CurveFinance are dope, the one I'm personally most excited about is stablecoin lending pools"
2204,2021-04-28 16:25:55+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"12/ It’s not just degen yield though, leverage also gives farmers greater flexibility 

You might want to farm the Pool 2 ETH pair on your favourite asset, but for some reason you’re bearish ETH and don’t want the exposure (ngmi)

On Alpha, you can borrow the $ETH and farm"
2205,2021-04-28 16:25:54+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"11/ On @AlphaFinanceLab, both your collateral and your debt are used to farm, with the combination making up your total collateral on the platform 

As a result, you can farm on up to 2x notional (or more in Alpha V2), leveraging yields by 2x or more https://t.co/y5cg9QRuJ5"
2206,2021-04-28 16:25:53+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"10/ On Compound, you deposit collateral and then borrow some asset which you custody and farm with 

As a result, you farm on only a fraction of your collateral value, reducing yields by 25-60% depending on LTV and how high a debt ratio you're comfortable with https://t.co/OhThBPzUeM"
2207,2021-04-28 16:25:52+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"9/ As yield farming becomes an industry, leverage will become as important for farmers as it is for traders

If you’re borrowing to farm, using a platform like Alpha is far more efficient than a traditional money market like @compoundfinance. Why?"
2208,2021-04-28 16:25:52+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"8/ While yields will come down over time, astute farmers will multiply them by choosing the right projects. The most ambitious farmers will look to get ahead by using leverage

2211,2021-04-28 16:25:48+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"5/ A question everyone asks is: where does the yield come from? 

The simple answer is speculation, as yields are sustained by those buying crop-coins 

The better answer is that yields come from the opportunity to own the futur of france"
2212,2021-04-28 16:25:48+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"4/ Curve is a good example of a well-designed YF campaign which has resulted in the token being owned by its largest LPs, creating an in-built moat 

As our understanding evolves, more projects will opt for perpetual issuance, taxing passive holders in favour of active ones"
2213,2021-04-28 16:25:48+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"3/ As explained below, a well-designed YF campaign creates a positive reflexive loop, transforming speculation into fundamentals, bootstrapping supply-sides and communities

2214,2021-04-28 16:25:47+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"2/ Seen another way, YF dilutes passive tokenholders in favour of active holders that contribute to the project in some way

Over time, it results in user-owned projects, concentrating token ownership in the hands of MVP community members"
2215,2021-04-28 16:25:47+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"1/ But first of all, what even is Yield Farming? 

At its simplest, YF involves a project distributing tokens directly to users for taking some on-chain action 

It makes sense because it allows projects to reward users for taking actions that benefit the protocol"
2216,2021-04-28 16:25:46+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"Yield Farming is underestimated

I believe it represents the birth of a new industry, with farmers becoming a new kind of market participant

In addition to standard pool 2 incentives, we also designed two separate incentive campaigns aimed at building up targeted liquidity for perps and options while avoiding wash trading https://t.co/8YRClakvOh"
2282,2021-04-08 15:25:01+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"11/12 This means xPTF holders are incentivized to use the exchange to receive fee rebates and maximize utility of their token holdings 

OTOH, large exchange users are incentivized to become xPTF holders in order to reduce fee cost and maximize trading profits"
2283,2021-04-08 15:25:00+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"10/12 Nevertheless, to further align incentives between DAO stakers and exchange users, we propose a tiered benefits system for stakers, pictured below https://t.co/fz9yItcK4F"
2284,2021-04-08 15:24:59+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"9/12 The DAO could be incentivized to approve an overly optimistic risk framework in order to generate more profits for stakers. However, this would be as shortsighted as $NXM holders refusing to pay out claims

In the long-run, it will cause lack of trust in the exchange"
2285,2021-04-08 15:24:59+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"8/12 The risk framework is a key piece of the system and should be considered carefully and monitored/updated regularly by governance

@Delphi_Digital has proposed an initial risk assessment methodology, but exploring it is outside the scope of this piece"
2286,2021-04-08 15:24:58+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"7/12 25% of fees will flow to the DAO, split as follows: 

Before IF is sufficiently capitalized: 80% IF, 20% xPTF
After IF is sufficiently capitalized: 100% xPTF

2287,2021-04-08 15:24:57+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"6/12 If a shortfall event occurs, the 3-tranche architecture kicks in:

1st  tranche: IF Fees Pool
2nd tranche: IF Staking Pool 
3rd tranche: xPTF staking pool (up to 30% auctioned off to cover deficit) 

If this isn't enough, the DAO can choose to mint PTF or issue debt tokens https://t.co/5Q03JCN9wB"
2288,2021-04-08 15:24:56+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"5/12 The IF is the junior tranche, which will be built up over time via fee revenue from the exchange 

In the meanwhile, we will run an ""insurance mining campaign"", incentivizing USDC holders to stake into the IF in exchange for PTF rewards (h/t @DDX_Official for the idea) https://t.co/2848sh5A2v"
2289,2021-04-08 15:24:55+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"4/12 We've taken this skin-in-the-game approach for $PTF

The DAO will be governed by PTF holders who stake into it, receiving xPTF which grants them governance and cashflow rights

xPTF also acts as the senior tranche,  backstopping claims which cannot be fully covered by the IF https://t.co/Mno8npCfHA"
2290,2021-04-08 15:24:54+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"3/12 We believe protocols in which governors make risk decisions that affect 3rd parties (i.e. users) should ensure governors bear the consequences of their decisions, both positive and negative

@AaveAave's safety module is a great example of this principle in action"

🔹DAO
🔹Insurance Fund
🔹Exchange 

The DAO governs the insurance fund which underwrites the exchange, deciding on capital allocation, risk framework and assessing incoming claims https://t.co/XDSUS1Ryes"
2292,2021-04-08 15:24:52+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"1/12 @PowerTradeHQ will initially operate as a CEX focusing on leveraged products including options and perps

Rather than do a burn/discount token a la $BNB / $FTT, Powertrade takes this a step further by tokenizing its insurance fund and putting it in the hands of $PTF holders"

2487,2020-12-30 18:03:44+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"11/ In the simpler model, users can only stake to the SM, underwriting all risks and receiving a blended return 

In the second case, users can boost SM returns by staking to specific contracts using leverage, taking on varying amounts of risk and being rewarded accordingly https://t.co/38RM855Zvo"
2488,2020-12-30 18:03:42+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"10/ This is achieved by using a money market style architecture leveraging Aave’s current interest rate model to calculate cover pricing based on utilisation rate

Where the the designs differ is in terms of their supply-side experience. https://t.co/am0cbNdboI"
2489,2020-12-30 18:03:41+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"9/ In both cases, users get access to one-click insurance with payment being streamed over time and netted out of deposit APYs rather than purchased upfront a la @NexusMutual and @CoverProtocol https://t.co/QWPyOCegxn"
2490,2020-12-30 18:03:40+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"8/ Based on this insight, we propose two models: 

The first is a simplified, unlevered version which could act as an evolutionary step towards the second model which we see as the more efficient, final form design"
2491,2020-12-30 18:03:40+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"7/ In our new design, insurance is instead offered as a separate product on the demand side 

This makes it possible to compute cover demand and capacity precisely and thus price risk using market mechanisms, scaling back some of the independence granted to aDAOs"
2492,2020-12-30 18:03:39+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"6/ This, we hoped, would allow Aave to innovate quicker by segregating risk while incentivizing good decisions by the principle of skin in the game; ensuring those making decisions are forced to bear the potential downside if they are wrong"
2493,2020-12-30 18:03:39+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"5/ Without a market based mechanism to price cover and therefore risk, our design instead offloaded these decisions to independent aDAOs who bore both the risk and reward of the money markets they managed 

They provided risk capital and earned fees in exchange for not blowing up"
2494,2020-12-30 18:03:39+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"4/ Our initial proposal sought to improve on this current model while keeping the bundled insurance + money-market design 

This meant that demand for insurance was impossible to compute separately from money market demand https://t.co/cVhWTRSILJ"
2495,2020-12-30 18:03:38+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"3/ This hampers the speed at which Aave can innovate by increasing the costs of failed experiments 

Finally, the current SM is capital inefficient since it is unlevered and bundles different risks to offer a blended return, appealing to a narrower capital base"
2496,2020-12-30 18:03:37+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"2/ Because insurance is bundled in with Aave's money markets, it's impossible to compute cover demand, pricing, capacity or how much to pay underwriters

Any new money market added is also automatically insured by the SM, introducing unlimited contagion and systemic risk"
2497,2020-12-30 18:03:37+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"1/ Before diving into our proposal it's important to understand how the current Aave Safety Module (SM) works

The SM is an insurance product which underwrites all risks (SC, oracle and liquidation) for all users of Aave protocol

2537,2020-12-16 12:39:34+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"25/ It goes without saying that both DEXes and insurance have massive upside from here given the growth we expect in DeFi as a whole - we are interested in speaking with and investing in teams in both sectors

Disclaimer: Delphi Ventures is an investor in $RUNE, $NXM and Debank"
2538,2020-12-16 12:36:48+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"24/ While an imperfect comparison, it's worth remembering that in the real world insurance is  a $6.3T industry and the largest segment within financial services alongside banking. Exchanges are far smaller by any measure"
2539,2020-12-16 12:36:48+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"23/ While both insurance and exchange will be massive sectors, we see insurance as being better positioned to capture value long-term 

This is not reflected in prices right now as the cumulative market cap of DEXes is $2.7B compared to only ~$230M for insurance"
2540,2020-12-16 12:36:48+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"22/ ...e.g. protocol insurance for treasuries 

Large capital pools can underwrite proprietary cover, diversifying their liabilities and enabling greater diversification. This in turn provides greater efficiency, generating the familiar network effect flywheel"
2541,2020-12-16 12:36:47+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"21/ Non-linear liquidity network effect 

Unlike exchanges, the liquidity network effect for an insurance product scales non-linearly in that a platform with more liquidity does not just offer better pricing but is also capable of underwriting entirely new types of risks..."
2542,2020-12-16 12:36:47+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"20/ This is also why we remain bearish on prediction market based insurance models which are capitalized 1:1

As we see it, these models will always remain either expensive for cover buyers or provide low yields to LPs"
2543,2020-12-16 12:36:47+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"19/ Leverage can only be achieved by underwriting diversified risks 

As such, not only is stealing liquidity difficult, new entrants will struggle to compete on price even if they attract liquidity as they will not have the diversification necessary to enable leverage"
2544,2020-12-16 12:36:46+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"18/ Diversification &amp; Efficiency  

Unlike exchanges in which efficiency depends almost solely on liquidity, for insurance protocols efficiency relies on leverage: using $1 of capital to underwrite &gt;$1 worth of risk"
2545,2020-12-16 12:36:46+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,17/ This brand moat can only be developed over years of paying out claims and cannot be forked or vampire attacked away
2546,2020-12-16 12:36:46+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"16/ Differentiated Demand  

Unlike exchanges in which traders care primarily about best execution and have little to no brand loyalty, insurance platforms are chosen based not just on pricing but also on a user’s confidence in the platform's ability to pay out"
2547,2020-12-16 12:36:45+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"15/ In addition, supply-siders have skin in the game and must accurately assess claims to ensure the long-term growth of the platform 

This is very different from an LP passively providing liquidity in an AMM"
2548,2020-12-16 12:36:45+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"14/ Differentiated supply

Since insurance cover is underwritten for a given period of time, supply-side liquidity is less fluid as there must always be enough capacity to pay out existing claims (i.e. @NexusMutual's MCR)"
2549,2020-12-16 12:36:45+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"13/ Now let’s compare this with insurance. Liquidity is also a moat for insurance in that more liquidity means greater capacity. 

However, insurance has several additional moats"
2550,2020-12-16 12:36:44+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"12/ As such, an exchange’s moat is liquidity since this means better execution, higher trading fees and better yield for LPs 

However, liquidity is fluid and will flow towards the highest yield. Rent extraction to tokenholders hampers execution/yield and thus the exchange's moat"
2551,2020-12-16 12:36:44+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"11/ While the supply side provides greater opportunity for differentiation on things like algorithm optimisations (@BreederDodo ), flexibility (@BalancerLabs ), types of assets (@thorchain_org ), LPs are still primarily interested in optimising yield"
2552,2020-12-16 12:36:44+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"10/ While some users may interact with their favourite DEXes directly, we feel aggregators such as @1inchExchange , @DeBankDeFi will increasingly dominate since they allow users to get best execution on trades across all active DEXes"
2553,2020-12-16 12:36:43+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"9/ As I argued in my piece on DEX Wars and Aggregation Theory, DEX liquidity is “undifferentiated supply”, meaning it is highly price elastic as most traders care only about best execution 

https://t.co/53isZzDfGY"
2554,2020-12-16 12:36:43+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"8/ We will now apply our framework to two different sectors: decentralised exchanges and insurance, focusing primarily on the second and third tests"
2555,2020-12-16 12:36:42+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"7/ Good investments must pass all three tests, a daunting task made more difficult by the open, forkable nature of projects in the space 

I believe #few in the space currently think about investments in these terms, leading to significant mispricings"
2556,2020-12-16 12:36:42+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"6/ The third test is the one traditional investors have least experience with 

Unlike equity which is likely to be valuable if the project passes the first 2 tests, the value of a token depends entirely on its design. Each token is different and must be analysed independently"
2557,2020-12-16 12:36:41+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"5/ Ideally, as investors we want projects with multiple, compounding, unforkable moats that cumulatively mean the project has some form of increasing returns to scale, meaning it gets more difficult to unseat the bigger it is

https://t.co/bctycuSaBb"
2558,2020-12-16 12:36:41+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"4/ The second test is tougher. In traditional markets, investors can get away with being less rigorous about this as proprietary technology and strong teams can pose moats 

Crypto's open nature means only network effects provide reliable long-term defensibility"
2559,2020-12-16 12:36:41+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"3/ The first test is the easiest in the sense that it’s one investors in traditional markets are already used to making

Is the product useful and does it have product-market fit? Is the team experienced and capable?"
2560,2020-12-16 12:36:40+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"2/

👉 Will the project create value and attract users?

👉 Will the project be able to capture value from those users and establish a long-term, defensible moat?

👉 Will the value captured accrue to the token? https://t.co/jB9NnXOUOh"

We're putting together some research on the governance space and would love to speak about you and find out more about what you're building

What's the best way to get in touch?"
2610,2020-11-28 12:04:52+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,@DegenSpartan Have you looked at the COVER design?
2611,2020-11-27 18:38:23+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"9/9 It's worth remembering that unlike with other DeFi protocols, liquidity provides an actual moat for Nexus since MCR is locked at 100%

This gives Nexus a headstart in the form of a large supply of capital to focus on what matters: generating cover demand"
2612,2020-11-27 18:38:23+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"8/9 Despite the MCR cucking as @DegenSpartan so aptly puts it, we still see @NexusMutual as the most efficient insurance model in DeFi right now

Its strong brand, $85M capital pool and diversified cover exposure represent real moats that upstarts will have to overcome"
2613,2020-11-27 18:38:22+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"6/9 As such, a dedicated insurance protocol like @NexusMutual that underwrites risk across the space (and eventually outside of it) must always exist and will likely always be more efficient than specialised insurance pools"
2614,2020-11-27 18:38:22+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"5/9 The only way for projects to avoid this is to diversify, offering cover to other projects

Not only is this not their core competency, they are also competing with Nexus's existing diversified capital pool which enables more leverage and better rates"
2615,2020-11-27 18:38:22+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"4/9 Risks across the crypto space are already highly correlated, but this is even more pronounced within a particular credit protocol since: 

🔸smart contracts are all built by the same people 
🔸the same oracles used in the same way across protocol
🔸risk framework is uniform"
2616,2020-11-27 18:38:21+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"3/9 While we believe this makes a lot of sense as a token model, we don't think it is competitive but rather complementary to @NexusMutual 

This is because insurance relies on leverage to be efficient and leverage requires diversified, uncorrelated risk exposures"

Could they really do this now?"
2717,2020-10-25 20:00:56+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,@tbr90 *Digital* sound money is the game changer imo. Combine this with a world in which value is increasingly created digitally and this vastly reduces the leverage governments have over their citizens citizens/capital base.
2718,2020-10-24 12:12:33+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"@ChrisBlec Imo, you can't compare the two like that because DeFi isn't trying to be a SoV. It's trying to be the financial infrastructure that gives that SoV its utility 

Bitcoin has the right values to build money, but not to build early stage fintech"

2) A response to constraints in L1 scalability which make on-chain orderbook architectures unfeasible

Will AMMs still be a thing once we have L1 scalability? Feel free to add colour"
2743,2020-10-11 18:58:00+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"P.S. This isn't investment or life advice as I'm in no position to give out either. Just some thoughts that have helped me personally deal with swings over the years

Hopefully they can help someone else and get me some followers in the process"
2744,2020-10-11 18:58:00+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"10/10 Being an absolute Chad and having 95% of your net worth in crypto is cool if you're ok with the risks 

That said, some rebalancing makes sense and can also lead to better investment and life outcomes if it means you're less stressed and able sleep better at night"
2745,2020-10-11 18:58:00+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"9/10 Finally, crypto is a highly +EV bet but if you don't think theres a significant chance of failure, you're kidding yourself

For most of us working + investing in the space, our net worths are already extremely correlated to crypto prices"
2746,2020-10-11 18:57:59+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"8/10 At the same time, one shouldn't be afraid to let go of an investment if the thesis has materially changed. But this shouldn't happen more often during downturns

If anything, it should happen more during upturns as the investment becomes more expensive and therefore riskier"
2747,2020-10-11 18:57:59+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"7/10 After all, price is just a single and often extremely noisy, data point about an investment. Its movements up or down should not meaningfully impact the thesis

Beware of the rationalisations for selling that spring up during downturns"
2748,2020-10-11 18:57:59+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"6/10 At best, drawdowns can help prompt one to question the thesis and (hopefully) come back more convicted

Occasionally they may prompt a reevaluation of the thesis, but if one is investing based on fundamentals this should imo be rare"
2749,2020-10-11 18:57:58+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"5/10 No matter what anyone tells you, 50%+ drawdowns are no fun

However, the fundamentals themselves rarely change that much in such short periods of time and so neither should one's investments"
2750,2020-10-11 18:57:58+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"4/10 Obviously, one should take advantage of this liquidity as it allows for rebalancing. Most importantly, it also makes outcomes less binary and thus less volatile than traditional VC

However, one should not let the liquidity take advantage of us"
2751,2020-10-11 18:57:57+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"3/10 A look at any of the best performing public stocks will show you that you cannot have 10-1000x upside potential without volatiliy and occasional large drawdowns 

Crypto, as early stage tech, is much riskier than established public companies and thus even higher vol too"
2752,2020-10-11 18:57:57+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"2/10 As with all early stage tech, realising these outcomes will require 4-8 year holds

Unlike early stage tech, crypto investors will have liquidity, i.e. the possibility, and thus the temptation, to sell  

This is both a blessing and a curse"
2753,2020-10-11 18:57:57+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"1/10 Imo, some DeFi projects represent 10-1000x upside opportunities

Obviously, like all of crypto, it is extremely risky and can go to 0. That said, given the magnitude of potential outcomes, it just doesn't have to succeed that often to make it a massively +EV bet"

2761,2020-10-08 22:01:18+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,My current thinking is that @AragonProject being one entity compromises one of most important features: being an independent third party / neutral middle-ground to settle disputes
2762,2020-10-08 22:01:17+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"What if one day the Court is asked to rule on a dispute concerning Aragon Network and a client? Less overtly, what if one of side of a court dispute is a large Aragon client and the other isn’t?"
2763,2020-10-08 22:01:17+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"I just realised there’s an additional pro to maintaining the multi-token model vs subsuming $ANJ into $ANT: Court Independence.

The Aragon Network is a DAO infra provider while the Court is meant to be a neutral third party and judicial layer for the broader crypto space"
2764,2020-10-08 12:52:39+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"This is huge since it enables @AaveAave to act as a yield aggregator, leveraging its $1.3B in deposits (the majority of which currently has underutilised credit lines)"
2765,2020-10-08 10:55:03+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"This is the best solution we've found so far for the Court and for @AragonProject  more broadly, creating a framework that can be applied in spinning out future assets.

Nevertheless, this is a preliminary, high-level idea and we welcome the feedback of the community!"
2766,2020-10-08 10:55:02+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"Under this proposal, the newly formed DAO would start with a hefty treasury of ~$12M, enough capital to bootstrap itself and implement the supply-side incentives described in our previous proposal 

Aragon Network would own 43.7% of $ANJ, giving it sizeable influence and upside https://t.co/0mVvm6mXAJ"
2767,2020-10-08 10:55:01+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"At a high-level, we see Aragon Court becoming the first of many independent, partially owned subsidiaries of the Aragon Network and $ANT holders

This gives the Court flexibility and sovereignty while aligning incentives with the broader Aragon Network via $ANJ token ownership https://t.co/7yPEskwqja"

2782,2020-10-06 10:31:56+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"Rather than identities, we see the rise of on-chain reputation like the one pioneered by @Dxdao_  but augmented with wallet activity, proxies for time spent on networks, Github profiles, public forum contributions, Tweet threads and other factors which make up a user’s reputation"
2783,2020-10-06 10:31:55+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"We believe the future lies in embracing the tools of decentralization

1) THORChain might still be the way to go BTC --&gt; renBTC

2) Where does demand for borrowing renBTC come from? To provide liquidity for BTC - ethAsset trading pairs on Ethereum. If THORChain exists, will this demand still be there?"

2834,2020-09-23 13:57:52+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"15/17 A protocol with a significant amount of integrations becomes very difficult to fork since these integrations must be built one by one and require time and trust

Security can be seen as the cost of undermining a protocol’s consensus: the higher the cost, the more secure the protocol is

2902,2020-08-26 11:53:43+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"(13/15) To be clear, we believe all AMMs have tremendous short and medium-term upside given the overall growth of DeFi and crypto markets more broadly 

However, it’s important to keep in mind the long-term dynamics and these projects’ ability to establish defensible moats"
2903,2020-08-26 11:53:43+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"(12/15) In addition:

a) proposals like this are only possible because LPs are currently subsidised by 35%-90% APYs, a practice unlikely to be sustainable

b) the increased value extraction opens up opportunities for lower-cost competitors to gain market share"
2904,2020-08-26 11:53:42+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"(11/15) I use the example of Curve, which while extremely successful, is currently generating only a 0.73% yield for its LPs and 0% for CRV holders

Even if all fee income were redirected to CRV governance as per @Rewkang's proposal, this would represent a 0.073% yield"
2905,2020-08-26 11:53:42+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"(10/15) Given these networks are open and forkable 🍴, that both VCs and retail investors are content to continue subsidising governance token launches, it's likely competition will remain high

2906,2020-08-26 11:53:41+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"(9/15) While liquidity is a network effect/moat since it provides better execution (similar to how scale with airlines helps amortise fixed costs), any value extraction by governance token holders will immediately hamper execution and thus the size of their moat"

2909,2020-08-26 11:53:40+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"(6/15) As such, it must be accompanied by strong product-market fit, i.e. the ability to retain the liquidity generated

2911,2020-08-26 11:53:40+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"(4/15) Crucially, this means that a DEX’s customer is not the trader but rather the LP 

This being the case, in order to differentiate themselves, build a moat 🏰, and win their markets, DEXes must focus on owning their supply-side"
2912,2020-08-26 11:53:39+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"(3/15) Liquidity💧 is what's called ""undifferentiated supply"", meaning it is highly price elastic as most traders care only about best execution

2913,2020-08-26 11:53:39+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"(2/15) A similar phenomenon is happing with DEXes 

While initially users interacted with their favourite DEX directly, aggregators such as 1inchexchange, https://t.co/9QR7aFKpbP and others have emerged allowing users to get best execution on trades across all active DEXes https://t.co/6ABHVKIkYB"

3139,2019-10-13 18:28:44+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"Overall, it seems to me that if we reduce commitment costs and assume that a lower p(PostAttackPrice) might actually increase MEV due to the possibility of shorting, the incentives of the attacker and security model of BTC start to look a lot worse."
3140,2019-10-13 18:28:44+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"Relatedly, I also wonder about the assumption that p(followNC) will lower the MEV. While it will lower the MEV of a direct attack, it could correlate with lower p(PostAttackPrice) due to disruption caused to the network and thus increase the MEV of a BTC short position attack."
3141,2019-10-13 18:28:44+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"Given this, I'm not sure p(PostAttackPrice) will actually lower MEV or increase commitment costs as, depending on the type of attack, the relationship could actually be the opposite."
3142,2019-10-13 18:28:43+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"(2) is only true if you assume there are such a thing as ""non-repurposable assets"" which as I showed above is a pretty dodgy assumption as attacker can mine something else or keep mining BTC (assuming it doesn't die)."
3143,2019-10-13 18:28:43+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"(1) is only true if the attacker is seeking to profit directly via the attack. If the attacker is instead seeking to profit by shorting BTC, p(Postattackprice) could actually make mEV larger (multiples larger depending on depth of derivatives market and leverage)"
3144,2019-10-13 18:28:43+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"Another core assumption is that a lower ""p(PostAttackPrice)"" will: (1) reduce MEV (since the price at the attacker could sell the stolen BTC is lower) and (2) Reduce the value of the non-repurposable assets (since MR for the lifetime of the assets would be reduced)."
3145,2019-10-13 18:28:42+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"This being the case, these costs do not seem completely ""sunk"" to me which significantly reduces ""commitment costs"" figures and consequently reduces the hurdle rate for Miner Extractable Value significantly - making attacks much more attractive than the model currently reflects."
3146,2019-10-13 18:28:41+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"c) Even if hardware couldn't be repurposed, it's not clear to me that a DS attack would actually kill BTC (see ETC, BCH and XVG). If so, the hardware would not immediately become valueless as the attacker could continue mining on the (less valuable) but still alive BTC chain."
3147,2019-10-13 18:28:41+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,b) It seems to me even hardware costs could potentially be repurposed as we can imagine a scenario where a competing chain forks its mining algorithm to take advantage of the huge spare capacity that would be caused by BTC going down
3148,2019-10-13 18:28:40+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"However, I'm not sure this assumption is valid for a few reasons: 

a) the facility, PPA's and everything other than hardware are not sunk costs since these can be repurposed to mine some other coin"
3149,2019-10-13 18:28:40+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"Firstly, the security model seems to rely on a core assumption, namely the fact that miners face sunk ""commitment costs"" (facilities, hardware, PPAs, etc) and that roughly 50% of the total costs of mining are held in these non-repurposable, sunk cost assets."

3208,2019-06-28 17:27:57+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"@RyanSAdams @iamDCinvestor @jlppfeffer @jbrukh Ok, put another way: What's the advantage to these dApps of offering only ETH as collateral/SoV/MoE given that their users may be on other platforms and may not hold or want to hold ETH?"
3209,2019-06-28 17:18:50+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"@iamDCinvestor @antiprosynth Users of ETH as a SoV are currently users of dApps built ontop of Ethereum.

3210,2019-06-28 17:18:23+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"@iamDCinvestor @antiprosynth Users of the Ethereum network are the developers and they must indeed use (although not hold) ETH to use the network.

3212,2019-06-28 17:10:42+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"@RyanSAdams @iamDCinvestor @jlppfeffer @jbrukh I definitely agree this is the case right now, I just think this likely to become less the case in future as this infrastructure expands. I.e. Maker launching MCD, Bancor expanding to EOS, Aragorn building on Polkadot, etc."
3213,2019-06-28 17:06:53+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"@RyanSAdams @iamDCinvestor @jlppfeffer @jbrukh However, I also think it's plausible (and certainly more plausible than most Eth people give credit to) that we end up in a multi-chain, interoperable world where Ethereum could succeed as a network but not as an SoV, which is why I also hold BTC and SoV candidates (Decred etc)"

3215,2019-06-28 17:01:33+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"@iamDCinvestor @antiprosynth Amount of collateral required is purely a function of liquidity and related characteristics. ETH will only require less collateral because it is currently most liquid. There is no reason to believe this will always be the case, especially once WBTC or real world assets are added"
3216,2019-06-28 16:58:51+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"@RyanSAdams @iamDCinvestor @jlppfeffer @jbrukh Also to add to this, the third is the one that leads to most value accrual but also the one that is least correlated to Ethereum's success as a network. I.e. it's plausible to imagine a scenario where Ethereum as a network succeeds but ETH itself doesn't become an SoV"
3217,2019-06-28 16:54:39+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"@RyanSAdams @iamDCinvestor @jlppfeffer @jbrukh Eventually you could imagine something like mandating that X% of block rewards are burned in order to pay for security. 

Of course, to have any legitimacy this kind of thing would also require some kind of formal governance process."
3218,2019-06-28 16:53:14+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"@RyanSAdams @iamDCinvestor @jlppfeffer @jbrukh Importantly, this doesn't mean that it WILL be valuable, just that it needs to be for Ethereum to succeed.

As such, we can see security as a public good and just as in traditional economies, this must be subsidized through fiscal policy."
3219,2019-06-28 16:52:09+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"@RyanSAdams @iamDCinvestor @jlppfeffer @jbrukh That said, using your nation state analogy, one idea I've been toying with is the following:

Under PoS, for Ethereum to be successful ETH must be valuable since market cap is directly correlated with security, which is the main competitive advantage of using a blockchain."
3220,2019-06-28 16:50:05+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"@RyanSAdams @iamDCinvestor @jlppfeffer @jbrukh The third is its SoV use case and is, imo, the role that will lead to most value accrual. However, unlike a nation state, Ethereum cannot enforce use of ETH using violence. For this reason, in the future multichain/interoperable world many assets will serve this role on Ethereum"
3221,2019-06-28 16:49:43+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"@RyanSAdams @iamDCinvestor @jlppfeffer In addition, this differs from taxation in that while demand for dollars to pay tax is a % of GDP, this is not the case for ETH since the amount paid in fees does not necessarily relate to the size of the underlying economy. @jbrukh puts this well: https://t.co/kilvNGti60"
3222,2019-06-28 16:48:30+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,@RyanSAdams @iamDCinvestor The second is an MoE use case and will suffer from the working capital/velocity issue so eloquently outlined by @jlppfeffer (https://t.co/BaH5VZOvbo).
3223,2019-06-28 16:48:17+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"@RyanSAdams @iamDCinvestor I like this articulation too!

My critique of this is that of the 3 use cases, only the third (SoV) will drive significant value. The first is, as you point out, circular since returns are denominated in the native currency."
3224,2019-06-28 16:34:13+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"@antiprosynth @iamDCinvestor I don't see why ETH will always be a majority collateral asset for DAI nor do I think this is MKR's vision.

How do other ERC20's have custody risk? I agree the rest is far away, but a well-designed WBTC will also have minimal risk as will the future fully on-chain securities."
3225,2019-06-28 14:19:03+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"@antiprosynth @iamDCinvestor I totally understand this, but this is only the case right now when ETH is the only available collateral to issue DAI with. Once a multitude of other collateral is available (including real-world assets), what competitive advantage does ETH have as collateral?"
3226,2019-06-28 14:17:23+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"@iamDCinvestor I also don't quite get the significance of ETH being ""the only native digital asset for the network"". Could you expand a little bit here? In an interoperable, multi-chain world where all assets are available on all chains, why does this matter other than slightly reduced fees?"
3227,2019-06-28 14:15:39+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"@iamDCinvestor Dai is a debt coupon for ETH right now, but the ultimate vision of MCD is for it to represent a debt coupon for a variety of both digital and physical goods, of which ETH will be one. Why would people prefer to lock up ETH rather than other assets?"
3228,2019-06-28 14:11:14+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"@iamDCinvestor Hm, I think something like Dai (especially in it's multi-collateral version) is a far better candidate at being used as an MoE, UoA and even SoV within the Eth decentralized economy. 

I'm def a believer in that economy, but I'm not convinced a bet on ETH is a bet on that economy"
3229,2019-06-28 14:03:59+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"@iamDCinvestor This is true right now, but ETH has no competitive advantage in being used as collateral in DeFi. Once BTC, stablecoins and other assets are available, what is the reason for using ETH over alternatives?"
3230,2019-06-28 13:59:05+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"@iamDCinvestor I summarise some of those arguments here and also try to come up with some counter-arguments here: https://t.co/yGBkuUBBg4.

That said, I'd like to see much more effort put forth by the community in more clearly delineating ETH's long-term value capture."
3231,2019-06-28 13:56:58+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"@iamDCinvestor The unstated premise underlying this argument is that development activity on a network correlates with its value. 

I think there have been good arguments put forth by smart people about why this correlation may be far lower than initially assumed."
3232,2019-06-28 13:52:08+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"Thoughts? Did @VitalikButerin leave too early? Should he have waited for formal governance to be in place before stepping back? 

Or, is this seemingly chaotic process exactly how a decentralized project should function and the source of its competitive advantage?"
3233,2019-06-28 13:52:07+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"Now, it's possible that this ""rough consensus"" is simply how a decentralized project *should* be run.

However, I'd argue that, for a project like Eth which relies on rapid evolution/iteration, a centralizing presence is useful, especially absent a formal governance system."
3234,2019-06-28 13:52:07+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"However, I'd argue Vitalik's presence was a unifying force and his absence has left a hole in the community. 

State rent debate, Eth 1.X vs 2.0, Afri drama, dotETH, altETH, key contributors like Poon and Vlad leaving to start their own projects are all symptoms of this."
3235,2019-06-28 13:52:07+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"Ethereum governance - did we decentralise too early?

For a long time people's main complaint about Ethereum was that it was centralized around @VitalikButerin. He repeatedly mentioned he intended to take a back seat and recently has pretty much done so."

3335,2019-04-05 14:41:19+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"@spencernoon @jlppfeffer Nevertheless, I do think ETH is two separate and somewhat uncorrelated experiments: a technical experiment (Serenity roadmap) and an economic one (long-term value capture mechanics)."
3336,2019-04-05 14:38:00+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"@spencernoon @jlppfeffer While it's a convincing argument, I think most of the concerns can be mitigated through a mix of PoS and the fee burns Vitalik is considering implementing at the protocol level (https://t.co/r2syRgK7TD)which could lead to “well over 2/3rds of transaction fees paid"" being burned."

3339,2019-04-05 14:33:57+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"@spencernoon @jlppfeffer Since protocols will be frictionless, open-source and forkable, users will not need to hold ETH as they can easily acquire it when they need to use it and sell it straight afterwards, leading to extremely high velocity."
3340,2019-04-05 14:33:44+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"@spencernoon @jlppfeffer Given opportunity costs of capital, agents will always try and minimize working capital and the amount they hold will depend on friction, latency and uncertainty of replenishment (i.e. how difficult it is and how long it takes to acquire more of it)."
3341,2019-04-05 14:33:33+00:00,ZeMariaMacedo,"@spencernoon @jlppfeffer Basically, if an asset is used to pay for smart contracting utility, then it is working capital."
