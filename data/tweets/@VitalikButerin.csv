18,2022-12-30 15:03:16+00:00,VitalikButerin,"Another pattern I despise is insisting on a really important difference in meaning to words that sound like synonyms.

""complex vs complicated""
""money vs currency""
""decentralized vs distributed""

No. Stop. Let them be synonyms, use more specific words that clarify the difference."
19,2022-12-30 15:03:16+00:00,VitalikButerin,"Often when a word has a confusing meaning, the most viable path is to just stop using it. ""Fortnightly"" is too obscure; I'd probably just say ""twice per month"" and ""every 2 months"" (eg. ""your salary is $2500 twice per month"") directly."

32,2022-12-29 16:24:01+00:00,VitalikButerin,"@glenweyl I think my model is more, ""not being censored"" is level 1 on a Maslow-style hierarchy of info needs, and once that's reasonably satisfied, focus can and should shift to level 2, which contains ""not being info-flooded"".

33,2022-12-29 16:22:35+00:00,VitalikButerin,"@glenweyl I'm not convinced by the second sentence.

56,2022-12-17 19:09:18+00:00,VitalikButerin,"@GwartyGwart You should, but the scaling factor should be less than linear. Linear scaling leads to centralization, because of the inherent centralizing tendencies of the voting-with-resources game."

73,2022-12-16 11:33:38+00:00,VitalikButerin,"@DavidSacks The problem is the way in which the policies were introduced, seeming to retrofit around Elon's views on very specific situations.

202,2022-12-01 12:40:57+00:00,VitalikButerin,@kostascrypto I do think that mindset is going to change. SNARKs-as-black-box are going to gain legitimacy just because there's a huge network effect in gaining them legitimacy.

213,2022-11-30 17:41:03+00:00,VitalikButerin,@el33th4xor I think the latter is part of my framework. And my claim is that token governance privileges large holders over small holders.

464,2022-11-05 07:29:02+00:00,VitalikButerin,"@toghrulmaharram As written, yes, instant upgradeability is allowed if the 75% threshold is met, because if a security council can push through state roots then it can de-facto make upgrades.

All this prevents DoS attacks on the mempool."
683,2022-10-01 13:17:06+00:00,VitalikButerin,"ERC-4337, and its predecessor EIP-2938, do this by enshrining a split between ""validation"" and ""execution"".

The validation step is bounded in how much gas it can consume, and cannot use ""forbidden opcodes"" that access state outside the account. If an op does this, it is rejected"
684,2022-10-01 13:17:05+00:00,VitalikButerin,"Doing this securely requires a mempool node to be able to determine whether or not a given op is guaranteed to pay fees before rebroadcasting it.

This is quite hard to do, because it requires checking that the op does not depend on state that might change in the next block."
685,2022-10-01 13:17:05+00:00,VitalikButerin,"This is the gold standard that the existing public mempool provides. And we absolutely need to provide the same guarantees for smart contract wallets, or else we risk worsening centralization and censorship."
686,2022-10-01 13:17:04+00:00,VitalikButerin,"You should be able to send an op into a public mempool, and if it pays enough fees, reliably expect it to get included. This should NOT depend on ANY:

* Centralized actors
* Reputation systems for op senders
* ETH held in a separate EOA
* External services for account creation"
687,2022-10-01 13:17:03+00:00,VitalikButerin,"The big really valuable and necessary thing that ERC-4337 provides for account abstraction is a *decentralized fee market* for user operations going into smart contract wallets.

Pure tinkering is fast and effective, but it is unprincipled, so lacks large-scale legitimacy, so can only cooperate through centralization

2166,2022-02-05 16:26:39+00:00,VitalikButerin,"10. To be clear, I think there are important good things that come out of taking theorycel aesthetics seriously, and people who don't suffer for it. A really big one is credible neutrality:

2169,2022-02-05 16:26:37+00:00,VitalikButerin,"7. Crypto thinking about decentralization is similar. It's all about avoiding ugly unprincipled exceptions (in a centralized system, who gets to be the center?)

2170,2022-02-05 16:26:37+00:00,VitalikButerin,"6. The core instinct is: we need a formal system of rights and limits that treats everyone equally and doesn't make unprincipled exceptions.

3760,2020-09-02 02:54:43+00:00,VitalikButerin,"However, increasing capacity is hard to do safely. Ethereum nodes are already running near their limits and there is always the risk of DoS attacks that are much slower to process than regular blocks, slowing the chain to a crawl. Higher gaslimits would exacerbate this."

3762,2020-09-02 02:54:42+00:00,VitalikButerin,So what does work? Increasing transaction capacity. The fee level at which there exist 15m gas worth of willing transaction senders is higher than the level at which there exist 12.5m gas worth of willing transaction senders.

3764,2020-09-02 02:54:42+00:00,VitalikButerin,"Why? Suppose that this happens. Suddenly, when everyone is selecting ""465"" as their txfee, they are no longer *actually* paying 465 gwei, rather, they are paying 93 gwei.

3765,2020-09-02 02:54:41+00:00,VitalikButerin,"Here's a common class of ""solution"" that I hear to the high txfee problem: why not have (the protocol | the Ethereum foundation | Vitalik) just refund 80% of everyone's fees?

3766,2020-09-02 02:54:41+00:00,VitalikButerin,"The remaining transactors would see that blocks are partially empty, so if they lower their fees they would still get included. Hence, everyone would start lowering their fees. How low would they go? 465 gwei."
3767,2020-09-02 02:54:40+00:00,VitalikButerin,"Similarly, imagine everyone was sending transactions with 1000 gwei. A bunch of people would no longer find it worthwhile to send transactions, so they would drop out."
3768,2020-09-02 02:54:40+00:00,VitalikButerin,"So what would happen? There would be more demand than there is space, so people would start bidding higher and higher txfees. How high would txfees go until enough people drop out that the remaining users make up only 12.5 million gas? Well, we know the answer: 465 gwei."
3769,2020-09-02 02:54:39+00:00,VitalikButerin,"Suppose we were in a world identical to today, but where everyone was sending transactions with 100 gwei. At the 100 gwei level, everyone who would be sending txs today would still be sending txs, but there would also be many more who are willing to send at 100, but not at 465."
3770,2020-09-02 02:54:39+00:00,VitalikButerin,"First of all, why is the gasprice currently 465 gwei? Why isn't it 1000 gwei, or 100 gwei?

The reason is: 465 gwei happens to be the current level at which demand (the number of transactions people are willing to send) equals supply (12.5 million gas of tx space in each block)."

4257,2020-08-08 01:31:30+00:00,VitalikButerin,@Excellion But there's no guarantee that there will be any specific level of transaction fees. What if one month there's really low usage and the total tx fees are like $540?
4258,2020-08-08 01:23:28+00:00,VitalikButerin,"@Excellion If the chain dies, the coin dies. So IMO ensuring a minimum level of security of the chain, through a minimum coin issuance (which can be clawed back with EIP 1559-like techniques if there's usage), is the correct path."

4310,2020-08-06 00:38:59+00:00,VitalikButerin,@RyanTheGentry @hasufl The main reason why the code you're running matters is that it contributes to the coordination difficulty of switching the network to other rules (see https://t.co/dKve54pzMP). But if your node just accepts both the old and the new rules as in a soft fork then it doesn't do that.
4311,2020-08-05 23:41:57+00:00,VitalikButerin,@RyanTheGentry @hasufl In a soft fork the default is inaction and having new rules imposed on you without needing even an active confirmation. In a hard fork either you get active assent from most participants or all hell breaks loose. The latter seems better for protecting people's rights.
4312,2020-08-05 23:40:52+00:00,VitalikButerin,"@RyanTheGentry @hasufl Oh sure, soft forks better preserve the individual's freedom to not update their code, but I just don't get why that matters, when clearly the important thing is not what code you're running, but the rules of the network you're part of."

4682,2020-07-06 23:25:28+00:00,VitalikButerin,@DZack23 @bubbles_crypto Though I grant that there's a fine line here; if you take the logic too far you stop being a deontic libertarian and start being a Pigovian and then....

I would say that you should account for your use of roads by looking at the congestion cost you're imposing on other drivers and marginal wear-and-tear of your car on the road, but NOT at fixed costs that don't increase just because you're there."
4684,2020-07-06 20:56:31+00:00,VitalikButerin,@bemky Oh she certainly had lots of various flaws.

4689,2020-07-06 20:37:38+00:00,VitalikButerin,@bubbles_crypto Sure but deontic libertarianism does not recognize a duty to financially support systems you involuntarily benefit from. So it's not *hypocritical* for them to not take that into account when determining how much in benefits to claim.

4695,2020-07-06 17:35:01+00:00,VitalikButerin,@hasufl Initial clients literally had to run open-source scripts that scanned the bitcoin blockchain for purchases to generate the genesis.
4696,2020-07-06 17:34:32+00:00,VitalikButerin,"@hasufl That framing is inaccurate because the ETH wasn't premined then sold in any meaningful chronological sense.

5676,2020-05-20 19:22:41+00:00,VitalikButerin,"@udiWertheimer It depends on whether you're trying to keep a Pirate Bay-like app alive, or trying to keep a system with long-term active state running.

5677,2020-05-20 19:20:30+00:00,VitalikButerin,"@udiWertheimer But note that by going even this far you're losing a lot of the advantages of centralization. And it turns out that for whatever reasons, setting up such a chain is socially hard; after over half a decade of hype they don't exist yet."
5678,2020-05-20 19:19:09+00:00,VitalikButerin,"@udiWertheimer So I suppose you *could* build a consortium chain with some nodes run by Google, some by Huawei, some by (checks notes for European tech company) The Pirate Bay. And I agree that would be a step up in addressing all these concerns."

8330,2019-11-25 18:50:24+00:00,VitalikButerin,@musalbas The reason it's similar to politics is that blockchains are social systems and so our beliefs about their ability to satisfy any desired property depend critically on our beliefs about how humans behave.

8336,2019-11-25 16:37:25+00:00,VitalikButerin,@bramcohen The idea that cryptoeconomics is *just* about perfecting and building appendages around Nakamoto consensus is a profoundly conservative view of what cryptoeconomics can accomplish.

8917,2019-10-10 02:57:07+00:00,VitalikButerin,@KyleSamani 2x decrease to total throughput. The gain is native single-slot cross-shard comms so we don't have to bother with all this stuff about relayer markets and using layer 2 optimistic state for everything. Also complexity decrease.
8918,2019-10-10 02:52:59+00:00,VitalikButerin,@KyleSamani It increases *burst* requirements but not *sustained* requirements.

9392,2019-01-03 20:51:27+00:00,VitalikButerin,But YMMV.
9393,2019-01-03 20:49:20+00:00,VitalikButerin,I prefer YMYDYMYD. Happy 20001193!
9394,2019-01-03 19:54:31+00:00,VitalikButerin,Happy 10th birthday Bitcoin!
9395,2019-01-02 21:34:28+00:00,VitalikButerin,"@LyleJeremyRubin @glenweyl I think you read it incorrectly. If capital gets 30% of income and the 1% have 40% of that 30%, then the 1% now has 12%, and the proposed reforms would drop that to 8%."
9396,2019-01-02 20:21:34+00:00,VitalikButerin,@OGblockchain ~45% of the world's population lives in countries run by governments that are NOT democracies.
9397,2019-01-02 20:13:24+00:00,VitalikButerin,Open source advocates need to carefully watch this space and get ahead of the game. Don't want a future where our brain states get uploaded to Facebook and Google and wiretapped by national governments.
9398,2019-01-02 15:25:57+00:00,VitalikButerin,@glenweyl @dbergstresser Seeing why that's not true requires a nuanced understanding of how power is constrained by principal-agent problems and incentives.
9399,2019-01-02 15:23:56+00:00,VitalikButerin,"@glenweyl @dbergstresser Though one issue that I think our post addressed insufficiently is the ""they have all the guns anyway so everything administered by the government is equally centralized"" fallacy."
9400,2019-01-02 15:19:33+00:00,VitalikButerin,"@glenweyl @dbergstresser IMO pretty much everyone who speaks handwavily about ""centralization"" in politics should read https://t.co/YIAJ0GJwDj 🤣"
9401,2019-01-02 04:56:44+00:00,VitalikButerin,"@willwilkinson @N47H4N1ELJO5EPH @glenweyl @TuckerMattR @RadxChange It's still early days. Realistically, short/medium-term targets for rubber hitting roads include non-political applications (eg. https://t.co/UCJCPSeabG), obscure areas of policy (eg. spectrum auctions), and small innovative polities (think Estonia-like environments)."
9402,2019-01-02 04:53:21+00:00,VitalikButerin,@LyleJeremyRubin @glenweyl I thought Glen's ideas for capital are definitely partially socialized and definitely ambitious. What property are you looking for that COST and LR don't have?
9403,2019-01-02 02:08:59+00:00,VitalikButerin,@FomoErektus Simplicity is an incredibly important desideratum for algorithms and mechanisms.
9404,2019-01-02 02:05:32+00:00,VitalikButerin,@BobMcElrath @cyber_hokie @AFDudley0 @JTremback I'd say Plasma in general is https://t.co/dma24I0Mle's biggest success story.
9405,2019-01-02 01:59:35+00:00,VitalikButerin,@BobMcElrath @cyber_hokie @AFDudley0 @JTremback I honestly just fundamentally don't think .pdf latex papers as they are done today are necessary in all cases. For example I don't think our community loses much because there's no .pdf latex paper for Plasma Cash.
9406,2019-01-02 01:37:07+00:00,VitalikButerin,@lindsey_brink @glenweyl @NiskanenCenter Glen and I were literally in a debate in Washington a month ago where he (slightly me too but only as an audience heckler) argued in favor for of self-assessed taxation of electromagnetic spectrum licenses.
9407,2019-01-02 01:31:37+00:00,VitalikButerin,"@lindsey_brink @glenweyl @NiskanenCenter I don't think Glen is advocating for replacing the status quo with Harberger taxes on everyone and their dog, replacing DARPA with an LR gadget, and his brand of sponsored immigrant visas tomorrow. He's all for incremental experimentation in non-governmental contexts first."
9408,2019-01-01 19:19:43+00:00,VitalikButerin,"@AFDudley0 @JTremback The goal was never to ""crowdsource research"".... we just wanted to have a forum to discuss ideas with more permanence than telegram and less overhead than the insanity of having to make a polished 15-page pdf for everything."
9409,2019-01-01 18:42:33+00:00,VitalikButerin,"Increasing returns as the central challenge of political economy (very long tweet storm by Glen, please read!)"
