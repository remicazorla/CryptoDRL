5495,2019-05-12 16:47:59+00:00,mskvsk,@sanches_free I used some gateway (can't remember which one) to accept SMS payments. They solved the conversion issue. And seized like 30% of revenue as a commission. I was such a noob :)
5496,2019-05-12 16:00:19+00:00,mskvsk,@xchaotic I'd rather listen to a 60 kg guy who become 80 kg guy without anabolics than to a genetic miracle pumped with some extra testo. I love Arnie but I wasn't born like him and will never be like him. His tools and experience are useless to me.
5497,2019-05-08 17:41:50+00:00,mskvsk,"@levelsio In my 10 year nomad career I've burnt out twice. All I wanted was to crawl into some apt and never leave.

Longer stay affords a lot of opportunities: friends, deeper understanding of the place, it's more cheap. 

Definitely my choice nowadays. Or I'm just getting old, lol."
5498,2019-05-07 15:45:22+00:00,mskvsk,"@denismathenge Content suggesting service would have a great fit. With some content generation features, maybe.

However, there is some caveat here. One should know how to sell such apps as SMM tools are notoriously hard to sell."
5499,2019-04-23 16:35:39+00:00,mskvsk,"@berkanunal @levelsio 1. Burglars and terrorists have different motivations - one of them seeks publicity, another one tries to avoid it at all costs
2. Styles of attacks are also vastly different, burglars actually has to get out alive.

So, no. Apples to oranges."
5500,2019-04-23 09:07:17+00:00,mskvsk,"@levelsio I go out on a limb and say, that, perhaps, the places which are considered the safest are actually the least so. Terrorism feeds on fear and attacking the safest place yields the maximum fear and corresponding it publicity. This is exactly what terrorists want. Power through fear"
5501,2019-04-19 16:46:10+00:00,mskvsk,@JuynatorIsBack @efrainysalas @ericlbarnes On numerous occasions I had to check if a var is set and I didn‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs null. But that‚Äôs besides the point. Naming of an entity should reflect what the entity does. You might want to look to the most popular user note in the official docs https://t.co/iYnggmF35p

5503,2019-04-19 16:10:59+00:00,mskvsk,@efrainysalas @JuynatorIsBack @ericlbarnes Exactly. Or just make isset do what it‚Äôs supposed to do without any side effects and accompanying them hours of debugging üôÇ
5504,2019-04-19 14:05:00+00:00,mskvsk,"@JuynatorIsBack @ericlbarnes The naming of built-in functions is a disaster, just google it. Just one example, the isset function, which supposed to test if a var is set, but actually tests if it‚Äôs set and not null."
5505,2019-04-19 13:20:09+00:00,mskvsk,@ericlbarnes Love the language but its inconsistency is killing me.
5506,2019-04-15 10:26:17+00:00,mskvsk,@thepatwalls @bemmu One more supporting evidence. Even the conversion powerhouse like https://t.co/UKxP5IiYQ1 stopped using any forms of popups (at least I saw social-proof ones around 3 years ago for the last time) and all you can find on it is this modest form built in the flow of the page. https://t.co/cI59MhHEUt
5507,2019-04-15 10:09:21+00:00,mskvsk,"@thepatwalls @bemmu it was just a simple blue material ui sticky header with a larger green sign up button, nothing fancy

as far as i can remember, the conv rate drop compared to a popup was like 8-10% but the final revenue was still the same

the app in question was a small menu builder for VK"
5508,2019-04-15 09:05:16+00:00,mskvsk,"@thepatwalls @bemmu Anything, that doesn‚Äôt brutally interrupt UX. In mobile-first apps I usually go with a cta button fixed in a sticky header. In desktop ones, it depends on the layout."
5509,2019-04-15 08:49:33+00:00,mskvsk,"@thepatwalls @bemmu Let me also clarify, it‚Äôs not a moral high ground. I believe, more elegant ways of capturing leads actually give *more* profit. Precisely because, thay are (a) unobtrusive, (b) more modern and not burnt by constant use."
5510,2019-04-15 08:44:33+00:00,mskvsk,"@thepatwalls @bemmu Mostly, I agree with you, but I‚Äôd like to challenge the subscribers == money part. The quality of subscribers vary considerably, especially of those that were dragged into the subscription by such a rough method as a popup. We should optimize for the bottomline."
5511,2019-04-14 17:19:51+00:00,mskvsk,"@bemmu @thepatwalls Awesome chart! Yes, popups can give such effect. But it really boils down to the ultimate desired outcome of a campaign. I'm convinced that the quality of leads may vary considerably. Also, see my latest tweet re $5/month clients, the reasoning is pretty much the same."
5512,2019-04-14 10:47:06+00:00,mskvsk,@bemmu Popups is a digital analogue of the old car salesman meme. Work only for the audience that was hiding under the rock for the last 8 years or so and hasn‚Äôt been bombarded with popups from every corner.
5513,2019-04-14 10:44:42+00:00,mskvsk,"@bemmu I believe people has a knee-jerk reaction towards them and close popups before they even fully render. This is a very old tactic and people have developed a blindness for it. Especially, if a popup distract from the content they initially came for."
5514,2019-04-12 11:35:13+00:00,mskvsk,"@PhilippeLarche1 @levelsio Philippe, with all due respect, I don‚Äôt need any statistics. I have more than 6 years of interaction with Thai people, and about 8 years of nomadic lifestyle to compare. They are that friendly. Exceptions apply, though, as always."
5515,2019-04-12 07:44:23+00:00,mskvsk,@levelsio I‚Äôd even go as far as to tell that the Thais are superior to everyone else in terms of consistent politeness and non-aggressiveness.
