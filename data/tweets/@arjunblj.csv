2451,2019-01-02 16:11:21+00:00,arjunblj,"@mdudas @MartyBent @yassineARK It's not a useful word and distorts people's understanding of Bitcoin. Language matters intensely. I consider this thinking one of the reasons so many people have misunderstood Bitcoin (leading to Segwit2x and other great ideas ""for the community"")."
2452,2019-01-02 16:04:21+00:00,arjunblj,"@acityinohio All the claps, huh Josh? Sorry your mouse got jammed after 20. Looking forward to the other 30 when you get a new one. (Seriously though, appreciated!) https://t.co/v6PWKi609L"
2453,2019-01-02 16:02:21+00:00,arjunblj,"@mdudas @MartyBent @yassineARK The word ""community"" has all sorts of societal well-being and other connotations. Most people who use and hold Bitcoin (1) don't care about the debates we have here (2) even know much about it (3) don't care about governance dynamics or the technical roadmap."
2454,2019-01-02 16:01:24+00:00,arjunblj,"@mdudas @MartyBent @yassineARK Why do you need a word? These are just protocols (or money, depending on your view). What do you call people that use (and build businesses around) the dollar? US dollar maximalists? The US dollar community?"

2472,2019-01-02 05:44:30+00:00,arjunblj,"@TieshunR Right, but a payment token could be ETH (or other base layer chain), no?

Why does Handshake need separate miner security (v. bootstrapping another chain‚Äôs security model)?

Genuinely curious as it seems sub-optimal unless there‚Äôs a technical limitation I don‚Äôt understand."
2473,2019-01-02 05:39:43+00:00,arjunblj,"@TieshunR We‚Äôre both getting at the same thing, what problem in Handshake inherently requires a native payment token to work?

Based on the use cases of the token (specified above), I don‚Äôt why it couldn‚Äôt be implemented without it.

That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm trying to understand :-)"

2477,2019-01-02 03:48:11+00:00,arjunblj,@HassMcCook It's not a crazy idea and I've talked to others about similar but am generally opposed to proposals that (potentially) potentially violate private property rights. The problem is also non-urgent (though important) so I think we should wait to see how the fee market develops.
2478,2019-01-02 03:27:57+00:00,arjunblj,@BYOfuture Really appreciated Dan. High praise
2479,2019-01-02 03:22:27+00:00,arjunblj,"@TieshunR I understand the token is ""deflationary"" (given tokens used in the domain name auction), etc. but still don't understand why a proprietary token or a novel base layer chain is necessary for the project to function (and think a separate token makes the project worse)."
2480,2019-01-02 03:20:44+00:00,arjunblj,"@TieshunR I may be misunderstanding but from Steven McKie's write-up on HNS, these were the reasons listed for use of a token. Given they're all oriented around something resembling a fee token, which I don't understand the need for. https://t.co/fGIBvGxaGm"
