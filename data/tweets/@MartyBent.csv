3544,2021-12-27 16:21:55+00:00,MartyBent,"@JasonPLowery I understand why governments and militaries exist. No need for a history lesson. Again though, the US Federal government isn't too bloated and incompetent. An anachronism that is in need of disruption, which Bitcoin provides."
3545,2021-12-27 16:18:36+00:00,MartyBent,@JasonPLowery Sounds good. No need for you to come on if you don't want to. The proof is in the pudding though. The US Federal government makes life materially worse off for your every day American. Good luck spinning up a hash force.
3546,2021-12-27 16:11:25+00:00,MartyBent,@JasonPLowery No one is being debased when they pay bitcoin transaction fees.
3547,2021-12-27 16:10:34+00:00,MartyBent,@JasonPLowery That's a false option.
3548,2021-12-27 16:09:55+00:00,MartyBent,@JasonPLowery And you don't seem to understand what debasement means. Voluntarily paying for a utility is different than being taxed two ways (overt taxation and inflation) under the threat of violence.
3549,2021-12-27 16:07:59+00:00,MartyBent,"@JasonPLowery Miners are incentivized to provide utility because they have material losses if they don't. The US Federal government has become too big to fail. They can make mistake after mistake and suffer no consequence. In fact, they tend to double down on their incompetence."
3550,2021-12-27 16:06:20+00:00,MartyBent,@JasonPLowery The difference is bitcoin miners provide actual utility while the US Federal government makes life materially worse for most Americans.

6352,2021-05-19 00:47:57+00:00,MartyBent,@andrewjboone Rainy season in China is the best guess. Chinese miners are migrating to hydroelectric dams for cheaper power.
6353,2021-05-19 00:46:56+00:00,MartyBent,Compare this to PoS where there is only a sunk cost to stake. Once that sunk cost is deployed a validator need not do anything. This is a forcing function for centralization over time as there is no impetus to distribute the security mechanism (stake).
6354,2021-05-19 00:43:55+00:00,MartyBent,The never ending search for cheap electricity is an incredible forcing function that ensures Bitcoin mining is sufficiently distributed. Miners with high electricity costs are forced to sell their machines at some point to miners w/ low electricity costs as they cycle in new gen.

6408,2021-05-16 14:34:38+00:00,MartyBent,@La__Cuen The value for value model needs to mature significantly from a UX/UI perspective. Better paywall and tipping flows specifically. This will come with time. Adoption of BTC/LN being more widespread will help significantly too.

7657,2021-03-06 14:44:38+00:00,MartyBent,A multi-millennia history of using horses as transportation did nothing to stop the inevitable adoption of a better technology when it was brought to market.
7658,2021-03-06 14:42:41+00:00,MartyBent,The horse was the best and most efficient mode of transportation for thousands of years before the car showed up and obsoleted it as a vehicle in short order. #Bitcoin is going to quickly obsolete gold as a SoV the same way the car obsoleted the horse.

8914,2020-12-12 13:02:41+00:00,MartyBent,@mrauchs We‚Äôre just going to keep going in circles here as you seem too focused on semantics. Store of Value is a characteristic and function of money. It‚Äôs that simple. Leaving it out of the definition of money is dangerous and stupid. Have a good day.
8915,2020-12-12 12:58:52+00:00,MartyBent,@mrauchs When you neglect the store of value function of money you can have fun staying poor and stupid.
8916,2020-12-12 12:56:08+00:00,MartyBent,"@mrauchs At that point, no. And it got to that point because people neglected the store of value function."
8917,2020-12-12 12:53:28+00:00,MartyBent,@mrauchs It is most definitely a necessary condition as it affects the quality of the medium of exchange condition you are so focused on. People carrying cash around in wheel barrels probably wish their money was a better store of value.
8918,2020-12-12 12:47:12+00:00,MartyBent,@mrauchs And trying to rip store of value out of the definition is stupid.
8919,2020-12-12 12:44:04+00:00,MartyBent,"@mrauchs Yet there are a large number of people around the world using Bitcoin as a medium of exchange every day. 

Money has a static definition. There‚Äôs no debating in what it *is* - SoV/MoE/UoA. You can debate degrees to which different monies serve those functions but it is defined."
8920,2020-12-12 12:31:07+00:00,MartyBent,@mrauchs If you don‚Äôt think store of value is a primary function you are sorely mistaken. Capital accumulation and deployment is crucial in building productive economies. Money has to store value to make capital accumulation possible. You‚Äôre lost bro.

8922,2020-12-12 12:21:18+00:00,MartyBent,@mrauchs The Dollar is good medium of exchange but an absolute shit store of value. Focusing on one function and not the other is very misleading.
8923,2020-12-12 12:20:01+00:00,MartyBent,@mrauchs That‚Äôs complete hogwash. There are varying degrees of SoVs and one would hope their money is a better store of value than other assets. Glossing over this fact is doing anyone you‚Äôre trying to teach a massive disservice.

9644,2020-10-23 02:47:03+00:00,MartyBent,@brian_trollz @BobMcElrath I would flip that question on its head.
9645,2020-10-23 02:42:41+00:00,MartyBent,"@brian_trollz @BobMcElrath Roll in the tanks. Kill the operators. Doesn‚Äôt solve the lack of energy problem. Again, the producers have the leverage."

9648,2020-10-23 02:35:34+00:00,MartyBent,@brian_trollz @BobMcElrath I believe the producers have the leverage in this situation.

9651,2020-10-23 02:31:19+00:00,MartyBent,@brian_trollz @BobMcElrath I see the former happening and it will be driven by the economic incentive of energy producers wanting to secure their new revenue stream provided by bitcoin mining. ‚ÄúYou want the US to be energy independent?

9653,2020-10-23 02:25:13+00:00,MartyBent,@BobMcElrath @brian_trollz Mining is energy intensive. Energy will be provided by a large number of companies. These companies will end up owning their own independent mining operations.

9656,2020-10-23 02:21:14+00:00,MartyBent,@brian_trollz @BobMcElrath We already see this with differing flaring regulations from state to state.
9657,2020-10-23 02:20:46+00:00,MartyBent,"@brian_trollz @BobMcElrath Not sure I understand what you‚Äôre getting at.

10600,2020-08-08 01:12:03+00:00,MartyBent,@_prestwich @TiKawamoto @hodlwave I think today proved there is a concrete problem.
10601,2020-08-08 01:09:52+00:00,MartyBent,@_prestwich Supply is already 12% above where it was originally projected. People only seem to be getting *more* comfortable with the lack of supply cap.
10602,2020-08-08 01:08:02+00:00,MartyBent,@_prestwich @TiKawamoto @hodlwave Is pointing out how misguided they are not a form of protection?
10603,2020-08-08 01:03:48+00:00,MartyBent,@_prestwich At what point does a ¬±10% discrepancy become untenable? 150M ETH? 500M ETH? 1B ETH?
10604,2020-08-08 01:00:17+00:00,MartyBent,@_prestwich Agreed! But would love an answer to my question.

10614,2020-08-08 00:27:43+00:00,MartyBent,@_prestwich @tyneslol Why even add that friction with the plan for ETH 2.0? Doesn‚Äôt make any sense to me.

12577,2020-02-19 17:20:11+00:00,MartyBent,"@Truthcoin I know many people worry about it. Me, not so much."
12578,2020-02-19 17:18:17+00:00,MartyBent,@Truthcoin My argument is things *are* being invented that should aid the fee market.

Particularly, Jevons Paradox. 

Number go up. Bitcoin fixes this. Get over it."
12581,2020-02-19 14:04:53+00:00,MartyBent,"When you combine all of this, it is incredibly stupid to claim with any sense of authority that Bitcoin's long-term security is at risk.

The number of things one can do with a UTXO is increasing at an incredible rate. This utility will drive demand, and create a fee market."
12582,2020-02-19 14:04:51+00:00,MartyBent,"As oil and gas companies continue to wake up and realize they can use all of the FREE gas they are currently wasting on their fields to mine bitcoin, this will severely reduce the price at which your average miner can mine profitably. An externality that many are blind to atm."
12583,2020-02-19 14:04:48+00:00,MartyBent,"We haven't even touched on the future dynamics of mining, which provides the long-term security that people are so worried about."
12584,2020-02-19 14:04:47+00:00,MartyBent,"On top of this, it would be incredibly naive to think that these will be the only second layer technologies that come to market over time. One needs to factor in solutions that haven't even been thought up yet into their long-term Bitcoin security models."
12585,2020-02-19 14:04:47+00:00,MartyBent,"As these particular second layer solutions mature and become more useful to bitcoin users, this will also stoke demand for UTXOs that can be locked up and leveraged in more unique ways, driving up fees."
12586,2020-02-19 14:04:46+00:00,MartyBent,"We're only talking about technological innovations at the protocol level at this point. We haven't even mentioned second layer tech like the Lightning Network and Liquid, which also increase the utility of UTXOs."
12587,2020-02-19 14:04:45+00:00,MartyBent,"As the Bitcoin protocol continues to advance technologically (SegWit, Schnorr, Taproot, OpCTV, DLCs, assumeutxo, Erlay, etc.), individuals will be able to do more creative things with their UTXOs, which should stoke demand for UTXOs, driving up fees."
12588,2020-02-19 14:04:41+00:00,MartyBent,"This is pure demand for block space driven by speculation. 

Only one aspect that will contribute to the fee market and Bitcoin's long-term security as the block subsidy falls.

This is where Jevons Paradox comes into play."
12589,2020-02-19 14:04:40+00:00,MartyBent,"Bitcoin isn't on top of the public's mind like it was in the Fall/Winter of 2017.

If number continues to go up like it has consistently done for the last 11 years, this should stoke activity in the fee market as more people are dragged into Bitcoin's gravitational pull. https://t.co/zAf73uQTz5"
12590,2020-02-19 14:04:39+00:00,MartyBent,"Yes, Bitcoin's fee market may be paltry at the moment due to better use of the blockchain as individuals and businesses learn how to use block space more efficiently. I will concede this. 

However, one needs to look to where the puck is going."
12591,2020-02-19 14:04:39+00:00,MartyBent,Individuals who clamor on about Bitcoin's dwindling block subsidy and claim that Bitcoin's long-term security is in question lack vision and an understanding of Jevons Paradox.
12592,2020-02-19 04:02:08+00:00,MartyBent,"@JamesTodaroMD You know the systemic risk caused by interconnected financial products that were created to chase yield because individuals didn‚Äôt have a proper vehicle to maintain purchasing power over time?

16715,2019-01-06 18:16:45+00:00,MartyBent,"It's true, @BitcoinTina may be the most bullish Bitcoiner I've ever met on this site. Very stiff competition!"
16716,2019-01-06 18:02:38+00:00,MartyBent,"The future of Bitcoin will be paved with consumer plug and play hardware. The competition in this vertical is so hot right now, making me extremely bullish."
16717,2019-01-06 15:16:47+00:00,MartyBent,"As other projects attempt to dupe the masses with flashy bells and whistles, Bitcoin aims to be stripped down to its most essential functions. Ensuring it can survive and thrive in a distributed fashion long into the future."
16718,2019-01-06 15:00:00+00:00,MartyBent,Bitcoin is a distributed metronome for value transfer in the Digital Age. https://t.co/HVtN7rf3Rn
16719,2019-01-06 14:58:12+00:00,MartyBent,Bitcoin‚Äôs beauty is in its relative simplicity. This is hard for people to come to grips with.
16720,2019-01-06 02:52:17+00:00,MartyBent,At a bar right now and the shades in the corner look like @JonahHill is peeking in to say ‚Äúsup?‚Äù https://t.co/99CX8G9UV7

Who knows if we'll ever get there, but it is very encouraging to see these products coming to market and iterating so quickly. Onward!"
16729,2019-01-04 17:13:52+00:00,MartyBent,"@matt_odell The competition is beautiful and it is extremely beneficial for Bitcoin and the future of financial sovereignty. 
 
 Hopefully, more entrepreneurs see the paths paved by these pioneers and decide to jump in the fray."
16730,2019-01-04 17:13:52+00:00,MartyBent,"@matt_odell The proliferation of wallets like Wasabi, Samourai, and JoinMarket and hardware products like Casa, Nodl, and Dojo is lighting a fire under the asses of the people working on these products as they race to provide the market with the best, most user-friendly experience."
16731,2019-01-04 17:13:51+00:00,MartyBent,"@matt_odell As has been uttered in this rag many times in the past, I believe we are seeing UX improve at a steady pace across the industry due to all the different software and hardware projects competing to provide users with privacy tools."
16732,2019-01-04 17:13:51+00:00,MartyBent,"@matt_odell On top of this, he explains how to relay transactions outside of Internet Service Providers. 
 
 If anything, this guide points out the glaring need for improved privacy in Bitcoin and a better UX flow to make it easier for users to utilize these services."
16733,2019-01-04 17:13:51+00:00,MartyBent,"@matt_odell minty does an extremely thorough job, walking readers through ways in which they can attain bitcoins for cash, explaining the different privacy-focused wallets, and the underlying tech that works to ensure your UTXOs aren't easily traceable across the blockchain."
16734,2019-01-04 17:13:51+00:00,MartyBent,"@matt_odell As you can see from the above screenshot, our friend mintycosta does not give a darn about your political views or your thoughts on KYC/AML, he is only interested in equipping his readers with the best practices one should use when attempting to ensure their financial privacy."
