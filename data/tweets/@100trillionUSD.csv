2831,2021-08-30 19:54:15+00:00,100trillionUSD,"@DoctorLex Good point. Batching txs by exchanges would lower the number of txs needed to transfer amounts.

2842,2021-08-27 13:50:28+00:00,100trillionUSD,"@intocryptoverse I don't expect diminishing returns in the sense that average levels will be lower. Yes, S2F predicts 2x s2f = ~10x price. However, we can not use s2f reliably after s2f-ratio 100 (2024-28) because there are no other assets after real estate (s2f100/$100T). IMO $ will be replaced."

I guess s2f is my conservative prediction (which will go to ~$1M after 2024 halving) and s2fx is my aggressive prediction. We might end in between."

point is that btc price is currently ABOVE time model, so it is not illogical to expect lower prices if you follow time model. and btc price is BELOW s2f model, so it is logical to expect higher prices if you follow s2f."

6357,2020-04-06 15:57:22+00:00,100trillionUSD,"@BobLoukas @henry_popescu Yes that's correct. Even on-chain volume of 1M BTC/day dwarfs 1800 daily miner coins (0.2%). It is a valid argument that miner supply could thus be irrelevant. However, I assume that since price has not moved up/down but stayed at $7k for 2.5 years, volume had no effect on price."

Even looking at on-chain only there is 1M BTC traded daily, versus 1800 new BTC daily, only 0.2% so how can it have an impact on price. It is a good contra argument."

If BTC goes 2x that 50% will be 66% and they HAVE TO sell BTC and buy alts A and B to get back to 50/25/25."
