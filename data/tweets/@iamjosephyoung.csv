Well, think about it this way. [Not by their will of course], but these creditors saw BTC go from sub-$10,000 to almost $70,000 in the bull market, and come back to $20,000.

750,2021-02-27 21:12:46+00:00,iamjosephyoung,"It should also be noted that $VSP has some serious backers and advisors incl. Robert Leshner (Compound), Meltem Demirors (Coinshare), Ryan Selkis (Messari), Qiao Wang (Defi Alliance) &amp; Ian Lee (IDEO Colab Ventures)"
751,2021-02-27 21:12:46+00:00,iamjosephyoung,"In terms of governance roadmap, starting 6m from launch (so August 2021) the governance voting rights will start progressively being transferred from the team to VSP token holders so that by 12m later (Aug 2022), the project will be fully governed by the community."
752,2021-02-27 21:12:45+00:00,iamjosephyoung,"VSP has some serious room to grow, especially considering that the current Grow Pool products on Vesper are only the first of many, and that L2 integration and Earn Pools will be arriving soon."

755,2021-02-27 21:12:44+00:00,iamjosephyoung,The platform charges fees of 15% of pool profits + 0.6% withdrawing fees and 95% of these fees are used to buyback $VSP from the market and distribute as staking rewards to $VSP stakes.

758,2021-02-27 21:12:43+00:00,iamjosephyoung,"This professional and conservative approach, along with user friendly products where all complexity is abstracted away, is how Vesper will seek to reach mainstream adoption.

759,2021-02-27 21:12:42+00:00,iamjosephyoung,"Another seemingly minor feature that greatly improves user experience is that Vesper implemented EIP-2612 across all platform tokens, which means there is no need for a separate gas consuming transaction to ‚Äúapprove‚Äù each token before they can be transferred."
760,2021-02-27 21:12:41+00:00,iamjosephyoung,"And the multi pool approach means that each user-facing Vesper Grow Pool is a ‚Äúfront pool‚Äù while funds may be deployed to different ‚Äúback pools‚Äù, each with different strategies and risk profiles, allowing for better flexibility and risk diversification for the users‚Äô funds."
761,2021-02-27 21:12:41+00:00,iamjosephyoung,"Its modular architecture means that pools can easily transition between investment strategies without requiring smart contract upgrades or maintenance.

762,2021-02-27 21:12:40+00:00,iamjosephyoung,"Similar to other existing yield aggregators, Vesper allocates pool funds to different DeFi platforms (such as Compound, Aave, Maker‚Ä¶) in order to maximize yield based on different investment strategies.

763,2021-02-27 21:12:39+00:00,iamjosephyoung,"Vesper‚Äôs first product is an extremely user friendly ‚Äúset and forget‚Äù yield aggregator, allowing users to deposit USDC,DAI,ETH or WBTC into Grow Pools and earn yield on their deposits.

764,2021-02-27 21:12:39+00:00,iamjosephyoung,Vesper‚Äôs aim is to build a platform for easy to use DeFi products that will bridge the gap between the dynamism and ‚Äútest in prod‚Äù approach of the existing DeFi space and the professionalism and ease of use necessary for DeFi to reach mainstream adoption.

1388,2020-12-28 19:12:46+00:00,iamjosephyoung,"One positive development is that the shady exchanges in South Korea subsided.

There are now about 10 major exchanges operating in Korea. The crypto exchange landscape is simpler and much better regulated.
