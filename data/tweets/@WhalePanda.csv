535,2021-06-06 18:54:06+00:00,WhalePanda,"Fine, they didnt check if it was just a transfer. Idiots. Whatever.
Romania has its own system and doesnt follow the European standards. So Belgium is a yellow zone (PCR test required) and Germany is green (no test). Whatevs. I got the test."

844,2021-02-27 13:25:16+00:00,WhalePanda,@DanielaCambone Sure gold is still pretty and I gladly buy my wife some gold jewelry but as a real store of value it worked for a long time until something better came along and we have that now.
845,2021-02-27 13:23:47+00:00,WhalePanda,"@DanielaCambone Gold is, because it's very heavy and a physical good, very difficult to store/hide and very easy to confiscate. Just look at what happened in India.
It is not easily divisible and you need to be some sort of an expert to even see if it's real gold. It just isn't useful."
846,2021-02-27 13:23:34+00:00,WhalePanda,@DanielaCambone What's the total supply of gold? Do you only count the supply on earth or do you also include the supply on other planets and asteroids as there are even asteroids with such vast amounts of gold that it would instantly make the price of gold collapse. It's not scarce at all.
847,2021-02-27 13:23:09+00:00,WhalePanda,"@DanielaCambone parce que (switching to English sorry) if you look at the price chart of the last 10 years, you actually lost purchasing power if you bought gold 10 years ago.

Then there is the fact that only 150k of the original 850k (I believe) were recovered.
Then there is an ongoing lawsuit from Coinlab claiming they are owed billions."

The supply the first day was supposed to be 420k coins? So even 1.5 mill coins is a huge fuckup."
1736,2020-10-20 08:29:04+00:00,WhalePanda,"That large amount of Filecoin coins the first day were testnet coins that somehow were valid on the main net and were dumped on exchanges.

The 1.5 million $FIL transferred to exchanges right after the launch was shady af though.
Expect daily dumps for at least the next year."
1740,2020-10-18 14:47:49+00:00,WhalePanda,"The price started pumping, there was a huge demand coming from China, in July the 6 month vested coins were going for $7-8, this went up to $25 a week or 2 ago.
Most of the OG CT traders sold their coins/accounts before the launch because well we all know how this is going to end"
1741,2020-10-18 14:47:48+00:00,WhalePanda,"Since everyone is retweeting this Filecoin thread, I will too!
Friends and family price was $0.5 with 12 month vesting (iirc), the ICO price with 6 month vesting was $2.36.
For about 3 years the OTC price was pretty much $2-$3 until a couple of months ago.

2391,2020-05-15 11:47:31+00:00,WhalePanda,"Should I leave my coins on exchanges?
The obvious answer is ""no"". Some would say that if you can't take care of your own private key management you shouldn't own Bitcoin. I'd suggest to buy a hardware wallet. But if it's a small amount, it's fine, as long as it's a good exchange."
2392,2020-05-15 11:47:31+00:00,WhalePanda,"One thing to keep in mind in this space is that it often feels like 50% are scammers, 45% are crazy and maybe 5% seem relatively normal.
Reason that there are so many scammers is because you're dealing with money and non-reversible transactions with a certain level of anonimity."
2393,2020-05-15 11:47:31+00:00,WhalePanda,"If the answer is ""yes"" then sure, go for it, but then you have to pay the fee to pay for the scarce resource that is block space, if the answer is ""no"" then you can always use layer 2 solutions. You're completely free to do whatever you want."
2394,2020-05-15 11:47:30+00:00,WhalePanda,"Layer 2 will also help with reducing the fees for more transactions going forward. There is so much development in this space that it's really quite exciting.
A question you should ask yourself is if your coffee $2 purchase should forever be stored on the BTC blockchain."
2395,2020-05-15 11:47:30+00:00,WhalePanda,"Keep in mind that the block reward is ""only"" 6.25 BTC we actually need fees to pay to miners to keep the security of Bitcoin as high as possible. Another important thing is that fees are paid in BTC and not in USD. So the higher the Bitcoin price, the higher the fee (in USD)."
2396,2020-05-15 11:47:30+00:00,WhalePanda,"Why are the onchain fees so high? Why not just create bigger blocks?
The bigger the blocks, the more centralized the cryptocurrency. This should be an obvious one.
Block space is a scarce resource which use should be optimized. Many exchanges fail doing that."
2397,2020-05-15 11:47:30+00:00,WhalePanda,PoS has many issues but with every exchange now offering a stake service the complete centralization of it all should be the most obvious one for new people entering the space.

Bitcoin is the default currency, if you trade altcoins and end up with more USD but less BTC. You've lost money."

No, those who can't trade for themselves, teach (or run paid groups) since that's the only way they can actually make money in this space"
2403,2020-05-15 11:47:28+00:00,WhalePanda,"Should I trade? On twitter I see all these people who are claiming to make huge amounts of money
If you're already not 100% convinced if you should trade or not: don't. Even if you're 100% sure that you should trade I would still advice you not to. The majority of the people lose"
2404,2020-05-15 11:47:27+00:00,WhalePanda,"Is it too late to buy Bitcoin?
No, also: you don't have to buy a full Bitcoin. Don't invest money you can't afford to lose or might need soon. This is a risky investment.
Even if you decide to buy Bitcoin now, in a couple of years people will tell you that you just got lucky."

They're no longer limited by the amount of people they can seat at the restaurants, they're selling way more and on top of that they work with very limited amount of staff (no waiters/waitresses needed) which reduces the costs to operate."
