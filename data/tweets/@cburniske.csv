1563,2022-06-29 10:40:17+00:00,cburniske,"This makes some people think I‚Äôm short, but I have *never* been short crypto in my life. 

I work to understand the markets to make my liquid longs as impactful as possible. 

Conviction in blockchains is uncompromising, accumulation is the long game."

1565,2022-06-29 10:40:16+00:00,cburniske,"There are venture scale opps in the liquids of crypto, and sometimes the opp is greatest there as private market valuations lag the liquids (like‚Ä¶ now)."

1568,2022-06-29 10:40:15+00:00,cburniske,"Locking up capital for a long time, whether VC or HF structured, implies lots of trust from the LPs, which is tough to earn (implies quality GPs)

Short lockups make raising capital easier, but‚Ä¶ easy come, easy go."
1569,2022-06-29 10:40:14+00:00,cburniske,"A nuance: fund structures are getting unorthodox. 

There are funds in crypto that provide good venture support, that have a more HF structure. 

Typically notable GPs, strict gates and decent length lockups are a marker of these."
1570,2022-06-29 10:40:14+00:00,cburniske,"As HFs get redemptions (which VCs in a closed-capital fund aren‚Äôt exposed to), they may also have to dump their positions at depressed prices to meet redemptions, making the bear even worse. 

Smart crypto native VCs would be buying in such a scenario, supporting their positions."
1571,2022-06-29 10:40:13+00:00,cburniske,"A HF that didn‚Äôt hedge may have a disastrous high watermark that they can‚Äôt get back to for years (no bonuses for yrs), not to mention as their AUM shrinks so too do their mgmt fees, and so there‚Äôs a negative feedback loop of declining compensation and potentially depression."
1572,2022-06-29 10:40:13+00:00,cburniske,"Structure of compensation in HFs (eg, high watermarks) are important to understand too. 

While a VC won‚Äôt get paid much of a bonus in a year like ‚Äò22, they don‚Äôt have to struggle with a high watermark or declining mgmt fees to pay people to do the work that is vital in a bear."

1861,2022-06-12 19:49:31+00:00,cburniske,"Also, planning for shock scenarios, and making sure that you always save capital for those scenarios.

I even plot some tranches that I don't expect to have to use (they're greyed out in my spreadsheets), and the position size will be a little smaller if not hit."
1862,2022-06-12 19:49:31+00:00,cburniske,"Getting disciplined with tranches, where your average price will be w/ each tranche, what your position sizes will be in $ and % of network terms, what multiples and cash on cash that gives you at future price targets, all helps keep you focused, optimistic, and sane."

Time and again, low-cost services have taken massive share within our economies. If you believe in the gospel of low-cost, then you better believe in the promise of cypher-space provisioned services over the long-run."
5659,2020-06-22 14:52:03+00:00,cburniske,"COST-SUPERIORITY:  I expect the margins of these miners to look similar to electric utilities once BTC is fixed-supply, socially de-risked, and a massively used transactional network.

Decisions will also need to be made about how decisions will be made.

The rest of my tweets re: this episode of crypto drama related to seeking the data on Pomp's strategy, which we got from @sassal0x, and now there's transparency.

From here, it's a value judgment &amp; to each their own."
7167,2019-03-03 18:41:18+00:00,cburniske,"16/ So thank your fellow dev &amp; fringe-user, and educate the mainstream user about the novelness or cost-savings or earnings of crypto services. 

Ideologies may seep in as you educate, and the mainstream may be drawn to wander down those paths, but don't lead w/ the ideology."
7168,2019-03-03 18:35:40+00:00,cburniske,"15/ And that's okay. Fringe users have the patience to work with the developers to iterate on services that will incrementally convert the mainstream into users. 

The mainstream won't have that patience -- things will need to ""just work,"" and reliably so."
7169,2019-03-03 18:31:51+00:00,cburniske,"14/ Either way, a lot of crypto's users today are the fringe--requiring the extra-incentive of an ideology to use crypto services--because despite great efforts and progress, crypto services remain much harder to use than Web 2.0 products."
7170,2019-03-03 18:29:49+00:00,cburniske,"@danheld Agreed. But early on it is fringe users that mainly help developers iterate towards the right services, with mainstream users incrementally converting based on usability / superiority / cost."
7171,2019-03-03 18:28:18+00:00,cburniske,"13/ And I'm not using ""fringe"" as a pejorative. I think a lot of great beliefs and values (maybe the majority?) could be considered to be held by the fringe. 

Or are maybe touted by the mainstream, but not felt deeply enough to move behavior?"
7172,2019-03-03 18:26:44+00:00,cburniske,12/ It‚Äôs the fringe users that care about ideologies and will convert to using cryptonetworks as much as they can for their respective reasons (myself included).
7173,2019-03-03 18:22:04+00:00,cburniske,"11/ In many cases, mainstream users won‚Äôt even know that part of the service they‚Äôre using relies on a cryptonetwork (or cryptonetworks). 

They‚Äôll just know they‚Äôre using a great or cheap service, or maybe even a service that earns them money for using it."
7174,2019-03-03 18:21:01+00:00,cburniske,"10/ It‚Äôs novel services, or on-par services offered for cheaper than companies can, which will convert mainstream users to crypto."
7175,2019-03-03 18:20:22+00:00,cburniske,"9/ I don‚Äôt think crypto gets mainstream users through spouting ideologies to achieve psychological conversion. 

Conversely, I actually think such tactics, when done without taste, turn away the majority of mainstream users."
7176,2019-03-03 18:19:33+00:00,cburniske,"8/ All of this matters because the promise of a cryptonetwork‚Äôs openness is attracting excellent talent.

That talent will then build the best digital services and experiences over time, which is how we get the mainstream user."
7177,2019-03-03 18:19:05+00:00,cburniske,"7/ A cryptonetwork‚Äôs very functioning relies on all information being shared, open, and free, which dissolves the cut-off anxiety that devs suffer from with centralized platforms."
7178,2019-03-03 18:18:34+00:00,cburniske,"6/ And so devs are turning to crypto en masse, where access to the underlying network can‚Äôt be revoked."
7179,2019-03-03 18:18:06+00:00,cburniske,"5/ In contrast, mainstream devs lose access bc they build a great product that the centralized platform realizes is a good monetization opportunity / competitive.

All devs can see the unfairness in that, or at least that the deck is stacked against them."
7180,2019-03-03 18:17:28+00:00,cburniske,"4/ Censoring fringe users allows mainstream users to forgive or applaud the centralized platform‚Äôs control, and thereby continue using the platform."
7181,2019-03-03 18:17:09+00:00,cburniske,"3/ Many mainstream devs have already been burned by building on centralized platforms that cut access for competitive reasons.

While some users have experienced such loss of access, they tend to be users that operate more on a societal fringe, not the mainstream."
7182,2019-03-03 18:16:45+00:00,cburniske,2/ Devs are adopting crypto earlier because the ‚Äúcan‚Äôt-be-evil‚Äù of cryptonetworks matters more to them than it does to the user.
7183,2019-03-03 18:16:22+00:00,cburniske,"1/ Crypto‚Äôs not seeing mainstream user traction, but it is seeing mainstream developer traction, and the developers are the precursors to the users."
