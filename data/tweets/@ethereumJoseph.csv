We can realize the tech’s potential much faster, and with a far healthier architecture, than Facebook has proposed for Libra."
386,2019-10-23 21:22:22+00:00,ethereumJoseph,"See, for example, stablecoins such as $DAI, USDC, and USDT, which are price-stable financial instruments that have been remarkably stable even under challenging conditions."
387,2019-10-23 21:22:22+00:00,ethereumJoseph,"#Zuckerberg did say, “Our financial system has been stagnant and it’s not serving a lot of the people it needs to.” We agree. He said he wishes that “other people were trying to do different things, too.” We are."
388,2019-10-23 21:22:22+00:00,ethereumJoseph,"He did not say anything concrete about how distributed ledger technology and open wallets can help achieve those goals. Important distinction: #blockchain is not just #cryptocurrency. We are trying to rebuild systems around money, identity, and data."

390,2019-10-23 21:22:21+00:00,ethereumJoseph,"The good news is, the future I see will bring a waning dominance of the big, untrustworthy Web 2.0 companies of today.

391,2019-10-23 21:22:21+00:00,ethereumJoseph,The Libra story is about dominant technology players trying to shoehorn themselves into what is going to be the future of the internet. Possibly they see the writing on the wall and want to make sure they have a seat at the table when new technologies like #blockchain take hold.
392,2019-10-23 21:22:21+00:00,ethereumJoseph,"How they propose to achieve that with a consortium of a few dozen mega-corporations at the helm is less clear––to say nothing of their own track record with the public’s data and privacy rights, issues many on the Committee similarly raised."
393,2019-10-23 21:22:20+00:00,ethereumJoseph,Mark #Zuckerberg talks about @Libra_ in terms that are quite familiar (and validating) to the people already building blockchain systems: broadening financial inclusion &amp; fixing a broken financial system.
394,2019-10-23 21:22:20+00:00,ethereumJoseph,Then it can derive even more value from that critical financial and spending data. This is Facebook’s core modus operandi. Facebook brings people together. It also brings all of their disparate data together into a single profile that can be optimally monetized.
395,2019-10-23 21:22:20+00:00,ethereumJoseph,"Despite what they’ve said, I expect eventually Facebook will link the deep individualized data from its advertising technology to the personal financial transactions and histories held in the @Calibra wallet, just as they’ve integrated data from other platforms they’ve acquired."
396,2019-10-23 21:22:20+00:00,ethereumJoseph,"Facebook has a huge agenda here. They, along with the companies in the Libra Association, want to leverage its 2.3 billion global citizenry into their own monetary &amp; payments jurisdiction, a massive business and geopolitical opportunity."
397,2019-10-23 21:22:19+00:00,ethereumJoseph,"It’s not exactly an antitrust issue, it’s an anti-humanity issue."
398,2019-10-23 21:22:19+00:00,ethereumJoseph,"Facebook deploys various aspects of advertising technology to exploit people’s personal information and attention, and as a negative externality has become a weapon of mass social manipulation."
399,2019-10-23 21:22:19+00:00,ethereumJoseph,"@Facebook, with 2.3 billion users, and the track record it has, leading a project like Libra is a problem."
400,2019-10-23 21:22:18+00:00,ethereumJoseph,"A project and technology like Libra shouldn’t be controversial on the surface; other companies are working on similar projects, including @MakerDAO and @JPMorgan. If @Facebook weren’t involved, very few would be paying attention."
401,2019-10-23 21:22:18+00:00,ethereumJoseph,"It’s important to explore price-stable currencies, pegged to the value of another asset or assets. We’re moving into an era where the monetary systems of the world are challenged, and this tech can enable potential solutions."
402,2019-10-23 21:22:18+00:00,ethereumJoseph,"First, some context: I think the #blockchain space benefits from experimentation, including the @Libra_ project. What does not benefit the space is a Facebook-led blockchain project, led in typical @Facebook style."
403,2019-10-23 14:36:30+00:00,ethereumJoseph,"Ultimately, the project should not serve as a referendum on the viability of #blockchain-based systems as a whole, which I continue to believe is going to restructure our society for the better."
404,2019-10-23 14:36:29+00:00,ethereumJoseph,"The question we should be asking ourselves isn’t “is Libra good or bad?” Rather, it is whether @Libra_ can live up to the promise of decentralized protocol technology."
