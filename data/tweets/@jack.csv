which is why one should be able to choose if they use an algo or not, and which one. simple solution to all this."

575,2022-04-29 20:40:31+00:00,jack,"*it’s also crazy and wrong that individuals or companies bear this responsibility. As I’ve said before, I don’t believe any permanent ban (with the exception of illegal activity) is right, or should be possible. This is why we need a protocol that’s resilient to the layers above."
576,2022-04-29 20:40:29+00:00,jack,"Doing this work means you’re in the arena. Nothing that is said now matters. What matters is how the service works and acts, and how quickly it learns and improves. My biggest failing was that quickness part. I’m confident that part at least is being addressed, and will be fixed."
577,2022-04-29 20:40:27+00:00,jack,"Some things can be fixed immediately, and others require rethinking and reimplementing the entire system. It is important to me that we get critical feedback in all of its forms, but also important that we get the space and time to address it. All of that should be done publicly."
578,2022-04-29 20:40:25+00:00,jack,"I have tried taking a break from Twitter recently, but I must say: the company has always tried to do its best given the information it had.

Thank you both for getting the company out of an impossible situation. This is the right path...I believe it with all my heart."
583,2022-04-26 02:03:37+00:00,jack,"In principle, I don’t believe anyone should own or run Twitter. It wants to be a public good at a protocol level, not a company. Solving for the problem of it being a company however, Elon is the singular solution I trust. I trust his mission to extend the light of consciousness."
584,2022-04-26 02:03:36+00:00,jack,"The idea and service is all that matters to me, and I will do whatever it takes to protect both. Twitter as a company has always been my sole issue and my biggest regret. It has been owned by Wall Street and the ad model. Taking it back from Wall Street is the correct first step."

1017,2021-10-15 20:29:41+00:00,jack,5/Mining isn’t accessible to everyone. Bitcoin mining should be as easy as plugging a rig into a power source. There isn’t enough incentive today for individuals to overcome the complexity of running a miner for themselves. What are the biggest barriers for people running miners?
1018,2021-10-15 20:29:40+00:00,jack,"4/There isn’t enough focus on vertical integration. Considering hardware, software, productization, and distribution requires accountability for delivering to an end customer vs improving a single technology in the chain. Does seeing this as a single system improve accessibility?"
1019,2021-10-15 20:29:40+00:00,jack,"3/Silicon design is too concentrated into a few companies. This means supply is likely overly constrained. Silicon development is very expensive, requires long term investment, and is best coupled tightly with software and system design. Why aren’t more companies doing this work?"
1020,2021-10-15 20:29:39+00:00,jack,"2/Mining needs to be more efficient. Driving towards clean and efficient energy use is great for Bitcoin’s economics, impact, and scalability. Energy is a system-level problem that requires innovation in silicon, software, and integration. What are the largest opportunities here?"
1021,2021-10-15 20:29:39+00:00,jack,"1/Mining needs to be more distributed. The core job of a miner is to securely settle transactions without the need for trusted 3rd parties. This is critical well after the last bitcoin is mined. The more decentralized this is, the more resilient the Bitcoin network becomes. True?"
1022,2021-10-15 20:29:38+00:00,jack,"Square is considering building a Bitcoin mining system based on custom silicon and open source for individuals and businesses worldwide. If we do this, we’d follow our hardware wallet model: build in the open in collaboration with the community. First some thoughts and questions."

1286,2021-06-04 15:42:43+00:00,jack,"5/Mobile devices are a huge liability. An always-in-your-pocket device will never be safe enough to be solely responsible for your bitcoin. Whether through accidental loss, theft, or in worst cases coercion, having some friction here is beneficial. What’s the right friction?"
1287,2021-06-04 15:37:44+00:00,jack,"With that, @jessedorogusker, I, and team will listen and continue the conversation. And we’ll set up a dedicated Twitter and github account if we decide to build. We’ll update this thread with that information when we’re ready. Thanks!"
1288,2021-06-04 15:37:44+00:00,jack,12/Cash App integration is obvious for us but only part of the solution. A smooth experience likely depends on a custom-built app but it doesn’t need to be owned by Square. We can imagine apps that work without Square and maybe also without permission from Apple and Google. You?
1289,2021-06-04 15:37:43+00:00,jack,"11/Layer 2 is essential for growth. The orders-of-magnitude growth we imagine requires a mix of custodial, off-chain, and second layer solutions that allow people to ‘get off of 0.’ What tech investments can enable seamless, scalable, L2 native support for a hardware wallet?"
1290,2021-06-04 15:37:43+00:00,jack,"10/Trust can’t be required. Today, customers depend heavily on the continued function of infrastructure provided by 3rd parties. We want mainstream customers to be able to lean on us when they want to, but we won’t exclude those who don’t. How should we think about this flow?"
1291,2021-06-04 15:37:43+00:00,jack,"9/Are small displays necessary? Expecting mainstream customers to validate details on a small display is *unlikely* to increase security and *likely* to reduce device reliability, increase device cost, and decrease accessibility. Is the product better if a display isn't required?"
1292,2021-06-04 15:37:43+00:00,jack,"8/Today’s recovery mechanisms burn money. Customers have to protect recovery information from damage, loss, and theft and store secret(s). In practice, this is not yet mainstream-ready. We don’t want more passwords on post-its. What best of class solutions should we consider?"
1293,2021-06-04 15:37:42+00:00,jack,"7/Safety is complicated. For any wallet product, we consider safety failures to stem from one of three types of events: availability failures (“sunken gold”), security failures (“pirated gold”), and discretionary actions (“confiscated gold”). What threats are we missing?"
1294,2021-06-04 15:37:42+00:00,jack,"6/Blend availability and security.

We can probably simplify custody through “assisted self-custody.” Assisted requires great product design: minimal setup time, relying on existing devices, and end-to-end reliability. How should we be thinking about assisted solutions?"
1298,2021-06-04 15:37:41+00:00,jack,"2/“No keys, no cheese.” The exchange you used to buy your bitcoin probably attends to your security with good intent, but circumstances may reveal “custody” actually means “IOU.” Deciding to take custody, and security, of your bitcoin is complicated. What’s the #1 problem here?"
1299,2021-06-04 15:37:41+00:00,jack,1/Bitcoin is for everyone. It’s important to us to build an inclusive product that brings a non-custodial solution to the global market.

1332,2021-03-25 16:46:02+00:00,jack,"We appreciate the enormous privilege we have in building technologies to host some of the most important conversations in the world. And we honor the desire to create better outcomes for everyone who interacts with them. Thanks for your time, and I look forward to the discussion."
1333,2021-03-25 16:46:01+00:00,jack,One final note. We’re all a bunch of humans with a desire to make the world around us better for everyone living today and those that come after us. We make mistakes in prioritization and execution. We commit to being open about these and doing our best to remedy what we control.
1334,2021-03-25 16:46:00+00:00,jack,A decentralized open-source protocol for social media is our vision and work for the long term. We continue the cycle mentioned earlier of constantly improving our approach to content moderation in the short term. I hope our discussion today will focus on more enduring solutions.
1335,2021-03-25 16:45:59+00:00,jack,"Finally, it will allow all of us to observe, acknowledge, and address any societal issues that arise much faster. Having more eyes on the problems will lead to more impactful solutions that can be built directly into the protocol. Making the network far more secure and resilient."
1336,2021-03-25 16:45:59+00:00,jack,"Second, since the base protocol is shared, it will increase innovation around business models, recommendation algorithms, and moderation controls which are in the hands of individuals, rather than private companies. This will allow people to experiment in a market-based approach."
1337,2021-03-25 16:45:58+00:00,jack,"How does an open protocol address the concerns raised here? Greater transparency is the strongest benefit. Anyone around the world can see everything that’s happening in the network including exactly how it works. One doesn’t have to trust a company, just look at the source code."
1338,2021-03-25 16:45:57+00:00,jack,"We’ve started work on such a standard, which we call @bluesky. It intends to act as a decentralized open source social media protocol, not owned by any single company or organization. Any developer around the world can help develop it, just as any company can access its services."
1339,2021-03-25 16:45:56+00:00,jack,"So how do we resolve these two viewpoints? One way is to create shared protocols. Social media has proven itself to be important enough to be worthy of an internet protocol. One that a company like Twitter can contribute to, and compete on creating experiences people love to use."
1340,2021-03-25 16:45:55+00:00,jack,"This would also have the effect of putting enormous resource requirements on businesses and services, which will further entrench only those who are able to afford it. Smaller businesses would not be able to compete, and all activity would be centralized into very few businesses."
1341,2021-03-25 16:45:54+00:00,jack,"If instead we woke up tomorrow and decided to ask the government to tell us what content to take down or leave up, we may end up with a service that couldn’t be used to question the government. This is a reality in many countries today, and is against the rights of an individual."
1342,2021-03-25 16:45:53+00:00,jack,"Different businesses and services will have different policies, some more liberal than others. And we believe it’s critical this variety continues to exist. Forcing every business to behave the same reduces innovation and individual choice, and diminishes free marketplace ideals."
1343,2021-03-25 16:45:53+00:00,jack,"If we woke up tomorrow and decided to stop moderating content we’d end up with a service very few people or advertisers would want to use. Ultimately we’re running a business, and a business wants to grow the number of customers it serves. Enforcing policy is a business decision."
1344,2021-03-25 16:45:52+00:00,jack,Many of you will have strong opinions on how effective we are in this work. Some of you will say we’re doing too much and removing free speech rights. Some of you will say we’re not doing enough and end up causing more harm. Both points of view are reasonable and worth exploring.
1345,2021-03-25 16:45:50+00:00,jack,"Disinformation is a broad concept. We needed to focus our approach on where we saw the greatest risk if we hoped to have any impact. So we chose to focus on disinformation leading to offline harm, and three categories to start: manipulated media, public health, &amp; civic integrity."
1346,2021-03-25 16:45:49+00:00,jack,"Much of what we’re likely to discuss today are entirely new situations the world has never experienced before, and in some unique cases involve elected officials. And we believe the best way to face a big new challenge is through narrowing the problem to have the greatest impact."
1347,2021-03-25 16:45:48+00:00,jack,"Our process to moderate content is designed to consistently evolve. We observe what’s happening on our service, we work to understand the ramifications, and we use that understanding to strengthen our operations. We push ourselves to improve based on the best information we have."
1348,2021-03-25 16:45:47+00:00,jack,"We believe in free expression. We believe in free debate and conversation to find the truth. At the same time we must balance that with our desire for our service not to be used to sow confusion, division, or destruction. This makes the freedom to moderate content critical to us."
1349,2021-03-25 16:45:47+00:00,jack,"In our discussion today, some of you might bring up specific tweets or examples and I’ll probably have an answer like “my team will follow up with you.” I don’t think that is useful. I’d rather us focus on principles and approaches to address these problems. I’ll start with ours."
1350,2021-03-25 16:45:47+00:00,jack,"Thank you Members of the Energy and Commerce Committee and its Subcommittees, for the opportunity to speak with the American people about how Twitter may be used to spread disinformation, and our solutions.

We’re going to start small and focus on the most critical needs of artists and growing their fanbases."
1374,2021-03-04 13:04:22+00:00,jack,"TIDAL started with the idea of honoring artists by being artist-owned and led, focused on an uncompromised experience of the art. It's refreshing and right.

1375,2021-03-04 13:04:21+00:00,jack,"Square started 12 years ago by giving small sellers a simple tool in order to participate more fully in the economy and grow. We did the same for individuals with Cash App, which now enables a comprehensive set of financial services for folks who weren’t able to access it before."
1376,2021-03-04 13:04:21+00:00,jack,"It comes down to a simple idea: finding new ways for artists to support their work. New ideas are found at the intersections, and we believe there’s a compelling one between music and the economy. Making the economy work for artists is similar to what Square has done for sellers."
1377,2021-03-04 13:04:21+00:00,jack,"Square is acquiring a majority ownership stake in TIDAL through a new joint venture, with the original artists becoming the second largest group of shareholders, and JAY-Z joining the Square board. Why would a music streaming company and a financial services company join forces?!"

1401,2021-01-22 02:26:24+00:00,jack,"First step for @bluesky was a review of existing work: https://t.co/DJMm2SeE5R

We’re now interviewing candidates who ideally will run a new non-profit Twitter Inc funds, yet doesn’t control.

The alternative is to fund an existing project (or do both). That’s the next decision."
1402,2021-01-14 00:16:58+00:00,jack,"I believe the internet and global public conversation is our best and most relevant method of achieving this. I also recognize it does not feel that way today. Everything we learn in this moment will better our effort, and push us to be what we are: one humanity working together."
1403,2021-01-14 00:16:58+00:00,jack,"It’s important that we acknowledge this is a time of great uncertainty and struggle for so many around the world. Our goal in this moment is to disarm as much as we can, and ensure we are all building towards a greater common understanding, and a more peaceful existence on earth."
1404,2021-01-14 00:16:57+00:00,jack,"This will take time to build. We are in the process of interviewing and hiring folks, looking at both starting a standard from scratch or contributing to something that already exists. No matter the ultimate direction, we will do this work completely through public transparency."
1405,2021-01-14 00:16:57+00:00,jack,We are trying to do our part by funding an initiative around an open decentralized standard for social media. Our goal is to be a client of that standard for the public conversation layer of the internet. We call it @bluesky: https://t.co/51or6OuNNv
1406,2021-01-14 00:16:57+00:00,jack,"The reason I have so much passion for #Bitcoin is largely because of the model it demonstrates: a foundational internet technology that is not controlled or influenced by any single individual or entity. This is what the internet wants to be, and over time, more of it will be."
1407,2021-01-14 00:16:56+00:00,jack,"Yes, we all need to look critically at inconsistencies of our policy and enforcement. Yes, we need to look at how our service might incentivize distraction and harm. Yes, we need more transparency in our moderation operations. All this can’t erode a free and open global internet."
1408,2021-01-14 00:16:56+00:00,jack,"This moment in time might call for this dynamic, but over the long term it will be destructive to the noble purpose and ideals of the open internet. A company making a business decision to moderate itself is different from a government removing access, yet can feel much the same."
1409,2021-01-14 00:16:56+00:00,jack,This concept was challenged last week when a number of foundational internet tool providers also decided not to host what they found dangerous. I do not believe this was coordinated. More likely: companies came to their own conclusions or were emboldened by the actions of others.
1410,2021-01-14 00:16:55+00:00,jack,"The check and accountability on this power has always been the fact that a service like Twitter is one small part of the larger public conversation happening across the internet. If folks do not agree with our rules and enforcement, they can simply go to another internet service."
1411,2021-01-14 00:16:55+00:00,jack,"Having to take these actions fragment the public conversation. They divide us. They limit the potential for clarification, redemption, and learning. And sets a precedent I feel is dangerous: the power an individual or corporation has over a part of the global public conversation."
1412,2021-01-14 00:16:55+00:00,jack,"That said, having to ban an account has real and significant ramifications. While there are clear and obvious exceptions, I feel a ban is a failure of ours ultimately to promote healthy conversation. And a time for us to reflect on our operations and the environment around us."
1413,2021-01-14 00:16:55+00:00,jack,"I believe this was the right decision for Twitter. We faced an extraordinary and untenable circumstance, forcing us to focus all of our actions on public safety. Offline harm as a result of online speech is demonstrably real, and what drives our policy and enforcement above all."
1414,2021-01-14 00:16:54+00:00,jack,"I do not celebrate or feel pride in our having to ban @realDonaldTrump from Twitter, or how we got here. After a clear warning we’d take this action, we made a decision with the best information we had based on threats to physical safety both on and off Twitter. Was this correct?"

1471,2020-11-17 15:27:00+00:00,jack,"Thank you for the time, and I look forward to a productive discussion focused on solutions."
1472,2020-11-17 15:26:58+00:00,jack,"More than a year ago, the public asked us to offer additional context to help make potentially misleading information more apparent. We did exactly that, applying labels to over 300k tweets from Oct 27-Nov 11, which represented 0.2% of all US election-related tweets."
1473,2020-11-17 15:26:57+00:00,jack,"We updated our civic integrity policy to address misleading or disputed information that undermines confidence in the election, causes voter intimidation or suppression or confusion about how to vote,  or misrepresents affiliation or election outcomes."
1474,2020-11-17 15:26:57+00:00,jack,"Finally, before I close, I wanted to share some reflections on what we saw during the US Presidential election. We focused on addressing attempts to undermine civic integrity, providing informative context, and product changes to encourage greater consideration."
1475,2020-11-17 15:26:57+00:00,jack,"It’s critical as we consider these solutions, we optimize for new startups and independent developers. Doing so ensures a level playing field that increases the probability of competing ideas to help solve problems going forward. We mustn’t entrench the largest companies further."
1476,2020-11-17 15:26:57+00:00,jack,"Requiring 1) moderation process and practices to be published, 2) a straightforward process to appeal decisions, and 3) best efforts around algorithmic choice, are suggestions to address the concerns we all have going forward. And they all are achievable in short order."
1477,2020-11-17 15:26:57+00:00,jack,"Three weeks ago we proposed three solutions to address the concerns raised, and they all focus on services that decide to moderate or remove content. They could be expansions to §230, new legislative frameworks, or a commitment to industry-wide self-regulation best practices."
1478,2020-11-17 15:26:57+00:00,jack,"I hope this illustrates the rationale behind our actions, and demonstrates our ability to take feedback, admit mistakes, and make changes, all transparently to the public. We acknowledge there are still concerns around how we moderate content, and specifically our use of §230."
1479,2020-11-17 15:26:56+00:00,jack,"We did not have a practice around retroactively overturning prior enforcement. This incident demonstrated that we needed one, and so we created one we believe is fair and appropriate. https://t.co/uRzMa9i3S6"
1480,2020-11-17 15:26:56+00:00,jack,"We informed the @NYPost of our error and policy update, and how to unlock their account by deleting the original violating tweet, which freed them to tweet the exact same content and news article again. They chose not to, instead insisting we reverse our enforcement action."
1481,2020-11-17 15:26:56+00:00,jack,"We made a quick interpretation, using no other evidence, that the materials in the article were obtained through hacking, and according to our policy, blocked them from being spread. Upon further consideration, we admitted this action was wrong, and corrected it within 24 hours."
1482,2020-11-17 15:26:56+00:00,jack,"We were called here today because of an enforcement decision we made against the @NYPost, based on a policy we created in 2018 to prevent Twitter from being used to spread hacked materials. This resulted in us blocking people from sharing a @NYPost article, publicly or privately."
1483,2020-11-17 15:26:55+00:00,jack,"Thank you members of the Judiciary Committee for the opportunity to speak with the American people about Twitter and your concerns around censorship and suppression of a specific news article, and generally what we saw in the 2020 US Elections conversation."

1490,2020-10-28 14:19:42+00:00,jack,"Requiring 1) moderation process and practices to be published, 2) a straightforward process to appeal decisions, and 3) best efforts around algorithmic choice, are suggestions to address the concerns we all have going forward. And they’re all achievable in short order."
1491,2020-10-28 14:19:41+00:00,jack,We’re inspired by the market approach suggested by Dr. Stephen Wolfram before this committee in June 2019. Enabling people to choose algorithms created by third parties to rank and filter their content is an incredibly energizing idea that’s in reach. https://t.co/Oavx4xVskC
1492,2020-10-28 14:19:41+00:00,jack,"And finally, much of the content people see today is determined by algorithms, with very little visibility into how they choose what they show. We took a first step in making this more transparent by building a button to turn off our home timeline algorithms. It’s a good start."
1493,2020-10-28 14:19:41+00:00,jack,"The second is requiring a straightforward process to appeal decisions made by humans or algorithms. This ensures people can let us know when we don't get it right, so that we can fix any mistakes and make our processes better in the future."
1494,2020-10-28 14:19:41+00:00,jack,The first is requiring a service’s moderation process to be published. How are cases reported and reviewed? How are decisions made? What tools are used to enforce? Publishing answers to questions like these will make our process more robust and accountable to the people we serve.
1495,2020-10-28 14:19:41+00:00,jack,"There are three solutions we’d like to propose to address the concerns raised, all focused on services that decide to moderate or remove content.

1496,2020-10-28 14:19:40+00:00,jack,That concept of “good faith” is what’s being challenged by many of you today. Some of you don’t trust we’re acting in good faith. That’s the problem I want to focus on solving. How do services like Twitter earn your trust? How do we ensure more choice in the market if we don’t?
1497,2020-10-28 14:19:40+00:00,jack,"§230 gave internet services two important tools. The first provides immunity from liability for user’s content. The second provides “Good Samaritan” protections for content moderation and removal, even of constitutionally protected speech, as long as it’s done “in good faith.”"
1498,2020-10-28 14:19:40+00:00,jack,Thank you members of the Commerce Committee for the opportunity to speak with the American people about Twitter and §230. My remarks will be brief to get to questions. §230 is the most important law protecting internet speech. Removing §230 will remove speech from the internet.

2023,2019-12-11 14:13:15+00:00,jack,"This isn’t going to happen overnight. It will take many years to develop a sound, scalable, and usable decentralized standard for social media that paves the path to solving the challenges listed above. Our commitment is to fund this work to that point and beyond."
2024,2019-12-11 14:13:14+00:00,jack,"We’d expect this team not only to develop a decentralized standard for social media, but to also build open community around it, inclusive of companies &amp; organizations, researchers, civil society leaders, all who are thinking deeply about the consequences, positive and negative."
2025,2019-12-11 14:13:14+00:00,jack,"There are MANY challenges to make this work that Twitter would feel right becoming a client of this standard. Which is why the work must be done transparently in the open, not owned by any single private corporation, furthering the open &amp; decentralized principles of the internet."
2026,2019-12-11 14:13:14+00:00,jack,"Why is this good for Twitter? It will allow us to access and contribute to a much larger corpus of public conversation, focus our efforts on building open recommendation algorithms which promote healthy conversation, and will force us to be far more innovative than in the past."
2027,2019-12-11 14:13:13+00:00,jack,"Square is doing exactly this for bitcoin with @SqCrypto. For social media, we’d like this team to either find an existing decentralized standard they can help move forward, or failing that, create one from scratch. That’s the only direction we at Twitter, Inc. will provide."
2028,2019-12-11 14:13:13+00:00,jack,"Recently we came across @mmasnick’s article “Protocols, Not Platforms” which captures a number of the challenges and solutions. But more importantly, it reminded us of a credible path forward: hire folks to develop a standard in the open. https://t.co/1kH7UcaNKO"
2029,2019-12-11 14:13:13+00:00,jack,Some of these issues were emphasized by @stephen_wolfram in a blog post following his Senate hearing titled “Optimizing for Engagement: Understanding the Use of Persuasive Technology on Internet Platforms”. https://t.co/Oavx4xVskC
2030,2019-12-11 14:13:12+00:00,jack,"Finally, new technologies have emerged to make a decentralized approach more viable. Blockchain points to a series of decentralized solutions for open and durable hosting, governance, and even monetization. Much work to be done, but the fundamentals are there."
2031,2019-12-11 14:13:12+00:00,jack,"Third, existing social media incentives frequently lead to attention being focused on content and conversation that sparks controversy and outrage, rather than conversation which informs and promotes health."
2032,2019-12-11 14:13:12+00:00,jack,"Second, the value of social media is shifting away from content hosting and removal, and towards recommendation algorithms directing one’s attention. Unfortunately, these algorithms are typically proprietary, and one can’t choose or build alternatives. Yet."
2033,2019-12-11 14:13:11+00:00,jack,"twitter was so open early on that many saw its potential to be a decentralized internet standard, like SMTP (email protocol). For a variety of reasons, all reasonable at the time, we took a different path and increasingly centralized Twitter. But a lot’s changed over the years…"
2034,2019-12-11 14:13:11+00:00,jack,"Twitter is funding a small independent team of up to five open source architects, engineers, and designers to develop an open and decentralized standard for social media. The goal is for Twitter to ultimately be a client of this standard. 🧵"

2153,2019-10-30 23:11:40+00:00,jack,@waltmossberg @facebook Yes. And pointed that out in my thread. Addressing both at once compromises both solutions.
2154,2019-10-30 23:04:53+00:00,jack,@mdudas @_Kevin_Pham @geoffgolberg We are focusing on this. That’s why I made the point about root problems. Referring to organic.
2155,2019-10-30 22:05:28+00:00,jack,On issue ads...
2156,2019-10-30 20:07:08+00:00,jack,@fchollet We are
2157,2019-10-30 20:05:12+00:00,jack,A final note. This isn’t about free expression. This is about paying for reach. And paying to increase the reach of political speech has significant ramifications that today’s democratic infrastructure may not be prepared to handle. It’s worth stepping back in order to address.
2158,2019-10-30 20:05:12+00:00,jack,"We’ll share the final policy by 11/15, including a few exceptions (ads in support of voter registration will still be allowed, for instance). We’ll start enforcing our new policy on 11/22 to provide current advertisers a notice period before this change goes into effect."
2159,2019-10-30 20:05:11+00:00,jack,"In addition, we need more forward-looking political ad regulation (very difficult to do). Ad transparency requirements are progress, but not enough. The internet provides entirely new capabilities, and regulators need to think past the present day to ensure a level playing field."
2160,2019-10-30 20:05:11+00:00,jack,We’re well aware we‘re a small part of a much larger political advertising ecosystem. Some might argue our actions today could favor incumbents. But we have witnessed many social movements reach massive scale without any political advertising. I trust this will only grow.
2161,2019-10-30 20:05:11+00:00,jack,"We considered stopping only candidate ads, but issue ads present a way to circumvent. Additionally, it isn’t fair for everyone but candidates to buy ads for issues they want to push. So we're stopping these too."
2162,2019-10-30 20:05:11+00:00,jack,"For instance, it‘s not credible for us to say: “We’re working hard to stop people from gaming our systems to spread misleading info, buuut if someone pays us to target and force people to see their political ad…well...they can say whatever they want! 😉”"
2163,2019-10-30 20:05:10+00:00,jack,"These challenges will affect ALL internet communication, not just political ads. Best to focus our efforts on the root problems, without the additional burden and complexity taking money brings. Trying to fix both means fixing neither well, and harms our credibility."
2164,2019-10-30 20:05:10+00:00,jack,"Internet political ads present entirely new challenges to civic discourse: machine learning-based optimization of messaging and micro-targeting, unchecked misleading information, and deep fakes. All at increasing velocity, sophistication, and overwhelming scale."
2165,2019-10-30 20:05:10+00:00,jack,"While internet advertising is incredibly powerful and very effective for commercial advertisers, that power brings significant risks to politics, where it can be used to influence votes to affect the lives of millions."
2166,2019-10-30 20:05:10+00:00,jack,"A political message earns reach when people decide to follow an account or retweet. Paying for reach removes that decision, forcing highly optimized and targeted political messages on people. We believe this decision should not be compromised by money."
2167,2019-10-30 20:05:08+00:00,jack,"We’ve made the decision to stop all political advertising on Twitter globally. We believe political message reach should be earned, not bought. Why? A few reasons…🧵"

2511,2019-03-20 21:58:10+00:00,jack,"I love this technology and community. I’ve found it to be deeply principled, purpose-driven, edgy, and…really weird. Just like the early internet! I’m excited to get to learn more directly."
2512,2019-03-20 21:58:10+00:00,jack,"Why add a designer into the mix? I believe this is an underfunded area in the crypto ecosystem. Great design will help more people access this technology faster and better. And we want to see more work to educate, like this: https://t.co/3hBdEDLk3e"
2513,2019-03-20 21:58:09+00:00,jack,"Square has taken a lot from the open source community to get us here. We haven’t given enough back. This is a small way to give back, and one that’s aligned with our broader interests: a more accessible global financial system for the internet."
2514,2019-03-20 21:58:08+00:00,jack,"This will be Square’s first open source initiative independent of our business objectives. These folks will focus entirely on what’s best for the crypto community and individual economic empowerment, not on Square’s commercial interests. All resulting work will be open and free."
2515,2019-03-20 21:58:08+00:00,jack,"Last week I was considering my hack week project, and asked @brockm: “what is the most impactful thing we could do for the bitcoin community?” His answer was simple: “pay people to make the broader crypto ecosystem better.” This resonated with me immediately, so we’re doing it."
2516,2019-03-20 21:58:07+00:00,jack,"#BitcoinTwitter and #CryptoTwitter! Square is hiring 3-4 crypto engineers and 1 designer to work full-time on open source contributions to the bitcoin/crypto ecosystem. Work from anywhere, report directly to me, and we can even pay you in bitcoin! Introducing @SqCrypto. Why?"

2532,2019-03-12 23:04:59+00:00,jack,@lsanger Yes. We took a tiny step with the switch at the top of the timeline. Realize it’s small. But points to direction.
2533,2019-03-12 23:04:09+00:00,jack,@lsanger I don’t see why not. Need to understand “sync” more...
2534,2019-03-12 23:03:32+00:00,jack,@lsanger Think this was answer above. Yes. If we want to serve the public conversation (our purpose) we need to be more expansive than just what’s on Twitter. There’s real work here of course.

2655,2019-02-13 05:44:04+00:00,jack,@brucefalck No
2656,2019-02-13 00:32:20+00:00,jack,@mep No need to be sorry. I wasn’t
2657,2019-02-12 23:48:45+00:00,jack,"@karaswisher Go eat! Thanks, Kara #karajack"
2658,2019-02-12 23:46:43+00:00,jack,@karaswisher I don’t think you’re mean. Always good to experiment. #Karajack
2659,2019-02-12 23:46:03+00:00,jack,@RMac18 @karaswisher @finkd @waltmossberg NO RYAN
2660,2019-02-12 23:45:41+00:00,jack,@karaswisher Yep. And they don’t have to be wack. Need to figure this out. This whole experience is a problem statement for what we need to fix #karajack
2661,2019-02-12 23:42:56+00:00,jack,@karaswisher This thread was hard. But we got to learn a ton to fix it. Need to make this feel a lot more cohesive and easier to follow. Was extremely challenging. Thank you for trying it with me. Know it wasn’t easy. Will consider different formats! #Karajack
2662,2019-02-12 23:39:23+00:00,jack,@karaswisher @elonmusk @AOC Tried to do too much at once. Wasn’t focused on what our one core strength was: conversation. That lead to really diluted strategy and approach. And a ton of reactiveness. #karajack
2663,2019-02-12 23:37:51+00:00,jack,@karaswisher I’m focused on building leadership in both. Not my desire or ambition to be CEO of multiple companies just for the sake of that. I’m doing everything I can to help both. Effort doesn’t come down to one person. It’s a team #karajack
2664,2019-02-12 23:35:42+00:00,jack,@karaswisher @elonmusk @AOC I think it’s better to spread that responsibility across multiple people. It creates less dependencies and the company gets more options around future leadership #karajack
2665,2019-02-12 23:34:36+00:00,jack,@karaswisher @elonmusk @AOC Focus on conversation earlier. We took too long to get there. Too distracted. #Karajack
2666,2019-02-12 23:32:35+00:00,jack,@karaswisher @elonmusk @AOC True #karajack
2667,2019-02-12 23:31:00+00:00,jack,@karaswisher @elonmusk @AOC Totally. She’s mastering the medium #karajack
2668,2019-02-12 23:30:21+00:00,jack,@karaswisher I’m moving as fast as I can Kara #karajack
2669,2019-02-12 23:29:52+00:00,jack,"@karaswisher To me personally? I like how @elonmusk uses Twitter. He’s focused on solving existential problems and sharing his thinking openly. I respect that a lot, and all the ups and downs that come with it #karajack"
2670,2019-02-12 23:28:26+00:00,jack,@karaswisher @realDonaldTrump We ultimately decided we were better off independent. And I’m happy we did. We’ve made a lot of progress since that point. And we got a lot more focused. Definitely love the idea of opening more to 3rd parties. Not sure what that looks like yet. Twitter is close to a protocol.
2671,2019-02-12 23:26:02+00:00,jack,"@karaswisher @realDonaldTrump Always going to experiment with new models. Periscope has super hearts, which allows us to learn about direct contribution. We’d need to figure out the value exchange on subscription. Has to be really high for us to charge directly #karajack"
2672,2019-02-12 23:24:14+00:00,jack,"@karaswisher @realDonaldTrump We want to be valuable to people daily. Not monthly. It’s a higher bar for ourselves. Sure, it looks like a smaller absolute number, but the folks we have using Twitter are some of the most influential in the world. They drive conversation. We belevie we can best grow this."
2673,2019-02-12 23:22:11+00:00,jack,"@karaswisher @realDonaldTrump We should expect a lot more coordination between governments and platforms to address. That would give me confidence. And have some skepticism too. That’s healthy. The more we can do this work in public and share what we find, the better #karajack"
2674,2019-02-12 23:20:13+00:00,jack,"@karaswisher @realDonaldTrump We shared a retro on 2018 within this country, and tested a lot with the Mexican elections too. Indian elections coming up. In mid-terms we were able to monitor efforts to disrupt both online and offline and able to stop those actions on Twitter. #Karajack"
2675,2019-02-12 23:18:20+00:00,jack,@karaswisher @realDonaldTrump I think it’s more durable to focus on use cases because that allows us to act broader. Likely that these aren’t isolated cases but things that spread #karajack
2676,2019-02-12 23:16:57+00:00,jack,@karaswisher @realDonaldTrump Our work against automations and coordinated campaigns. Partnering with government agencies to improve communication around threats #karajack
2677,2019-02-12 23:08:54+00:00,jack,"@karaswisher @realDonaldTrump We hold all accounts to the same terms of service. The most controversial aspect of our TOS is the newsworthy/public interest clause, the “protection” you mention. That doesn’t extend to all public figures by default, but does speak to global leaders and seeing how they think."
2678,2019-02-12 23:06:13+00:00,jack,@karaswisher It’s the reality. We tried to do too much at once and were not focused on what matters most. That contributes to slowness. As does our technology stack and how quickly we can ship things. That’s improved a lot recently #karajack
2679,2019-02-12 23:03:21+00:00,jack,"@karaswisher We made something with one intent. The world showed us how it wanted to use it. A lot has been great. A lot has been unexpected. A lot has been negative. We weren’t fast enough to observe, learn, and improve #karajack"
2680,2019-02-12 23:01:32+00:00,jack,"@karaswisher I also don’t feel good about how Twitter tends to incentivize outrage, fast takes, short term thinking, echo chambers, and fragmented conversation and consideration. Are they fixable? I believe we can do a lot to address. And likely have to change more fundamentals to do so."
2681,2019-02-12 22:59:41+00:00,jack,@karaswisher @finkd I did. I’d rather be eating cheez-its #karajack
2682,2019-02-12 22:58:06+00:00,jack,"@karaswisher Feels terrible. I want people to walk away from Twitter feeling like they learned something and feeling empowered to some degree. It depresses me when that’s not the general vibe, and inspires me to figure it out. That’s my desire #karajack"
2683,2019-02-12 22:52:53+00:00,jack,@karaswisher @finkd @waltmossberg Ok. Definitely not easy to follow the conversation. Exactly why we are doing this. Fixing stuff like this will help I believe. #Karajack
2684,2019-02-12 22:48:05+00:00,jack,@karaswisher @finkd Does he check this much?
2685,2019-02-12 22:46:16+00:00,jack,@karaswisher @finkd Just resonded to that. Don’t see the twitter purge one #karajack
2686,2019-02-12 22:45:23+00:00,jack,"@karaswisher @finkd For instance, we look at probability of abuse from any one account. If someone is abusing one account, likely doing the same elsewhere. We can use that to potentially interstitial. #Karajack"
2687,2019-02-12 22:44:11+00:00,jack,"@karaswisher @finkd 1. Misgendering policy as example.
2. Using ML to downrank bad actors behind interstitials
3. Not too long ago, but most of our work going forward will have to be product features.
4. Not sure the question. We put an entire model in place to minimize gaming of system. #Karajack"
2688,2019-02-12 22:39:26+00:00,jack,"@karaswisher @finkd 1. We have evolved our polices.
2. We have prioritized proactive enforcement to remove burden from victims
3. We have given more control in product (like mute of accounts without profile pics or associated phone/emails)
4. Much more aggressive on coordinated behavior/gaming"
2689,2019-02-12 22:37:21+00:00,jack,"@karaswisher I think it’s fair and real. No question. Our org has to be reflective of the people we’re trying to serve. One of the reason we established the Trust and Safety council years ago, to get feedback and check ourselves. #Karajack"
2690,2019-02-12 22:35:12+00:00,jack,"@karaswisher @finkd Likely a reason. I’m certain lack of diversity didn’t help with empathy of what people experience on Twitter every day, especially women. #Karajack"
2691,2019-02-12 22:32:28+00:00,jack,"@karaswisher I think we tried to do too much in the past, and that leads to diluted answers and nothing impactful. There’s a lot we need to address globally. We have to prioritize our resources according to impact. Otherwise we won’t make much progress. #Karajack"
2692,2019-02-12 22:30:11+00:00,jack,"@karaswisher @finkd I see the link, and that’s why we need to put physical safety above all else. That’s what we’re figuring out how to do now. We don’t have all the answers just yet. But that’s the focus. I think it clarifies a lot of the work we need to do. Not all of it of course. #Karajack"
2693,2019-02-12 22:28:30+00:00,jack,"@karaswisher We action all we can against our policies. Most of our system today works reactively to someone reporting it. If they don’t report, we don’t see it. Doesn’t scale. Hence the need to focus on proactive. #Karajack"
2694,2019-02-12 22:26:50+00:00,jack,"@karaswisher Exactly. What can we do within the product and policy to lower probability. Again, don’t think we or others have worked against that enough. #Karajack"
2695,2019-02-12 22:25:40+00:00,jack,"@karaswisher No, not a police force. I mean we have to consider first and foremost what online activity does to impact physical safety, as a way to prioritize our efforts. I don’t think companies like ours have admitted or focused on that enough. #Karajack"
2696,2019-02-12 22:24:05+00:00,jack,"@karaswisher Within the service? Likely within replies. That’s why we’ve been more aggressive about proactively downranking behind interstitials, for example."
2697,2019-02-12 22:22:49+00:00,jack,"@karaswisher I mean off platform, offline ramifications. What people do offline with what they see online. Doxxing is a good example which threatens physical safety. So does coordinate harassment campaigns. #Karajack"
2698,2019-02-12 22:21:18+00:00,jack,@karaswisher Good question. This is why we’re focused on understanding what conversational health means. We see a ton of threats to health in digital conversation. We’re focuse first on off-platform ramifications (physical safety). That clarifies priorities of policy and enforcement.
2699,2019-02-12 22:19:33+00:00,jack,"@karaswisher This is exactly the balance we have to think deeply about. But in doing so, we have to look at how the product works. And where abuse happens the most: replies, mentions, search, and trends. Those are the shared spaces people take advantage of #karajack"
2700,2019-02-12 22:17:53+00:00,jack,"@karaswisher Second, we’re constantly evolving our policies to address the issues we see today. We’re rooting them in fundamental human rights (UN) and putting physical safety as our top priority. Privacy next. #Karajack"
2701,2019-02-12 22:15:55+00:00,jack,@karaswisher First and foremost we’re looking at ways to proactively enforce and promote health. So that reporting/blocking is a last resort. Problem we’re trying to solve is taking that work away. #Karajack
2702,2019-02-12 22:14:44+00:00,jack,@karaswisher Agree it matters a lot. And it’s the most important thing we need to address and fix. I’m stating that it’s a fail of ours to put the majority of burden on victims. That’s how the service works today. #Karajack
2703,2019-02-12 22:12:14+00:00,jack,@karaswisher Putting the burden on victims? Yes. It’s recognizing that we have to be proactive in enforcement and promotion of healthy conversation. This is our first priority in #health. We have to change a lot of the fundamentals of product to fix.
2704,2019-02-12 22:07:24+00:00,jack,@karaswisher A question we ask ourselves all the time. In the past I think we were trying to do too much. We’re better at prioritizing by impact now. Believe the #1 thing we should focus on is someone’s physical safety first. That one statement leads to a lot of ramifications. #Karajack
2705,2019-02-12 22:04:43+00:00,jack,@karaswisher Ready
2706,2019-02-12 22:03:54+00:00,jack,"@karaswisher To be clear, we’re interested in an experience like this. Nothing built yet. This gives us a sense of what it would be like, and what we’d need to focus on. If there’s something here at all!"

2726,2019-02-11 18:00:35+00:00,jack,@oliverburkeman I don’t have the details of every case. Nor do I make enforcement decisions. I was speaking broadly to the fact that a number of enforcement actions are because of things not visible on the surface (like ban evasions or coordinating multiple accounts).

1. It’s tappable. Fast!
