Honestly surprised by ETH's strength.

This is either a neckline retest or the entire down move was a shakeout.

The lower it goes, the more I get to buy.

Why would you bet on BTC being outperformed by altcoins (being long alt/btc) if you can bet on the entire market doing well (alt/USD)?"

17682,2019-05-15 16:24:07+00:00,CryptoDonAlt,@sersimovi No I expect alts to start doing well while BTC puts in a top. Not necessarily while it's dumping but it won't go straight up and straight down anyway it'll consolidate for a while
17683,2019-05-15 16:22:25+00:00,CryptoDonAlt,"@pdawg74 No. More like if you're Fomoing into alts better do it with USD. 
That way you won't get shaken out if ratios dump back down for whatever reason while still being exposed."
17684,2019-05-15 16:19:08+00:00,CryptoDonAlt,"The safest exposure to alts you can have right now are alt/USD pairs.
Alt/BTC has been underperforming due to BTCs moonshot and i expect they will continue to do so until BTC tops.

Once it does they'll catch up to BTCs run.
Very slim chance of getting shaken out that way."

Finally an impulse.
If today closes above resistance (4000) I'll be looking for buy opportunities/close my hedge short.
If it closes below resistance I'll be looking for shorts.
Dangerous to trade in any direction with the Finex maintenance coming up tomorrow. https://t.co/DBWj9wycvB"

If you think everyone needs to be in everything that is going up you're wrong mate.
If I followed every suggestion I've gotten this month alone I'd have zero money right now.
Appreciate the heads up regardless."

Monthly:

Still bearish, needs to break above 4500~ to even attempt a bullish recovery.

Weekly:

Rejected by weekly resistance but finally showing some bull momentum.
I'd like to see us start closing above 4300~ before turning bullish.

Daily:

God awful chop. https://t.co/p3wuONHP8w"
