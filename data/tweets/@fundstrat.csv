We expect markets to see Fed as predictable aka “data dependent”

- economy is resilient and so far absorbing hikes 

- rates will be increasingly restrictive as inflation continues to fall, so Fed can be predictable

- Back in 80s, this figure did not rise above 30% until Oct '82

Our Head of Technical Strategy @MarkNewtonCMT believes $SPX $SPY $QQQ made their short-term bottom yesterday right at support

- he sees S&amp;P 500 reaching 4,200 in the near-term

Reasons:
- Jan reflects seasonal hiring.  If Dec fewer hires, then Jan less

- Jobs not corroborated by wage gains, and Aug jobs strong then Sept softish.  Look at cos -- layoffs!

While EPS intuitively seems important, post a “negative year” it doesn’t factor in:

Price is SIGNAL so +75pt rally in S&amp;P 500 needs to be respected. 

- But HY + VIX term structure remain stubborn risk-off

- HY leads. It widened 1/16, 6 days before equity top. 

Still in correction camp, but with a narrowing margin. FY still bullish

This suggests economy could add 6-10mm more jobs before we get those dangerous wage inflation pressures of ECI 4%-plus.  (Employed ratio ~63%) https://t.co/2QwIMHX4OB"

Solid jobs gains shows US resilience and further strengthens case to buy stocks even at new highs

13155,2019-01-17 18:35:25+00:00,fundstrat,@bricejennings @carlquintanilla @MUFGAmericas Facts are not on that person’s side. The US is an independent driver of global growth. A macro shock can lead to a US recession (oil spike) but weakness overseas has not. US economic shock has always transmitted to a global recession.
13156,2019-01-17 15:18:17+00:00,fundstrat,@bricejennings @carlquintanilla @MUFGAmericas That is right. Never. Could happen someday. A global recession happened in 2015 but US avoided one.

13162,2019-01-11 15:09:52+00:00,fundstrat,"MACRO 3/ could be a retest of lows ala 1962 and 1987, but the bottom line—

Buy the dip is revived in 2019

(did fail in 2018, but due to a midlife crisis)"
13163,2019-01-11 15:00:21+00:00,fundstrat,"MACRO 2/ There are 5 arguments for double digit gains in 2019 (below) and these cover the gamut of key drivers:

Overshoot—60d
Cross market—HY
Valuation—PE derate
Sentiment—AAII soread
Internals—% PE&lt;15x https://t.co/oYYYJjyodZ"
13164,2019-01-11 14:21:24+00:00,fundstrat,"MACRO: Perhaps the simplest and strongest argument for double-digit gains in stocks for 2019.  

HY posted a decline in 2018 (never 2 years in row). 

S&amp;P 500 returns the year after a negative HY year? 

Average gain is 21% (below)...even 1988 saw a 12% gain (post ‘87 crash). https://t.co/OyPzVAwN3B"

13168,2019-01-05 17:23:53+00:00,fundstrat,@trinh_pham13 A retest happened in both 1962 and 1987 with 50-80 days distance between each retest. Doesn’t have to happen but could

Investor discounted inflation."
13180,2019-01-03 21:47:50+00:00,fundstrat,@PiszczakJ Here is the comparison of fed hike and cut probabilities pre dec FOMC and as of today — markets see no hike in 2019 now https://t.co/6j8hbIhz5I
13181,2019-01-03 21:44:47+00:00,fundstrat,@PiszczakJ Fed futures probabilities of a hike are now zero for 2019. And 53% of a cut by December. I think Fed will even address its balance sheet runoff soon
13182,2019-01-03 00:35:51+00:00,fundstrat,"@stockdriver2 Raising rates just cut them in the same year is not effective policy...not to sound glib, but if Fed issued true CBDC (true digital currency), they could effect monetary policy more directly."
