786,2020-10-13 13:43:22+00:00,riabhutoria,"What can we learn from this?

Avoiding allocation to ‘new’ or 'alternative' institutional investment classes runs the potential risk of missing out on improved diversification or substantial early-mover returns"
787,2020-10-13 13:43:21+00:00,riabhutoria,"However, bitcoin is fundamentally less exposed to the prolonged economic headwinds other assets will face in the next months and years

Combined with its multifaceted use cases, it could be a potentially useful addition to an investor’s toolkit"
788,2020-10-13 13:43:21+00:00,riabhutoria,"As bitcoin becomes more institutionally driven and if its narrative converges on a single thesis, it could become more correlated to certain assets, which could lessen its portfolio diversification benefits"
789,2020-10-13 13:43:21+00:00,riabhutoria,"Many investors believe bitcoin is very small compared to its addressable market and has significant upside potential

For example, if bitcoin were to capture 5% of the alternatives market ($13.4T in 2018 as measured by CAIA), that would add an incremental $670B to bitcoin"
790,2020-10-13 13:43:20+00:00,riabhutoria,"The reasons for bitcoin’s lack of correlation historically may include:
- Differing return and risk factors
- Dynamic narratives
- Lack of overlap between market participants
- Being retail-driven"
791,2020-10-13 13:43:20+00:00,riabhutoria,"While low correlation is an encouraging first sign in evaluating diversification potential, it is important to explore *why* an investment has exhibited low correlations to other assets and whether it will continue"
792,2020-10-13 13:43:20+00:00,riabhutoria,"To be an effective diversifier, an investment should have low or negative correlations to other assets in a portfolio

Bitcoin is one of the few assets that has been uncorrelated to traditional asset classes over longer periods of time"
793,2020-10-13 13:43:20+00:00,riabhutoria,"The rationale of certain investors for allocating to bitcoin and to alternatives may be similar – notably diversification and upside potential

And with benchmark interest rates globally near, at, or below zero, the opportunity cost of not allocating to bitcoin is higher"
794,2020-10-13 13:43:19+00:00,riabhutoria,"Additionally, thanks to central banks globally cutting benchmark interest rates to historically low levels, investors may be considering to which assets to shift funds that are currently in low yielding fixed income

https://t.co/EdZyUu4cCo"
795,2020-10-13 13:43:19+00:00,riabhutoria,"Interest in alternatives has grown as investors seek out new ways to reduce systematic risk and meet annual return targets

CAIA’s estimate of alternatives was $13.4T (12% of global assets) in 2018. Members expect alternatives to comprise 18-24% of global assets by 2025"
796,2020-10-13 13:43:19+00:00,riabhutoria,"Broadly, an alternative investment is anything that is not “traditional” (long public equities, debt, cash)

Attributes of alternatives include non-traditional returns (VC, art, farmland), unusual risk exposures (HFs), or non-traditional payouts (structured products)"
