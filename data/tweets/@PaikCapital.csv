2750,2022-05-09 14:22:40+00:00,PaikCapital,"6. Patience is a position

There is always buzz in the market and always something flashy and new. I've gotten chopped up chasing rotations and getting in too late. Patience to wait for a critical point in the market (large dump in a clear uptrend) to go risk on = positioning."
2751,2022-05-09 14:22:40+00:00,PaikCapital,"5. Denominate in strength

I'm not a fan of diversification (within the same segment of the market). Find the market winners and denominate in that (ex. ETH). If what you're trading/buying can't outperform the winners why bother? Let the weak go, double down on the winners."

Crypto is a community at the heart and there's so much going on you can't capture it all. Build a network where you can bounce ideas, see what's going on in different parts of the market, and help each other out. No one is better than the next."

here's my quick take on it:"

Focus on tokenomics that bring value to the token, not to pump the price of it."

I'm letting you guys dilute my rewards so if this was helpful please like + RT :)

I'll post even more strategies if this gets some traction!"
10046,2021-05-25 21:37:21+00:00,PaikCapital,"11. The math

It's a lot...I don't feel like writing it out but you'll see how crazy this gets.

Yes, I am currently doing this with some stables.

Yes, there are risks of contract exploits so DYOR.

This is just my strat, not to be followed without your own diligence!"
10047,2021-05-25 21:37:21+00:00,PaikCapital,"10. Big picture

You're:
&gt;&gt; earning deposit interests on Aave
&gt;&gt; earning borrow interests on Aave
&gt;&gt; earning deposit interests on Curve
&gt;&gt; compounding on Aave and Curve
&gt;&gt; becoming a farmer"
10048,2021-05-25 21:37:20+00:00,PaikCapital,"9. Compounding

Now in DeFi, you get rewards instantaneously so you can claim your Matic at any time.

You can either:
a) add Matic to the matic pool on AAVE and earn an additional 8% on that.

b) swap for more stables and rinse and repeat

Fees are pennies on Matic!"
10049,2021-05-25 21:37:20+00:00,PaikCapital,"8. CRV (curve) rewards

You can now deposit the 20k USDT into @CurveFinance's platform and earn 6.75% in USDT + 26% APY in Matic!

Yes, over 30%+ APY on your loan from CRV + the borrow interest you're already earning on AAVE.

Now we're really putting your money to work. https://t.co/ewjWBdRtB8"
10050,2021-05-25 21:37:20+00:00,PaikCapital,"7. cont.

Now, because I deposited more into the USDT pool the interest earned from my deposits will easily cover the interest needed to pay for the 20k USDT loan.

So what do you do with the 20k USDT loan you just took out?

It gets even crazier."
10051,2021-05-25 21:37:19+00:00,PaikCapital,"6. My borrow strategy

Let's say I deposit 20k into DAI, 20k into USDC, and 60k into USDT pools.

I have 40k as collateral where I can borrow ~20k USDT.

I'm earning interest on 20k DAI, 20k USDC and  *80k* USDT.

Instead of putting 100k to work, I'm using 120k now."
10052,2021-05-25 21:37:19+00:00,PaikCapital,"5. Why Borrow?

Don't forget when you deposit as collateral you also earn.

For USDT you earn 10% + 13% APY to deposit.

You pay 12.28% and earn 14.53% APY to borrow.

You're essentially getting paid a lot of Matic tokens to borrow on top of deposit."
10053,2021-05-25 21:37:19+00:00,PaikCapital,"4. Borrow earnings

&gt;&gt; the variable borrow APY is the interest YOU have to pay additional to your loan
&gt;&gt; the Matic % underneath is what Aave will pay YOU just to borrow
&gt;&gt; for USDT you can earn 14.53% APY in Matic just by borrowing (you have to pay 12.33% APY however) https://t.co/AUne93GRZS"
10054,2021-05-25 21:37:18+00:00,PaikCapital,"3. Deposit yield

&gt;&gt; just by depositing you can earn 4-23% APY
&gt;&gt; you earn 3-10% APY in native stablecoin + 3-13% in Matic rewards
&gt;&gt; I think Matic allocated like 40-50M in rewards for these Aave pools
&gt;&gt; without borrowing you'll earn these rewards in real time! https://t.co/tAWSjvVHVV"
10055,2021-05-25 21:37:18+00:00,PaikCapital,"2. Use @AaveAave to deposit funds on Matic

&gt;&gt; deposit stables
&gt;&gt; DAI and USDC are used for collateral
&gt;&gt; USDT cannot be collateralized but earns most deposit yield
&gt;&gt; you'll see why depositing into the USDT pool is advantageous even if you can't collateralize"
10056,2021-05-25 21:37:18+00:00,PaikCapital,"1. Bridge funds over to Matic

&gt;&gt; use their native wallet dApp
&gt;&gt; bridge some Matic (for fees)
&gt;&gt; bridge your stables (USDT, USDC, DAI)
&gt;&gt; takes roughly ~10 min in total"
10057,2021-05-25 21:37:17+00:00,PaikCapital,"Get paid to borrow money using this farming technique in the Matic ecosystem.

Right now you can only deposit $DAI.

But you'll also be able to deposit ETH and BTC in Alchemix v2.

Once that comes out I'll release a thread on why this is so powerful."
10593,2021-04-23 16:10:26+00:00,PaikCapital,"8. Worst case scenario

The $50k turns into $0 through alts (non-zero prob.)

Ok you either screwed up badly or the markets died.

Cool.

All you have to do is wait until the loan is paid off by your collateral and you'll be at breakeven."
10594,2021-04-23 16:10:26+00:00,PaikCapital,"7. Best case scenario

Did I mention you can repay the loan at any time to take back your collateral?

Best case is that your $50k in alts does amazing and maybe you 3x over the next few months.

Pay back your $50k (should be less by then) and walk away with $100k + $100k."
10595,2021-04-23 16:10:25+00:00,PaikCapital,"6. Strategy pt. 2

Because your initial $100k is earning yield and paying back your loan, you won't get liquidated.

You can essentially lose the entirety of the $50k and still be able to walk away with your $100k if you wait until the loan gets paid off automatically."
10596,2021-04-23 16:10:25+00:00,PaikCapital,"5. Strategy pt. 1

Say you want to be exposed to alts but don't want to put your capital at risk.

Put in $100k, take out $50k.

Put the $50k into whatever alts you want.

Maybe that $50k doubles or triples or maybe it goes down the drain.

No worries."
10597,2021-04-23 16:10:25+00:00,PaikCapital,"4. High APY

I won't go in detail but Alchemix uses yearn to generate yield.

That is currently 10-14% APY.

So how can $ALCX do 32%?

All unused deposits that are locked on the platform ($200M+) are also put in yearn vaults to earn interest.

Yield is distributed to all loans!"
10598,2021-04-23 16:10:25+00:00,PaikCapital,"3. Self-paying loan

Alchemix uses your collateral ($100k) and puts it to use in @iearnfinance vaults where they earn passive yield.

That passive yield goes to paying back your loan ($50k) for you automatically.

Current APY is 32%!

But how?"
10599,2021-04-23 16:10:25+00:00,PaikCapital,"2. Take a loan

Alchemix allows you to take 50% of your collateral value as a loan to yourself.

You deposit $100,000 you can take out 50,000 $alUSD which is Alchemix's stablecoin."
10600,2021-04-23 16:10:24+00:00,PaikCapital,"1. Deposit collateral

10810,2021-04-17 03:26:13+00:00,PaikCapital,"@SaaSWiz What I said was correct but it seems like their emissions are going to be extremely high.

If it's a constant 1000% APY they would have to dynamically change emissions constantly.

The initial APY will probably be like 25,000% APY  and when more users enter it dilutes down."
10811,2021-04-17 03:20:06+00:00,PaikCapital,"@SaaSWiz They're lowering the emission rate of reward supply.

It's a pool with XYZ amount of rewards per day.

Starts at 1000% APY but goes down as more people enter the pool.

If it was 1000% for everyone the price would immediately tank as whales accumulate and dump."

First IDO was already announced.

This gets more interesting day by day.

Congrats @CardStarter!"

Excited to the launch of the platform's features in the coming weeks!

The team has been doxxed, there was 0 presale, and backed by a huge blockchain ecosystem.

$BAG"
10970,2021-04-07 00:55:24+00:00,PaikCapital,"9. Connections

The biggest connection is that @wvsenterprise has management advising the @DeFiBonds project.

This is big.

Support from @wavesprotocol is huge."
10971,2021-04-07 00:55:23+00:00,PaikCapital,"8. Farming

To incentivize liquidity and usage of $USDap there are currently rewards for LP holders.

- Locking in liquidity for USDap-USDC for 3 months is yielding ~5500% APY.

- Liquidity for BAG-USDC is yielding ~3400% APY.

*expect these to go down when more enter the pool"
10972,2021-04-07 00:55:23+00:00,PaikCapital,"7. Governance token

$BAG is the protocol's governance token in charge of making decisions and incentivizing users to interact with the protocol.

Added bonus is that $BAG is ""supported by the real fiat liquidity gained by collateral of the stablecoin""."
10973,2021-04-07 00:55:22+00:00,PaikCapital,"6. Stablecoin

$USDap is the protocol's stablecoin which is pegged to $1 by pulling from several bonds with different terms, rates, and exp dates.

Bonds are old and relatively stable even in volatile environments.

The stablecoin is only issued with sufficient collateral in USD."
10974,2021-04-07 00:55:21+00:00,PaikCapital,"5. Off-chain protocols

- Traditional security accounting systems will be used for collateral locking

- Off-chain banks and brokerage accounts to settle securities and fiat interaction

- Usage of Bloomberg terminal and other pricing sources to interact with price oracles"
10975,2021-04-07 00:55:15+00:00,PaikCapital,"4. On-chain protocols

- Using in house price and security oracle and open-source governance from Compound

- This price oracle will be used to derive accounts and prices from custody accounts off-chain where the collateral is being held"
10976,2021-04-07 00:55:14+00:00,PaikCapital,"3. Participation of tradfi + defi

Onboarding tradfi corporations and regulated securities to take out defi loans and post collateral while allowing crypto brokers/dealers to interact on the defi platform.

Let's break this down."
10977,2021-04-07 00:55:14+00:00,PaikCapital,"2. Real-world collateral

BondAppetit uses debt securities (bonds) as collateral.

These bonds earn interest which are paid as fiat cash flow to governance token liquidity pools.

So by providing liquidity or holding $BAG you are rewarded in transaction fees + bond interest."
10978,2021-04-07 00:55:14+00:00,PaikCapital,"1. Main goal

""[BondApp√©tit] is the first-ever DeFi protocol that connects real-world debt instruments with the Ethereum ecosystem.""

Imagine a borrowing system backed by tradfi bonds with all the added bonuses of defi protocols used by both defi users and tradfi corporations."

No that's not what I said nor how it works.

Your deposit earns yield which goes to you.

11062,2021-04-03 17:20:51+00:00,PaikCapital,"10. Confirm and Swap!

So once you submit your fee, the transaction will be sent to validate!

You can also add the token on Metamask and see if the balance changed!

Ok this is the worst part of defi currently.

This is why L2 (layer-2 solutions exist).

The ETH network is slow and expensive.

To transact you have to pay fees.

It's the price you pay to access all of defi :)

Click ""edit"" for gas fee.

Click ""fast"" and save. https://t.co/Q2bBSwHhwS"
11064,2021-04-03 17:20:46+00:00,PaikCapital,"8d. Don't trust anything but official sources

Only trust a project's official tweets or website info.

Coingecko is pretty reliable as well."
11065,2021-04-03 17:20:46+00:00,PaikCapital,"8c. Token not found

If you type in the token but you can't see it on Uniswap, try this.

Click on the copy icon next to the contract on coingecko.

Paste into Uni! https://t.co/Bq2P8JpiqT"
11066,2021-04-03 17:20:43+00:00,PaikCapital,"8b. Liquidity

Two options:

1. Send eth from coinbase to ledger -&gt; connect to metamask

2. Create a metamask wallet -&gt; send eth from coinbase to metamask"

You can't take on more than a few clients before you need more manpower.

Hire a sales closer to take sales calls for you (15% commission).

Hire experts for service fulfillment (15% commission)."

$0

Every hot client you sign?
$2500/mo.

Long term goal?
10 clients

$25,000/mo - outreach costs.

The people who contact you on their own are the hottest leads ever."

Just like that you're in.

Only speak with only the decision makers.

Now if you want to learn a skill that business owners NEED and learn how to pitch it effectively to close clients, you need this.

Let me teach you everything from A to Z.
https://t.co/aRdG6vCQca"
13572,2020-12-04 16:23:31+00:00,PaikCapital,"6. Be confident and direct

Every thinks that to sound not like a salesperson you have to be very conversational and friendly.

That gets you nowhere.

Literally everyone tries to do that.

Act as if your Jake's buddy.

How would Jake's friend try to go through the receptionist?"
13573,2020-12-04 16:23:31+00:00,PaikCapital,"5. ""What is the purpose of the call?""

""I'm here to speak with Jake. It's Matt from Paik Capital. He should know what this call is about.""

At the very least, this gets the receptionist to go to the business owner and explain the call.

There's a good chance he picks up."
13574,2020-12-04 16:23:30+00:00,PaikCapital,"Redirecting the question is the best way to push through this objection.

The receptionist now has to answer your question, taking the focus away from her question.

It also shows that you aren't nervous about who you are which most sales people tend to be.

Confidence works."
13575,2020-12-04 16:23:30+00:00,PaikCapital,"4. The Art of Redirection

You lowered the chance of objections.

You might still get some.

Handle them like a boss.

""May I ask who's calling?

""Yes it's Matt from Paik Capital. Is Jake in right now?""

Flip the script.
Take control.
Redirect the question."
13576,2020-12-04 16:23:29+00:00,PaikCapital,"Why does the first one work?

In the receptionist's mind it shows that you have some sort of connection with the business owner.

Only strangers use full names when addressing people.

Secondly, being direct helps with urgency and also gets rid of the ""salesy"" type of vibe."
13577,2020-12-04 16:23:29+00:00,PaikCapital,"3. Respond with ONLY first names

""Hey Sarah, it's Matt. Can you put me through to Jake?""

Let's compare that to what a typical sales person would say:

""Hey Sarah, my name is Matthew Paik from Paik Capital. I was wondering if Jake Roberts was in the office?""

Not good."
13578,2020-12-04 16:23:28+00:00,PaikCapital,"2. The Opening

The opening is where the receptionist will introduce herself and the company.

""Hello this is XYZ company, it's Sarah speaking how may I help you?""

PERFECT.

Take note of her first name.

This is key."
13579,2020-12-04 16:23:27+00:00,PaikCapital,"1. Requirements

Only cold call a few times a day.

It's like sending cold emails.

You don't send 500 a day.

You send a few, hand-crafted ones.

Secondly, only call leads where you know their name.

Otherwise, it's 10x harder and not worth it.

Let's get started."
13580,2020-12-04 16:23:27+00:00,PaikCapital,"""Cold calling is a waste of time!""

WRONG.

It is the best way to conduct direct market research.

It is also an effective way to close sales if done correctly (not this thread).

Most of the time people get stuck speaking with a receptionist.

Let's change that."

Here's how to do it.

Train a few people to become sales closers and have them take all the calls.

Now you're just managing a sales team.

Save time, make more."

You want to be able to take on 2-4 hours of calls/day.

That's roughly 6-8 calls.

Closing at just 50% is 3-4 sales.

That's $1350 on the low end and $4200 on the high end.

Best part?

You're not in charge of the service fulfillment.

Just calls."

Focus on one type of closing
&gt;&gt; agency clients
&gt;&gt; coaching clients
&gt;&gt; consulting clients
&gt;&gt; B2B sales
&gt;&gt; etc.

You want to specialize.

They want an expert in that niche."

&gt;&gt; learning a skill
&gt;&gt; crafting an offer
&gt;&gt; outreach
&gt;&gt; sales
&gt;&gt; doing the work
&gt;&gt; automation

13772,2020-12-01 16:24:00+00:00,PaikCapital,"Well now at that point you have to also hire more sales closers and more freelancers to do more client work.

But YOU just have to manage now.

This is where the 10x happens.

You only have 8 hours in a day to work.

With 5 people you get 40 hours.

Do less, hire more, make more."
13773,2020-12-01 16:24:00+00:00,PaikCapital,"6. Scale with numbers

If you were doing outreach on your own before.

You could probably only send 30 personalized emails/day without going crazy.

Now you have someone else sending 30 a day.

What if you hired 2 people to do this?

3? 4? 5?

Now you can send up to 90-100/day."
13774,2020-12-01 16:23:59+00:00,PaikCapital,"5. What do you do?

You might think ok...what do I do then?

You manage.

You have to manage your team!

Daily quick meetings.

Biweekly longer ones.

Client communication.

*you can even hire someone for this!

Ok I might be saving a few hours a day...but how do I make 10x?"
13775,2020-12-01 16:23:57+00:00,PaikCapital,"What you're paying is $10-20/hr. to save you 2-3 hours every single day.

You're also giving up 30% of every client to save you another 2-3 hours every single day.

What you're left with is an extra 4-6 hours and 70% margins.

Worth it?

100%."
13776,2020-12-01 16:23:38+00:00,PaikCapital,"4.  Total costs

While this is a simplified process, let's just run some numbers.

You have a VA writing emails for you.
$5-10/hr.

You have a VA scheduling appointments.
$5-10/hr.

You have a sales closer.
15% commission.

You have a service provider.
15% commission."
13777,2020-12-01 16:23:38+00:00,PaikCapital,"3. Service Fulfillment

So now that you've found people to do all of your outreach and sales, all you have left is your service fulfillment.

Even this can be outsourced!

Find an expert for your service (any freelancing site)

Offer another 15% of every client they work on."
13778,2020-12-01 16:23:37+00:00,PaikCapital,"c. Taking phone calls

This one you cannot hire a VA.

You need a sales closer who is experienced.

Look around and ask around.

Offer 15% commission for every client they close.

Make sure they understand your service well.

Upwork is one place to look."
13779,2020-12-01 16:23:37+00:00,PaikCapital,"b. Schedule calls

This one is a bit simpler.

You just need a VA to read your emails daily and make sure to schedule and follow up with any meetings.

Hire a VA who can
&gt;&gt; speak English well
&gt;&gt; understand how to push for a meeting
&gt;&gt; work with your schedule"
13780,2020-12-01 16:23:35+00:00,PaikCapital,"a. Writing emails

Go to upwork or join a FB group with VAs inside.

Come up with a simple, short task to test their grammar, fluency, etc.

Ask 8-10 to do this test.

Hire the one you think has the most potential.

Train him by walking through previous examples."
13781,2020-12-01 16:23:34+00:00,PaikCapital,"2. Outsource smartly

Because these are high ROI tasks, you want to hire wisely.

Don't waste your time on a $2/hr. VA to write your emails if that's your main outreach channel.

What type of results do you expect?

Here's how I would hire for my high ROI tasks:"
13782,2020-12-01 16:23:34+00:00,PaikCapital,"For example let's say I run my agency.

Every day
&gt;&gt; I write emails
&gt;&gt; Schedule calls
&gt;&gt; Take phone calls
&gt;&gt; Talk with clients
&gt;&gt; Do my work for clients

Highest ROI?
&gt;&gt; Writing emails
&gt;&gt; Scheduling calls
&gt;&gt; Taking phone calls"
13783,2020-12-01 16:23:32+00:00,PaikCapital,"1. What is your REPEATABLE process?

You must have a repeatable way of running your biz.

It can be simply:
&gt;&gt; outreach
&gt;&gt; sales
&gt;&gt; service fulfillment

Now:
&gt;&gt; Break it down task by task
&gt;&gt; Which ones give you the HIGHEST ROI?
&gt;&gt; Those are the ones to focus on"

13982,2020-11-28 16:24:23+00:00,PaikCapital,"That's it.

You're probably thinking...

This is def something I can do.

Then take make it a reality.

Learn how to:
- choose your niche
- craft that offer
- find clients
- close them
- automate some work
- and a lot more...

Start your own agency!
https://t.co/aRdG6vCQca"
13983,2020-11-28 16:24:22+00:00,PaikCapital,"6. Close and get details

Tell your client you'll help create a 30 day timeline of how posts should be organized and created (including promos, etc.)

Close 10 clients for $1500/mo.

$15,000/mo.

Delegate the work to your VAs.

Focus on management and client communication."
13984,2020-11-28 16:24:22+00:00,PaikCapital,"Here's a quick tip:

When you're sending a message.

Say ""we have a few mockups up posts that we've recreated for you based on what we found on your XYZ social account if you would love to see them!""

If they respond...get to work.

This will save you wasted time."
13985,2020-11-28 16:24:21+00:00,PaikCapital,"5. Outreach like crazy

I've listed many types of outreach in prev tweets
&gt;&gt; twitter DM
&gt;&gt; IG video DM
&gt;&gt; FB messenger
&gt;&gt; linkedin message
&gt;&gt; cold email
&gt;&gt; paid ads

Choose one and work with it"
13986,2020-11-28 16:24:21+00:00,PaikCapital,"You need to nail down your offer by understanding WHY content creation helps businesses grow and increase brand awareness.

Without understanding this for your niche you choose you won't have effective outreach.

Remember outreach is only as powerful as your offer."
13987,2020-11-28 16:24:20+00:00,PaikCapital,"4. Define your service

So by now you realize you're going to pitch content creation to businesses.

How many posts a day will you be able to provide for brands?

What type of brands do you want to work with?

Why is content creation important and how does it affect direct ROI?"
13988,2020-11-28 16:24:20+00:00,PaikCapital,"The test:

Give them a few sample brand accounts.

Have them recreate 3-6 posts each.

See how they do.

They won't be perfect, but they can always improve based on your feedback.

Hire 2-3 that you like.

There's your content creation team."
13989,2020-11-28 16:24:19+00:00,PaikCapital,"3. Hire VAs

Plenty of sites to do so from
I like Upwork

&gt;&gt; Find content designers VAs
&gt;&gt; Filter for $5-10/hr
&gt;&gt; Get them all on a video call with you
&gt;&gt; Explain your repeatable process of content creation
&gt;&gt; Send your swipe file to them
&gt;&gt; Give them a test (read next)"
13990,2020-11-28 16:24:18+00:00,PaikCapital,"You won't make good content initially.

Unless you're a designer.

Then you probably don't need to practice much.

Focus on a theme and style.

Simplify the process.

MAKE IT REPEATABLE.

This is important."
13991,2020-11-28 16:24:18+00:00,PaikCapital,"2. Practice. Practice. Practice.

&gt;&gt; Find a small brand on IG
&gt;&gt; Screenshot a row of their posts
&gt;&gt; Go to Canva
&gt;&gt; Recreate the images to make them BETTER
&gt;&gt; Use your swipe file as inspiration
&gt;&gt; Do this over and over with diff posts
&gt;&gt; Keep the styles consistent"
13992,2020-11-28 16:24:17+00:00,PaikCapital,"This part is about creating a swipe file of posts and grids that work well.

Saving these screenshots into a folder is what is called a ""swipe file"".

Build this up for ideas and inspirations later on.

Let's move on."
13993,2020-11-28 16:24:17+00:00,PaikCapital,"1.  Find some awesome brand and theme accounts on IG

&gt;&gt; Go to Google
&gt;&gt; ""Best IG theme pages""
&gt;&gt; Look through plenty of examples
&gt;&gt; Screenshot grids that stand out

14138,2020-11-25 16:24:45+00:00,PaikCapital,"DMs are powerful.

But take this one step further and CREATE an agency to do even more outreach.

Learn/ outsource a $1500-4000 skill.
Learn how to find paying clients for it.
Learn to close them.

You can get the whole entire process from A to Z here:
https://t.co/aRdG6vCQca"
14139,2020-11-25 16:24:45+00:00,PaikCapital,"Now let's do some math.

Reach out to 20 people a day.

Let's say you have just a 5% conversion rate.

That means you get 1 customer a day.

Seem small?

What happens if your offer is coaching or 1-1 training?

$500-1500?

Think big.

Your DMs just became worth $1000s."
14140,2020-11-25 16:24:44+00:00,PaikCapital,"6. Close and get details

Once you close them, make sure to get paid right away.

Set up a paypal or stripe invoice or get paid instantly through Venmo or Zelle.

Then collect the necessary info and get to work."
14141,2020-11-25 16:24:44+00:00,PaikCapital,"5. Responding

Ok you got a response.

If it's for a deliverable, ask the freelancer you found for a quick mockup to show the user.

If it's consulting, answer all questions and ask to get on the phone to clarify even more.

You're 80% there at this point."
14142,2020-11-25 16:24:43+00:00,PaikCapital,"For a deliverable: 
Add ""I have a few designs made for you to look at!""

For a service you provide (consulting):
Add ""Let me know if you want to ask me anything about this!""

Then wait for a response."
14143,2020-11-25 16:24:43+00:00,PaikCapital,"4. DM structure

First off, do not send 18 sentences. People think that sending a longer DM will get you noticed.

Not true.

Open up with a quick compliment but get to the point.

This next part differs whether you are offering a deliverable or consulting."
14144,2020-11-25 16:24:42+00:00,PaikCapital,"3. Effective DM outreach

You have 3 ways to do this on Twitter.
&gt;&gt; Categories
&gt;&gt; Hashtags
&gt;&gt; Comments from posts

Find people who look RELEVANT to DM.

The worst thing you can do is DM someone who is not going to be interested, ever."
14145,2020-11-25 16:24:41+00:00,PaikCapital,"2. Determine your pricing

If. you have your own skill/service price your time accordingly:
$$$ = 1-1 coaching
$$ = basic consulting
$ = hard deliverable

If you're using fiverr:
2-3x the price the fiverr seller is asking for.
Ask if you can help get them clients through you."
14146,2020-11-25 16:24:40+00:00,PaikCapital,"I mention fiverr but you really just need some outsourcing platform to be able to provide a skill.

This can be even SEO, web dev, professional design needs, etc.

Best if you can see a portfolio from the freelancer and understand exactly the process from the sale to delivery."
14147,2020-11-25 16:24:40+00:00,PaikCapital,"1. Choose a skill/service to provide

If you have your own PERFECT.
&gt;&gt; consulting
&gt;&gt; coaching
&gt;&gt; design work
&gt;&gt; etc.

If not, do this
&gt;&gt; go to fiverr
&gt;&gt; find a skill with a clear deliverable
&gt;&gt; talk to freelancers
&gt;&gt; see if they can do a trial/mockup of their service"

At this point you'll have:
&gt;&gt; launching an agency from ZERO
&gt;&gt; learning how to get clients
&gt;&gt; learning FB ads as a skill
&gt;&gt; learning copywriting as a skill

You need this. Check it out

14426,2020-11-20 16:22:32+00:00,PaikCapital,"Direct response copywriting is needed in every industry and business.

It's used for ads, blogs, landing pages, funnels, and so much more.

If you want to learn more and be able to start writing compelling copy, it's going to take months.

Not weeks.

But there is good news:"
14427,2020-11-20 16:22:32+00:00,PaikCapital,"1. Think of the end goal action

2. Write down my initial thoughts (even if it's wordy, long, and terrible)

3. Cut it down / make it concise

4. Add in appropriate adverbs and adjectives that add the emotional effect to it

5. Read it over out loud 10x

6. Repeat again and again"
14428,2020-11-20 16:22:31+00:00,PaikCapital,"Tip 3: Practice every day

&gt;&gt; Go on Facebook or google
&gt;&gt; Find article headlines
&gt;&gt; Find ad headlines

&gt;&gt; Write them down
&gt;&gt; Now write your version next to it

Do this every day.
Here's the steps I take when I write copy:"
14429,2020-11-20 16:22:31+00:00,PaikCapital,"Tip 2: Realize the emotion

Excellent copywriting plays off of your emotions.

Power words, trigger words, etc.

""Alarming""
""Shocking""
""Unexpected""

These will have you locked in to that sentence, forcing you to read the rest.

Understand this.
Take it in."
14430,2020-11-20 16:22:30+00:00,PaikCapital,"Tip 1: Study excellent copywriting

How do you find ""good"" copywriting?

&gt;&gt; What ads did you click on recently
&gt;&gt; What videos did you watch
&gt;&gt; What articles stood out

Study the headlines. 
Study the first line in any body of text.

If it drove YOU to action, it's good."

Craft your copy according to how much the audience knows about how similar solutions/products can satisfy their desires.

Not features."

Fear

Desire
""Get rid of my constant back pain""

Curiosity
""Would monthly visits really help?""

""This seems like it's going to take some time""

Indeed it will.

In the beginning, you trade your time for clients, results, and testimonials.

14766,2020-11-15 16:32:21+00:00,PaikCapital,"Why do both of these work?

No business owner wants to do their own marketing.

The want to focus on their craft.

Providing value positions you as an expert, not a salesman.

Give so much value you gain their trust.

That's when they'll start to contact you directly."

14886,2020-11-14 16:28:57+00:00,PaikCapital,"TIP #3: Produce &gt; Consume

It's 100% easier to consume than produce.

Sit down with a paper and pencil.
Write out your idea
Figure out the fastest way to get things working.
Then get to work.

The moment you begin to produce &gt; consume your life gets 10x better."
14887,2020-11-14 16:28:56+00:00,PaikCapital,"TIP #2: Provide insane value

Don't post memes, argue with anon accounts, and retweet sports highlights

and then wonder why you can't sell your $15 ebook about making money.

Your account is your high value content funnel.

Provide insight.

Become the expert.

Raise the stakes."

Pray. Think. Meditate.

If you can't handle being alone with your thoughts then do this more often.

Clear your mind = clarity.

Think deeply = vision.

You will have laser focus and direction.

Ok, so now you've gotten 8-10 sales.

Took a lot of work and probably a few weeks to hammer through.

Now, streamline the communication between clients and contractors.

Then hire someone to manage the whole workflow.

Boom."
17268,2020-08-28 16:09:25+00:00,PaikCapital,"5. Get clients

Use every social media platform.

Go to business pages, check out their designs, and create mockups for them.

They'll be interested.

Give them your pitch.

Too much work?

Run Facebook ads.

17270,2020-08-28 16:09:23+00:00,PaikCapital,"3. Create your offers

Talk with your small network and get their prices.

Now double or triple that price and that's the price you'll charge clients.

So if your contractors want $30/logo charge $90-100.

You keep the $60-70 difference.

Nice margins :)"

Ask for their portfolios and samples.

17272,2020-08-28 16:09:22+00:00,PaikCapital,"2. Build a small network

Ask if they want to join as contractors for you.

Don't have any?

Go to Fiverr.

Find 10-20 ppl who can do your service.

Message all of them with a business proposal."

If you‚Äôre slowly increasing in value with the 90% investments, it can completely cover the 10% loss if you were to lose it all.

With investing your value is dictated by time.
