Since wicking down to the $3000s (again due to liquidations forcing price lower than fair value), we've rocketed back to $10k. Once again we are taking a breather, catching our breath.

1380,2020-10-25 00:29:55+00:00,AlexSaundersAU,"3/ You must identify &amp; align the cycles yourself.

On my chart the green cycles are roughly four years long. Although Bitcoin's halving is also every four years, the cycles do not align with halving dates. We find the halving tends to get front run &amp; excitement builds beforehand,"

A bit like ripple giving out XRP &amp; selling at discount. The subsidies have a algorithmic release schedule. Then token holders end up owning a piece of the platform. Like if xrp airdrops gave governance rights
3107,2020-07-12 22:53:28+00:00,AlexSaundersAU,@HamEggsnSam No. Valid use cases are based around demand for trading &amp; derivative products  ie I may borrow at 12% APY to put on a decentralised leverage trade. I dont mind paying 1% for 1 month. If that's makes sense. Check out @dydxprotocol or @DDX_Official
3108,2020-07-12 22:42:37+00:00,AlexSaundersAU,@HamEggsnSam People aren't paying 20-30% to borrow. People are getting 20-30% to lend. In some cases people are actually also being paid to borrow. The difference is being subsidized by bootstrapping token drops.

5878,2019-11-02 00:26:10+00:00,AlexSaundersAU,@CredibleCrypto Yes but each buy is a sell so total demand for XRP doesn't really change. This could also be done with already without XRP in the middle using USDC &amp; a mexico pegged stable coin &amp; just swapping them on a DEX.

6067,2019-10-15 06:08:20+00:00,AlexSaundersAU,"@phenrikand @danielalexiuc Ok, but in theory if was block was mined EXACTLY every 10 minutes on the dot then poisson process would not apply &amp; avg wait time would be 5 minutes."
6068,2019-10-15 06:03:06+00:00,AlexSaundersAU,@phenrikand @danielalexiuc How can you frequently wait longer than 10mins if the mempool is empty &amp; a block is mined exactly every 10 mins in my perfect world example?
6069,2019-10-15 05:58:08+00:00,AlexSaundersAU,@danielalexiuc @phenrikand Ok that's make sense. But my assumption was correct that in a perfect world if a block was mined exactly every 10mins &amp; the mempool was empty. Then the avg wait time would be 5mins. Because no one is ever waiting longer than 10mins?
6070,2019-10-15 04:53:23+00:00,AlexSaundersAU,@phenrikand Isn't the case* as you can see above
6071,2019-10-15 04:52:32+00:00,AlexSaundersAU,"@phenrikand Yes but that's different to the avg wait time for each individual Tx if the mempool is being emptied, which is the average of the distribution of Tx spread evenly over the 10 min intervals. Saying ever Tx waits 10min on avg. https://t.co/KnBi3cENKa"

As the empty mempool fills up, Tx flow in, no Tx waits longer than 10min &amp; no faster than 0min (mempool empty), with an even distribution over that 10min, avg wait is 5min."
