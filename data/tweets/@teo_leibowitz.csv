244,2022-11-01 19:29:49+00:00,teo_leibowitz,"6/ 

For simplicity, we used the price of the pool at future times as the reference price. This will undercount future price by ignoring price impact and fees paid to LPs, but it is an improvement."
245,2022-11-01 19:29:49+00:00,teo_leibowitz,"5/ 

Lastly, this query includes the fee given to the LPs as part of the exchange rate. We adjust for this to find the correct execution price."
246,2022-11-01 19:29:48+00:00,teo_leibowitz,"4/ 

Another issue with this query is that it doesn’t factor price impact into the execution price—instead, it only takes the mid-price at the time the trade was executed. 

Price impact is good for LPs because it means they are selling fewer assets at less favorable prices."
247,2022-11-01 19:29:48+00:00,teo_leibowitz,"3/ 

So what’s wrong with this query? 

For one, it doesn’t account for LP fees! When we factor in LP fees, we find that ETH/USDC LPs have generated 2.5x more fees for LPs than the value lost via markout. 

https://t.co/JlSDVlRGmv https://t.co/Q953n6nP3E"
248,2022-11-01 19:29:47+00:00,teo_leibowitz,"2/ 

First, what is ‘markout’? 

In this instance, markout is defined as the difference between the execution price versus the price 24 hours later. 

The logic in this chart is that LPs lose money when they sell an asset that appreciates or buy an asset that depreciates."
249,2022-11-01 19:29:46+00:00,teo_leibowitz,"1/ 

Lots of chart crime on CT recently but this query takes the biscuit (cookie for my US readers) 

TLDR: The Uniswap v3 ETH/USDC 30 bps pool has generated 2.5x more fees for LPs than the ‘24 hr markout’.

2655,2019-07-24 17:32:17+00:00,teo_leibowitz,"@RyanSAdams agree token value vs. tx fee are very different - my point is that, of the two, tx fee is far better for FV analysis. 

yah hard to compare across some chains with weird tx fee structure but works for the most part"
2656,2019-07-24 17:30:45+00:00,teo_leibowitz,"@RyanSAdams don't think NVTV is right way to measure security 

security = miner rev not NV so you're always going to see NV of base layer + supported tokens as a multiple of miner revenue (aka the Security Factor) 

once you have that the important question is then 'what SF is sufficient?'"
2657,2019-07-24 17:16:14+00:00,teo_leibowitz,"@RyanSAdams ultimately they're both aiming to fundamentally value networks using some kind of data as a proxy for demand. 

NVTV uses aggregate token NV as proxy, NVAFR uses transaction fees as proxy. latter is superior as there is no multiplier at play"
2658,2019-07-24 17:06:27+00:00,teo_leibowitz,"@RyanSAdams NVAFR is better and more directly analogous to P/S 

NVTV relies too heavily on NVs, which are highly tenuous in illiquid markets
