4,2023-02-13 17:52:33+00:00,lawmaster,"@iamDCinvestor Because it made them a shit ton of money. USDP is effectively failing against competition and BUSD made Paxos competitive because of Binance incentives.

6,2023-02-13 08:58:47+00:00,lawmaster,@Tree_of_Alpha Don‚Äôt think this would make it a security but there is 50-50 revenue split between Paxos and Binance. Rev share in general probably is enough for Garry to overstep his jurisdiction
7,2023-02-13 08:11:31+00:00,lawmaster,@XBTChris @Tree_of_Alpha Yea probably around $300M/yr. And great rev generation for bears. Maybe they make a similar deal with Tether now
8,2023-02-13 08:07:50+00:00,lawmaster,@Tree_of_Alpha Wonder what this means for their stable strategy. Likely will have to go back to USDT in terms of incentives or something
9,2023-02-13 08:05:53+00:00,lawmaster,@cryptolamps @DegenSpartan Ofc it won't affect redemptions. But just the fact that it can't be issued anymore means that all the incentives etc. have to stop because no more BUSD can be created it sounds like
10,2023-02-13 08:03:33+00:00,lawmaster,@DegenSpartan Wonder if this means they also have to redeem the $16B+ already out there or just stop issuance. Pretty sure Binance is making $300M+ from rev share on that alone. And incentivizing the fuck out of the usage

126,2022-11-25 12:44:52+00:00,lawmaster,@ASvanevik @nansen_intern Damn you guys are actually going to make me do this research. Fuck
127,2022-11-25 12:35:22+00:00,lawmaster,"@ASvanevik @nansen_intern Hm yea I think you're right after some research. Looks like:

Binance - 7,500
Coinbase - 5,000
OKX - 3,800
CDC - 3,500
Huobi - 1,500

Where does the other 30k come from, though? These should be by far the largest"
128,2022-11-25 12:23:59+00:00,lawmaster,@ASvanevik @nansen_intern 50k for exchanges sounds a bit too high to me. Probably closer to 20k if I were to guess

131,2022-11-25 11:04:32+00:00,lawmaster,@Etherdox @poordart Yea that was just explaining the price increase at the time. LUNA collapse was something I was talking about a lot privately and was just a matter of time in my head. Didn't expect it as soon as it happened but was always something I saw coming
132,2022-11-25 11:03:09+00:00,lawmaster,@JaEsf @poordart Yea exactly the same
133,2022-11-25 11:02:39+00:00,lawmaster,@poordart Like I felt so confident that everything was ok that I purposely didn't withdraw money despite knowing it's fucking retarded to not do it even if 1% chance. Very costly mistake in the end
134,2022-11-25 10:59:02+00:00,lawmaster,@maxboonen @Tree_of_Alpha Would definitely read it
135,2022-11-25 10:58:20+00:00,lawmaster,"@poordart Yea I mean show me a single person that thought the chance of FTX full-on collapse and insolvency was more than like 5%. People now in hindsight find so many things (low float shit, no CFO, scammy projects, etc.) but in reality, no one had any clue this could happen."
136,2022-11-25 10:54:53+00:00,lawmaster,@poordart LMFAO. LUNA I actually was quite bearish on but yea 3AC and FTX completely mind fucked me. If Binance collapse soon I'm probably just gonna go do something else
137,2022-11-25 10:51:01+00:00,lawmaster,"@maxboonen @Tree_of_Alpha Wouldn't it make more sense for exchanges like Binance to periodically withdraw revenue/profit to separate wallets? But maybe that would give away too much about their financial performance, hard to say"
138,2022-11-25 10:09:42+00:00,lawmaster,@nansen_intern Oof this research took like almost a month. Will look into it though

140,2022-11-25 09:48:12+00:00,lawmaster,@0xGoogly @Tree_of_Alpha Occam's razor is they store its own profits in the same cold wallet as some customer funds. Would think they should change that but likely all exchanges do it that way too
141,2022-11-25 09:08:58+00:00,lawmaster,"@Tree_of_Alpha Both options not fantastic tbh

This was the funding transaction: https://t.co/IqqxIaNlNR"
142,2022-11-25 09:08:19+00:00,lawmaster,"@Tree_of_Alpha Yea so I'm looking into it more. Binance funded 1B BUSD from their cold wallet (0xf977), which was disclosed in their list of wallets last week. So basically either:

- using their own profits but why same wallet as customer deposits
 - using customer funds, which I doubt is true"

148,2022-11-25 07:46:18+00:00,lawmaster,@mayazi @DegenSpartan Yea and you think they'd do the same thing after two weeks? LMAO
149,2022-11-25 07:45:46+00:00,lawmaster,@DegenSpartan What is a big weird is that it's from one of the proof of reserves wallets but that's probably just because they keep profit and customer deposits in the same wallets. Should likely change that tbh
150,2022-11-25 07:44:03+00:00,lawmaster,"@DegenSpartan Binance is insanely profitable. 100% made a few billion in profit during the last bull market. They would have to be completely fucking retarded to use customer funds, it makes no sense"

239,2022-11-15 20:43:41+00:00,lawmaster,@ChrisBlec @iamDCinvestor @matthuang Weren't all investors on the board?
240,2022-11-15 20:16:18+00:00,lawmaster,"@CupOJoseph @iamDCinvestor @matthuang That's not enough. Even if you knew all addresses (which I knew), you wouldn't know how much is supposed to be there. And you wouldn't be able to check on liabilities. So overall it's basically useless"
241,2022-11-15 20:04:08+00:00,lawmaster,"@iamDCinvestor @matthuang Being on the Board probably does move the standard a bit, you‚Äôre right about that. Overall would be very difficult to get a proper list of liabilities though but I get your point"

265,2022-11-14 20:56:40+00:00,lawmaster,@harrycanuck @evan_van_ness @VitalikButerin Could be a family member but very unlikely it's OTC desk based on what I know. Just odd overall

267,2022-11-14 20:52:03+00:00,lawmaster,@evan_van_ness @VitalikButerin I would be very surprised if this is not him... The wallet received 12k ETH in 17 separate transactions from VB's doxx'd address (0x1db) and also sent 600 ETH to the same addy in 6 tx's. Then received another 600 ETH and sent 3.7k ETH to another VB's address (0x0cfb).

362,2022-11-10 12:20:29+00:00,lawmaster,@HsakaTrades Post LUNA crash Tether grazed 90c for a bit and then got arbed hard within a couple of hours. But people are now even more spooked now than before so should be fun. Especially since it was usually Alameda doing the fastest and largest arbs

898,2022-06-20 03:51:18+00:00,lawmaster,@otteroooo @loomdart @fintechfrank I‚Äôve been saying myself BlockFi is facing issues way before your thread or even before 3AC and Celsius situations. My point is that it doesn‚Äôt really matter if there are issues or not because game theory says everyone should withdraw asap whether it‚Äôs BlockFi or any other service
899,2022-06-20 03:48:09+00:00,lawmaster,@FreddieRaynolds @fintechfrank In theory yes but in practice it‚Äôs somewhat possible they generated significantly more in bull than they needed for yield and can ride it out for a limited time in bear with not much exposure. I think a much larger issue is illiquidity and complete panic
900,2022-06-20 03:40:19+00:00,lawmaster,"@CryptoUniversa2 @fintechfrank No, speaking specifically about retail oriented yield platforms, not exchanges"
901,2022-06-20 03:39:42+00:00,lawmaster,"@fintechfrank A lot of these platforms are designed to opaquely generate really high yield, which works in bull markets but not so much in this environment. And now they can‚Äôt really liquidate long term obligations and people would have to be dumb to want to be exposed to illiquidity risk now"
902,2022-06-20 03:37:16+00:00,lawmaster,@fintechfrank My guess is almost nothing in the grand scheme of things. The problem now is that everyone and their mom is spreading rumors about every single lending/yield platform and therefore it‚Äôs a losing game to leave money there IMO.

905,2022-06-19 16:10:21+00:00,lawmaster,@svrnco @luigidemeo @solendprotocol Yea and another problem is that Solana still has an enormous spam issue that‚Äôs making the situation even more difficult
906,2022-06-19 16:05:17+00:00,lawmaster,@luigidemeo @solendprotocol They clearly have the OTC sale lined up here and it must be Alabama.

1122,2022-05-30 13:26:37+00:00,lawmaster,@richwgalvin @hasufl Because there is unnecessary sell pressure to fund operations and also token distribution is getting absolutely rekt. Who‚Äôs even left holding UNI tokens (outside of locked up employees and VCs) after roundtripping from $5 to $40 and back.
1123,2022-05-30 13:01:37+00:00,lawmaster,@richwgalvin @hasufl I use Uniswap almost every day and have no need or desire to hold the token. That's a problem
1124,2022-05-30 12:56:57+00:00,lawmaster,@richwgalvin @hasufl Dividends don't matter at all. What matters is building a self-sustainable protocol that doesn't rely on treasury in UNI which only further increases sell pressure. Where is the VC arm even financed from? Nothing needs to be distributed for the first X years
1125,2022-05-30 12:55:02+00:00,lawmaster,@richwgalvin @Fiskantes @hasufl Do you really think that fee switch would affect liquidity enough to have an impact on Uniswap being a long-term winner? Who exactly is even competing right now?

1128,2022-05-30 12:47:49+00:00,lawmaster,"@richwgalvin @hasufl Why not just have a fee switch on without any distribution and holders decide on how it's spent (or whether it's distributed or not). Right now, the protocol is generating 0 revenue outside of LPs, which isn't really comparable to early-stage startups IMO"
1129,2022-05-30 12:44:54+00:00,lawmaster,"@JaEsf @hasufl I agree. Will push founders to actually not just do the meme ""valueless governance"" stuff.

1130,2022-05-30 12:42:38+00:00,lawmaster,"@mjpldn @mayazi @hasufl There are still ways you can fix it IMO. Move the team to the Bahamas/Panama/wherever, incorporate the foundation there and then turn on the fee switch and lead the way in the ""productive"" token narrative"
1131,2022-05-30 12:40:40+00:00,lawmaster,"@mayazi @hasufl Unless you are scared of regulators, I don't understand what you're waiting for in terms of the fee switch. The main argument used to be let's get as many customers as possible before even considering. There is effectively no competition now, brand recognition is enormous etc."
1132,2022-05-30 12:34:44+00:00,lawmaster,@hasufl I don't think people appreciate how insane it was when Uniswap reached $40bn+ FDV. Like that's almost three times Coinbase's mcap right now. With very unclear long term fee moat
1133,2022-05-30 12:25:44+00:00,lawmaster,@hasufl my guess is low confidnce in the fee being turned on anytime soon combined with them hyping up v3 so much it created the top on the release. faith in governance basically 0

2030,2022-02-06 08:49:47+00:00,lawmaster,"@pencilforge @loomdart Some are, some aren‚Äôt. Literally everything in the world works that way. Standardizing digital in-game assets would only help open shit up"

2032,2022-02-06 08:38:39+00:00,lawmaster,"@austerity_sucks If their DAO actually functions as a proper DAO, they can simply vote him out if they have enough support.

2062,2022-02-01 16:47:19+00:00,lawmaster,@matthuang And then you don't necessarily want to see Alameda and Jump being 90% of the capital on the L1 either. So some decent distribution is super important IMO too
2063,2022-02-01 16:46:48+00:00,lawmaster,"@matthuang Unfortunately, there is not a single easy metric I think. I tend to watch how much capital is interacting with the blue-chip protocols on each L1. Not necessarily focusing on the quick farms but on the basic verticals (lending, DEXs, derivatives, structure products, etc.)"
2064,2022-02-01 16:36:26+00:00,lawmaster,"@matthuang On top of that, how sticky the capital actually is. If everyone flocks from BSC to Fantom and then somewhere else once the incentives are depleted, that's not necessarily a meaningful proxy of success either."
2065,2022-02-01 16:35:08+00:00,lawmaster,@matthuang What I like to watch the most is how much capital is actually being used on the protocol. Not necessarily TVL since that's a flawed metric but how much money (and how distributed) trusts the L1 enough to use it for financial use cases. I find that everything else can be gamed

2520,2021-12-01 17:02:29+00:00,lawmaster,I have a bet going on this. Wonder what people think right now
2521,2021-12-01 17:02:09+00:00,lawmaster,"BTC stays below the all-time high for 2 years, including at least one drop of 60% or more from ATH during this period, this is a bear market. Must happen by 5-Nov-2025 or the ‚Äòno bear market‚Äô side wins."
2522,2021-12-01 11:37:09+00:00,lawmaster,@Lubow2 @0xShual @mrjasonchoi @Daryllautk Interesting. That could work
2523,2021-12-01 11:36:24+00:00,lawmaster,@Daryllautk @0xShual @Lubow2 @mrjasonchoi By show up you just mean time availability and following up on promises in the raise?
2524,2021-12-01 11:33:44+00:00,lawmaster,@0xShual @Lubow2 @mrjasonchoi @Daryllautk That's the problem. You can't get into nuance in a survey if each project has ~10 VCs on cap table. No one will do the survey if it takes 30+ minutes and especially not in crypto
2525,2021-12-01 11:30:21+00:00,lawmaster,"@Lubow2 @0xShual @mrjasonchoi @Daryllautk So maybe two-question anonymous survey:

1. Which VCs are on your cap table?
2. Rate them from most to least helpful

I assume that would be enough to get some good results if the sample size is 200+"
2526,2021-12-01 11:26:42+00:00,lawmaster,@0xShual @mrjasonchoi @Daryllautk I'm down to actually do this but how would you structure a survey like this?
2527,2021-12-01 11:06:37+00:00,lawmaster,@Arthur_0x @TheBlockRes @MessariCrypto Curious what your definition would be. If you were to generalize
2528,2021-12-01 11:04:29+00:00,lawmaster,@Arthur_0x @TheBlockRes @MessariCrypto Or would the intention be to simply remove all the obvious garbage VCs so normie founders don‚Äôt fall into the obvious traps? And just focus on some arbitrary standard of what a ‚Äúlegit‚Äù crypto VC firm looks like
2529,2021-12-01 10:58:31+00:00,lawmaster,@Arthur_0x @TheBlockRes @MessariCrypto That‚Äôs easy to say but imagine if as a result of limiting sample size DeFiance doesn‚Äôt come out looking so good and then you can‚Äôt even do anything since we couldn‚Äôt disclose the projects that didn‚Äôt have a great experience. Feels like there would be a lot of disagreement
2530,2021-12-01 10:53:41+00:00,lawmaster,"@Arthur_0x @TheBlockRes @MessariCrypto I can also see one project finding a specific VC firm completely useless and another one finding them helpful based on what they actually need the most. Some are good shills, some help with hiring, feedback, some even with in-house code review. It‚Äôs hard determine what matters"
2531,2021-12-01 10:51:56+00:00,lawmaster,@Arthur_0x @TheBlockRes @MessariCrypto Defining what ‚Äúlegit‚Äù means is difficult. What we could theoretically do is survey founders of the more successful protocols and ask them to rate their own investors anonymously. The issue is getting a sufficient sample size and then having meaningful results.

2539,2021-11-29 11:11:34+00:00,lawmaster,@mewn21 The most bullish thing is that there are now relatively uncorrelated crypto subsectors that have had their own downturns and mini bull markets. Possible that would all go to shit if BTC tanks for 1y+ but very different from 2017

2662,2021-11-15 17:42:32+00:00,lawmaster,@ceterispar1bus Yea I would be shocked if 100k real users ever used Uniswap. It‚Äôs pretty depressing
2663,2021-11-15 15:36:03+00:00,lawmaster,@Crypto_McKenna @Fiskantes @proofofhumanity I think that's a terrible look. But don't think they have much of an option as a doxx'd team and now there is 1inch's precedence
2664,2021-11-15 15:28:39+00:00,lawmaster,@Fiskantes @Crypto_McKenna Exactly. Depends on what you are optimizing for. I personally think the ideal airdrop is slightly more than 100k users and 15-20% of the supply but different projects have different goals with what they want to get out of it
2665,2021-11-15 15:07:13+00:00,lawmaster,"@CryptoCato3 Yes, their methodology is too aggressive. Very effective but I would make it much less restrictive. IMO targeting an airdrop to ~100k users is optimal, they only did 20k"
2666,2021-11-15 14:19:56+00:00,lawmaster,@edwardmorra_btc Check again
2667,2021-11-15 14:18:40+00:00,lawmaster,"@CryptoCato3 It very much depends on what are you optimizing for. Airdrops can optimize for acquiring new users, marketing, press, etc. In general, you don't really want to distribute an airdrop to users who sybiled but you also don't want a high false-negative rate."
2668,2021-11-15 13:53:39+00:00,lawmaster,@BlainePattavina I don't agree with that part but the sybil resistance is super well thought out
2669,2021-11-15 13:51:04+00:00,lawmaster,This is actually a really sophisticated mechanism https://t.co/LJVvGXeKtd
2670,2021-11-15 13:48:25+00:00,lawmaster,"All those angry people in my replies are getting the airdrop now and should be grateful that a lot of sybil was removed. The wider the distribution, the less value you are capturing. Most airdrops were 100k+ addresses and this one is 20k"
2671,2021-11-15 13:44:31+00:00,lawmaster,@0xshroom @matchaxyz You realize you just made a shit ton more because fake sybil users were removed? Large distribution airdrops dilute real users like you so much

2673,2021-11-15 13:37:44+00:00,lawmaster,"@icebergy_ Generally, the constraint is the available supply. Most super successful airdrops were to 100k+ addresses. Not even sure if 1inch has that much in treasury to give enough to every user (has to be more than $300 to be worth claiming)"

2675,2021-11-15 13:32:54+00:00,lawmaster,@mskvsk Yea I mean it's a hard balance. I'd say the chance that someone who only used your service is sybiling is pretty high. Not 100% but close.

2682,2021-11-15 12:39:12+00:00,lawmaster,"The ugly truth is that as long as you have rules that are super easy to figure out, the airdrop might be good for marketing but it will get the tokens to the hands of people who didn't deserve it. Once you get burnt $50k+ on gas, you're not gonna keep doing it again and again"
2683,2021-11-15 12:37:46+00:00,lawmaster,"The proper way to stop assholes like me from sybil farming airdrops is to do exactly what Paraswap just did. You create arbitrary conditions in how you classify ""active users"" to remove as much as you can to make it just enough economically unfeasible to try to do it again"

2892,2021-10-19 18:24:19+00:00,lawmaster,@andy8052 @NTmoney @HopProtocol What I think could be a good metric is removing all wallets that have historically had less than 10 transactions. Basically only starting to count a wallet as a user after they hit a certain number of transactions overall. Would remove a lot of obvious sybil airdroppers

3075,2021-09-27 08:24:57+00:00,lawmaster,@Fin4Dao @bantg I agree. DeFi teams should not be based in the U.S. in the first place and eventually likely be anon altogether

3078,2021-09-27 07:04:47+00:00,lawmaster,@poordart @mewn21 They will hopefully change that when they ‚Äúfully decentralize‚Äù in the next year and this is all just regulatory psyops. Otherwise makes 0 sense

3080,2021-09-27 06:50:16+00:00,lawmaster,@MonetSupply @ConvexMonster @DegenSpartan Yea personally I think this approach is complete trash. And I won‚Äôt ever support a token that openly says there is no claim ever for tokenholders
3081,2021-09-27 06:47:36+00:00,lawmaster,@statelayer @ConvexMonster @DegenSpartan Well it tries to disconnect itself as much as possible from being considered a security from a fee/revenue perspective. But it‚Äôs clearly not as decentralized as Uniswap
3082,2021-09-27 06:03:04+00:00,lawmaster,@ConvexMonster @DegenSpartan It takes an incredibly cautious approach yes
3083,2021-09-27 05:53:26+00:00,lawmaster,@DegenSpartan Yea in reality this token design is much much worse than Uniswap. Most of UNI investors price in rev share happening at some point whereas it‚Äôs off limits for DYDX.
3084,2021-09-27 05:22:55+00:00,lawmaster,@DegenSpartan The float is super tiny so short term it can pump but long term will be difficult as a lot of supply enters circulation. Will depend on the traction

3088,2021-09-26 13:44:38+00:00,lawmaster,@sassal0x @cyounessi1 Well that's my point then. It's fine not being decentralized as much as Ethereum for certain usecases. That's literally my entire point
3089,2021-09-26 13:42:55+00:00,lawmaster,@sassal0x @cyounessi1 And you think that Matic is decentralized enough to resist nation states?
3090,2021-09-26 13:41:53+00:00,lawmaster,@cyounessi1 A nation state can very likely take down Matic if they want and there are ETH people supporting it as a solution. Ethereum is by far the most decentralized and therefore the most secure but can't currently support all applications so people turn elsewhere
3091,2021-09-26 13:35:58+00:00,lawmaster,@cyounessi1 I don't disagree that we should be building for maximal decentralization. But the boundaries of what's decentralized enough haven't been tested yet. Most regular people don't care as long as no one can prevent them from using it. It's a spectrum IMO
3092,2021-09-26 13:26:51+00:00,lawmaster,@cyounessi1 The main question that I don‚Äôt think anyone knows an answer to is how much decentralization is enough. Something like Matic isn‚Äôt decentralized either even compared to some of the more centralized L1s. We will likely find out in the next few years though

3203,2021-09-13 05:05:16+00:00,lawmaster,Ethereum will remain more decentralized and Solana will likely never be as permissive in who can run the validators. It‚Äôs a multichain world where different chains have different tradeoffs. No need for cringe broskitos

3614,2021-07-20 05:08:59+00:00,lawmaster,@0xCryptoGenius @AltcoinPsycho @IamNomad I don‚Äôt believe so. With Tether this could be a bit more of an issue

3617,2021-07-20 04:46:50+00:00,lawmaster,"@AltcoinPsycho It depends what you perceive as safe. USDC can get frozen more easily than USDT.

3620,2021-07-19 10:27:40+00:00,lawmaster,@BigSky_7 @StaniKulechov If the front end is storing information (like text and pictures) then why do you think it would be difficult for governments to put the same pressure as they do on Twitter and Facebook to take down sensitive info?
3621,2021-07-19 10:15:36+00:00,lawmaster,"@StaniKulechov And if you don't store the information in decentralized storage then it's very likely going to be super easy for governments to actually force censorship even of the things that you wouldn't want, no? Where would the content be stored in this case?"
3622,2021-07-19 10:14:39+00:00,lawmaster,@StaniKulechov Then the question becomes - what is the business model of the interfaces? Wouldn't they need to display ads to fund the teams that would be doing the moderation? Or tx fee cut? These are 100+ people teams. Would users then need to pay to interact with the network?
3623,2021-07-19 10:08:55+00:00,lawmaster,@0xTomoyo @StaniKulechov And who's doing the moderation on the front-end level? Twitter and Facebook have teams of 100+ people to deal with this stuff in the background

3627,2021-07-19 10:00:20+00:00,lawmaster,@StaniKulechov Pretty much anyone that has tried to compete with Twitter failed miserably and for a good reason. The network effects are strong and moderation IMO can't be done by a community. How do you filter all the child porn and other stuff to make the network bearable?
3628,2021-07-19 09:58:39+00:00,lawmaster,"@StaniKulechov I am really highly skeptical that decentralized social media will take off anytime soon. Mainly because:

1. some censorship is always necessary and how do you walk the line?

2. not even L2s on Ethereum are scalable enough to be able to store all the information on social media"

3831,2021-06-16 07:22:44+00:00,lawmaster,"Saylor has gone into an absolute bulltard mode and will continue buying until he is admitted in a mental institution. More than a billion dollars of buy pressure right now in not-so-liquid books can go a long way. And of course, everyone is trying to front-run these buys."
3832,2021-06-16 07:22:44+00:00,lawmaster,DeFi is not going away. Pretty much all insti customers that we talk to at The Block Research are always interested in DeFi. Real L2s (and not sidechains) like Arbitrum/Optimism are coming online soon and will actually scale Ethereum for the first time. I think this can be huge
3833,2021-06-16 07:22:43+00:00,lawmaster,"The El Salvador development is clearly massive. There will surely be some hurdles along the way but if this becomes a trend, the market can turn into super bullish with just one announcement IMO. Bitcoin as legal tender in developing countries is really enormous"
3834,2021-06-16 07:22:43+00:00,lawmaster,So what do I make of it? Retail is basically gone just as quickly as it showed up. Markets are clearly in uncertainty. But will we have another multi-year bear market? I really don't think so. Not saying supercycle but I am convinced cycles will be much shorter
3835,2021-06-16 07:22:43+00:00,lawmaster,Balance sheet narrative started getting much weaker with the Elon flip. It's also going to be much more difficult to convince the board to allocate a significant amount of cash in Bitcoin after it crashed 50%+ in a couple of weeks. Or that BTC moves +-5% based on Elon's tweets
3836,2021-06-16 07:22:42+00:00,lawmaster,"As if that wasn't enough, China also started getting more serious about regulation (both mining and futures trading) and there was a lot of uncertainty. Hashrate is down almost 30% since the peak and still no one really knows the extent."
3837,2021-06-16 07:22:42+00:00,lawmaster,Market started looking weak. Even clearly made up FUD crashed Bitcoin and there weren't as many people buying the dip as before. Then Elon started completely flipping his position and virtue signaling about environmental concerns (that he clearly knew about before)
3838,2021-06-16 07:22:42+00:00,lawmaster,"Coinbase going public was grossly overhyped and the new interest couldn't support prices going up anymore. Retail started getting burnt on meme coins and got rug pulled on BSC time and time again. Meanwhile, none of the ETH DeFi was possible for normies when Uniswap tx cost $100+"
3839,2021-06-16 07:22:41+00:00,lawmaster,"Meanwhile, the market was desperately looking for another large company to announce they have allocated to continue the trend. Coinbase and NYDIG were both saying in Q1 that companies are lining up. None of that has materialized and insti inflows clearly slowed down."
3840,2021-06-16 07:22:41+00:00,lawmaster,"As prices rocketed up, we saw a clear significant inflow of retail customers. All the social indicators were far surpassing what we saw in 2017. A lot of trash and meme coins started rocketing up - full blow mania. Institutional capital wasn't in the driver's seat anymore. https://t.co/AOsvB2KxEO"
3841,2021-06-16 07:22:40+00:00,lawmaster,"What jump-started this market last year and attracted a lot of interest was undoubtedly institutional investment in Bitcoin as a macro hedge. MicroStrategy kicked off the balance sheet trend and when Tesla announced they allocated, the market exploded. It was a validated trend"
3842,2021-06-16 07:22:40+00:00,lawmaster,I've been asked by a few people what I think about the current market and the honest answer is that I have no fucking clue right now. I think no one knows. CT has just been a lot of noise and not much substance lately. Everyone is still down a lot and coping. My brain dump: https://t.co/koVmjXMSS0
3843,2021-06-15 18:34:16+00:00,lawmaster,@hasufl Thought about this as well a while ago. Arrived at the conclusion that it doesn't matter that so much of DEX volume is from arbs as long as the fees are being paid to LPs
3844,2021-06-15 17:59:42+00:00,lawmaster,"@TheStalwart Nothing, the moment has passed. These things are so momentum driven"
3845,2021-06-15 17:58:33+00:00,lawmaster,@SpencerApplebau Pretty much agree but what's mind-boggling is that they list stuff months or years after the massive demand spike that's unlikely to come back

3851,2021-06-15 11:27:03+00:00,lawmaster,@PenserETH @chatwithcharles @solana @rarestonecap Yes but I'm talking about what's currently happening. There isn't a single original/optimized app that works on BSC.
3852,2021-06-15 11:22:05+00:00,lawmaster,"@PenserETH @chatwithcharles @solana @rarestonecap I don't agree with that at all. There is a higher barrier of entry from already existing Solidity devs. There isn't a high barrier of entry long term from the entire dev pool. And from what I've seen so far, EVM compatible chains tend to get a shit ton of low effort fork scams"
3853,2021-06-15 11:19:29+00:00,lawmaster,@antiprosynth @chatwithcharles @solana @rarestonecap What mental gymnastics? Not being EVM compatible leads to teams focusing on originality of design with optimization in mind vs. low effort forks that copy Ethereum DeFi protocols.
3854,2021-06-15 11:07:41+00:00,lawmaster,@LSDinmycoffee @chatwithcharles @solana @rarestonecap I‚Äôve been telling solana team for months. They are aware lol
3855,2021-06-15 11:07:04+00:00,lawmaster,"@chatwithcharles @solana @rarestonecap Agree, I‚Äôve been impressed as well. I think a big reason is that there is no EVM compatibility and it‚Äôs just too difficult for scammers to write code that scams. No low effort forks like on BSC"
3856,2021-06-15 06:41:31+00:00,lawmaster,@PickACardHS @crypto_fruit Yep that‚Äôs me as well
3857,2021-06-15 05:49:51+00:00,lawmaster,@aeyakovenko @harrycanuck Because it‚Äôs something most serious people won‚Äôt want to be associated with. I can tell you myself this thing makes me uncomfortable and many people who are invested in SOL feel the same. There is good messaging and then there is this. You can accomplish the same in a better way
3858,2021-06-15 05:44:59+00:00,lawmaster,"@aeyakovenko @harrycanuck Oh come on, this is not light hearted fun. This is a message that‚Äôs being consciously blasted to 1M+ TikTok users who don‚Äôt know any better. I like Solana‚Äôs direction but this is probably the largest misstep I saw so far"
3859,2021-06-15 04:59:00+00:00,lawmaster,@harrycanuck Agree this is hard to watch
3860,2021-06-15 04:53:20+00:00,lawmaster,It‚Äôs genuinely hard to believe that someone at Solana approved this campaign and thinks it‚Äôs a good idea. Reaching new audiences on TikTok sure but through this messaging is just sad

3862,2021-06-14 19:59:56+00:00,lawmaster,@haydenzadams @cewh1te Why does that matter if you can withdraw USDC after trading ETH/USD on Coinbase as a person with no US bank account?
3863,2021-06-14 19:50:21+00:00,lawmaster,@haydenzadams How come? USD and USDC is interchangeable on Coinbase for example
3864,2021-06-14 19:45:00+00:00,lawmaster,Still impressive nonetheless though no doubt but comparing to USDC pairs doesn't make too much sense to me.
3865,2021-06-14 19:44:59+00:00,lawmaster,"USDC pairs are not popular on CEXs. The more accurate comparison with CEXs:

$2.1bn - Binance ETH/USDT
$1bn - Huobi ETH/USDT
$595m - Binance ETH/BUSD
$520m - Coinbase ETH/USD
$250m - Uniswap v3 ETH/USDC (0.3% fee)
$222m - Kraken ETH/USD

3884,2021-06-13 18:12:06+00:00,lawmaster,"@mattysino Two problems that I have with it - even though them selling in stealth didn‚Äôt affect the market, Elon‚Äôs tweets still move BTC price by +-5%. Secondly, how do you determine the energy mix? Having 50% of hashrate from renewables is years away with reasonable certainty IMO"
3885,2021-06-13 17:15:42+00:00,lawmaster,"@antiprosynth @HsakaTrades Agreed. If your time horizon is long and you focus on the few solid protocols, that‚Äôs quite a good thesis IMO"
3886,2021-06-13 17:06:49+00:00,lawmaster,@antiprosynth @HsakaTrades Pure cope. What matters is the drop from the previous high. If the demand for DeFi revolves around what the price of Bitcoin is doing then it‚Äôs just too early.
3887,2021-06-13 15:25:47+00:00,lawmaster,@HsakaTrades Demand for transactions is virtually zero and DeFi ‚Äúrevenue‚Äù is dropping like a stone as well. Not the greatest sign when DeFi activity dies off on a market slow down. Still long ways to go

4182,2021-05-26 05:09:18+00:00,lawmaster,@ryanallis @santiagoroel That's not my point. My point is that low cap marketing coins will outperform Bitcoin and Ethereum anyways regardless of whether it's productive or not. That's not changing anytime soon unfortunately
4183,2021-05-26 05:06:00+00:00,lawmaster,"@santiagoroel Again, I'm not gonna bet on mcap of DeFi because it's incredibly easy to dilute by new projects launching and just stacking up on illiquid mcap.

4184,2021-05-26 05:04:06+00:00,lawmaster,"@santiagoroel By your logic, if you believe that we will be in a bull market for the next few years, the best outcome would be to sell DeFi and buy XRP and ADA because they will outperform too."

Obviously low cap DeFi tokens will outperform Bitcoin but in no way does that mean they are breaking away from Bitcoin like you imply in the tweet.

4225,2021-05-24 05:08:02+00:00,lawmaster,@Fiskantes What this also doesn‚Äôt caveat is that some revenue of some of these protocols is basically generated by selling the native governance tokens.

4241,2021-05-23 15:32:13+00:00,lawmaster,This took much longer than I thought but IMO a big reason for why we‚Äôre seeing 60% super quick crashes is that there was just way too many projects stretched to crazy valuations and not enough liquidity to support the prices when new demand dries up.

4381,2021-05-12 18:19:20+00:00,lawmaster,My guess is that he did this because it clogged Ethereum and caused gas to be consistently above 400. Uniswap swaps were $300+ because of these tokens and they were quite literally useless. Ethereum was unusable and led to really shitty activity.

4760,2021-04-27 15:40:41+00:00,lawmaster,I think the main takeaway from Polygon growing so rapidly is that there is a massive appetite to have rollups launch as soon as possible. And now there is basically zero doubt in my mind they take off quickly after launch barring any serious issues

5041,2021-04-12 04:49:31+00:00,lawmaster,@sassal0x @econoar Well to be clear I think BSC has close to 0 chance succeeding long term. The set of trade offs they make is just not sustainable long term. But it would be foolish to say that these low-fee L1s aren‚Äôt eating a lot of usecases away from Ethereum right now and onboarding new users
5042,2021-04-12 04:45:24+00:00,lawmaster,@sassal0x My point is that competing for digital gold is now over. That ship has sailed. Competing for the go-to smart contract platform is still possible (although low chance) and I think we see multi-chain future regardless if Ethereum is by far the leading L1
5043,2021-04-12 04:42:24+00:00,lawmaster,@sassal0x It‚Äôs possible it will happen by one of the smart contract platforms but at this time I‚Äôd say that chance is close to 0
5044,2021-04-12 04:41:28+00:00,lawmaster,@sassal0x Because it was the first. The forks died because they focused their narratives on things that didn‚Äôt pan out not because they were less decentralized
5045,2021-04-12 04:39:27+00:00,lawmaster,"@sassal0x Still very very different. One can have multiple winners and the other will only have one that‚Äôs unlikely to be surpassed. Way before macro investors and corporates started investing, Bitcoin was already the most popular collateral and reserve asset"
5046,2021-04-12 04:37:19+00:00,lawmaster,@sassal0x I think the best argument for Ethereum sustaining its multi year advantage and network effects is that developers are ideological and they will stay with the chain that has the most decentralized infrastructure. But it‚Äôs not hard to see why people would want to spread their bets
5047,2021-04-12 04:34:15+00:00,lawmaster,"@sassal0x That‚Äôs not even close to the same thing though. Bitcoin was the first and it‚Äôs established itself as digital gold that macro investors and corporates invest to hedge inflation. Competing against that would be literally braindead. As much as I like Ethereum, it‚Äôs not as clear cut"

5209,2021-04-04 06:15:07+00:00,lawmaster,Another important parameter is obviously censorship resistance and the project‚Äôs plan (and its feasibility) to get there. Projects like BSC that don‚Äôt have a feasible plan to ‚Äúdecentralize‚Äù sustainably are an automatic pass for me if I‚Äôm thinking long term. Short term it‚Äôs fine

5213,2021-04-04 05:51:11+00:00,lawmaster,"By looking at these parameters, nothing comes close to Ethereum and likely won't for quite some time.

EVM-compatible chains obviously have an advantage since porting infra and developers is easier."

5407,2021-03-15 10:04:09+00:00,lawmaster,@Nakameowdough It's a combination of factors. FTX has traders that are way more sophisticated (less leverage) and it also has a much better liquidation mechanism. But basically yes

5413,2021-03-15 09:05:19+00:00,lawmaster,"@Rewkang It's not an issue at all but it doesn't disincentivize wash trading.

5417,2021-03-15 04:59:03+00:00,lawmaster,@Rewkang You mention that Binance would need to pay $2M a day ($730M annualized) to wash trade but that‚Äôs not really correct if we assume that the vast majority of liquidity is being provided by Binance itself.

5421,2021-03-14 17:49:38+00:00,lawmaster,@lightcrypto Yea I agree but think that some NFTs that capture users outside of the crypto bubble will actually largely avoid this. Which is why Top Shot is a decent hedge that performs quite differently than anything else on Ethereum
5422,2021-03-14 12:59:04+00:00,lawmaster,@austerity_sucks Yea I agree. The most obvious (and simple) answer is an OpenSea token.

This only goes to show that a lot of this rally is being driven by institutional capital and there isn‚Äôt that much retail yet. 56% of traffic is from Binance and Coinbase https://t.co/tsSoNlhmgh"
5510,2021-03-08 11:19:46+00:00,lawmaster,"2/ First let‚Äôs look at market structure. 

Spot volume reached another all-time high of more than $1T last month. More than 3 times higher than 2017 top. When it comes to exchanges supporting fiat, Coinbase comfortably leads, followed by Kraken, Upbit, LMAX Digital and Bitfinex. https://t.co/vHir0BZyZr"

5525,2021-03-05 06:14:00+00:00,lawmaster,@ki_young_ju @Tesla I don‚Äôt think this actually necessarily means much.

5606,2021-03-01 11:51:28+00:00,lawmaster,@GrennHouseGas @PenserETH I agree that Flow right now is a permissioned database. But it's undoubtedly better than a closed up database where you have no transparency over what's happening there.

5607,2021-03-01 11:37:17+00:00,lawmaster,@sassal0x @CL207 Right but I think that's mainly because both of us are incredibly fortunate in life and have made decisions that don't make us have to do that. A lot of people in the world are very talented but dirt poor

5611,2021-03-01 11:20:47+00:00,lawmaster,"@GrennHouseGas @PenserETH Mainly, if you don't think that Top Shot is making a trade off that you are willing to make then you can opt out and not interact with it.

5612,2021-03-01 11:19:34+00:00,lawmaster,@GrennHouseGas @PenserETH The problem is that you simply can't scale NFTs on Ethereum to 100k+ users. So there are two options - you either wait for some L2 to solve this (could be months) or you have to build on a pseudoblockchain that's not decentralized but at least transparent. It's a trade off

5707,2021-02-24 21:45:55+00:00,lawmaster,"@kevinsekniqi @Beler @calchulus You are thinking long term, which is true. I‚Äôm thinking somewhat short term and worried about 50%+ DeFi pullback"
5708,2021-02-24 21:43:26+00:00,lawmaster,@Beler @kevinsekniqi @calchulus Competition is always good. What I‚Äôm starting to get uneasy about is the effect this trend of creating the same products in 5+ L1s will have on DeFi blue chips and the overall market non-BTC market
5709,2021-02-24 21:40:51+00:00,lawmaster,@spreekaway Yea most of the people disagreeing are only reassuring me my thesis is likely correct
5710,2021-02-24 21:38:03+00:00,lawmaster,"@kevinsekniqi @calchulus Precisely proving my point though. Some VC might read that now and get confused. If they invest in Uniswap, are they not backing the fastest horse? Some might thing the same about PancakeSwap. The end goal is that they get confused and less confident in today‚Äôs blue chips."
5711,2021-02-24 21:32:44+00:00,lawmaster,"@kevinsekniqi @calchulus Whether copy or not is not important for my point.

5716,2021-02-24 20:52:53+00:00,lawmaster,"@calchulus Yep. Investing in Uniswap and Aave is a nobrainer if you are a VC looking in and wanting exposure. It becomes much more difficult to make that choice as an uninformed outsider if you can also buy Uniswap copy on Solana, Avalanche and BSC. It's just what it is"
5717,2021-02-24 20:46:16+00:00,lawmaster,"This isn't even crying about projects being created outside of Ethereum. I don't really care personally, I will go where most of the activity is with decentralization guarantees. I'm just worried that dilution of capital will really fuck these markets up. Not enough demand"
5718,2021-02-24 20:36:42+00:00,lawmaster,"We are starting to see carbon copies of Uniswap, Aave, Synthetix and other succesful DeFi procols across like 5+ popular L1s. Everyone bids them up and uses ETH valuations as a comparison with no intention of holding them long term. Good luck for that lasting for a long time"
5719,2021-02-24 20:35:04+00:00,lawmaster,The implication of doing 1:1 forks of Ethereum projects but on all the other competing L1s are actually larger than people realize. There are a shit ton of L1s and valuations are already stretched out even on Ethereum. The dilution of buyers and money can IMO cause serious issues
5720,2021-02-24 18:04:19+00:00,lawmaster,@vechainoracle This is just the one that goes to the protocol. The previous tweet shows total revenue

5722,2021-02-24 16:28:50+00:00,lawmaster,"@Fiskantes @SBF_Alameda Yea, I think we will try to add one chart that measures how much of the inflation goes into incentives. And measure ""expenses"" by this. But yea, it starts getting quite complicated when you start doing that"
5723,2021-02-24 16:23:21+00:00,lawmaster,@SBF_Alameda It's also much harder (maybe impossible) to be able to launch a token with the fee option being turned on without being considered a clear security in the US. So there are good arguments for doing it this way for the first stages of a token IMO
5724,2021-02-24 16:20:22+00:00,lawmaster,"@SBF_Alameda I think the argument against this is that some projects are purely in the customer acquisition pre-revenue mode. And as long as there is an expectation of the fee being turned on at some point in the future, investors seem to not be worried based on the price action"
5725,2021-02-24 14:42:45+00:00,lawmaster,"@greyswan_ @ProjectSerum This infrastructure has so far been built out for Ethereum. But if @SBF_Alameda has APIs for this, we could very easily plug it in. Eventually we could support Solana as well but as you can imagine it's a lot of work"

5834,2021-02-20 14:42:01+00:00,lawmaster,@ceterispar1bus That's incredible
5835,2021-02-20 14:13:32+00:00,lawmaster,@calchulus @PancakeSwap @VenusProtocol @beefyfinance I mean it's mainly CZ doing that tbh. And just sets terrible precedent. It's just throwing buzzwords in hopes of getting regulators confused.
5836,2021-02-20 14:11:17+00:00,lawmaster,"@calchulus In a high-fee environment, something like BSC makes sense for users that are priced out from Ethereum. And it's a good testing ground for noobs. But it optimizes for short-term performance while not really thinking long term. Eventually it will fail"
5837,2021-02-20 14:09:47+00:00,lawmaster,@calchulus This is a pretty good thread. Agree with a lot of it. One thing I don't understand though is why does Binance constantly lie about the decentralized aspect and tries to take down Ethereum so much. Comes across as desperate and insincere tbh
5838,2021-02-20 14:01:52+00:00,lawmaster,@calchulus Most of these fees (if not all) are passed on to the user itself. So not sure how that's relevant tbh
5839,2021-02-20 13:59:28+00:00,lawmaster,"@calchulus This is an understatement. As far as I know, Binance runs all the nodes and has full control over the chain. That being said, they are not exactly incentivized to act maliciously. That might no longer be the case at some point in the future though"
5840,2021-02-20 10:20:01+00:00,lawmaster,@udiWertheimer Short lived trend IMO with BSC. Don't believe it will last for that long but we shall see
5841,2021-02-20 10:16:44+00:00,lawmaster,@udiWertheimer Don't get excited too early. Still ~11 months to go. Binance Chain USDT volumes (which are not even native) are gonna trend to 0 long term and TBD on TRON
5842,2021-02-20 10:04:23+00:00,lawmaster,"@GrennHouseGas @PenserETH @HsakaTrades I agree and that's very likely what's happening. But if you believe that, you should LP there as well and collect the subsidy that Binance is willing to pay you. As long as anyone can LP, it's fair game. Eventually enough people will LP and Binance will likely stop a lot of it"
5843,2021-02-20 10:00:53+00:00,lawmaster,"@PenserETH @HsakaTrades @ChainLinkGod It's obvious that Binance provides the vast majority of liquidity and that these is a shit ton of arbs and likely some wash trading. My point is that as long as anyone can LP and earn the fees, it shouldn't matter as long as these volumes sustain. Uniswap is a lot of arb too"
5844,2021-02-20 09:56:33+00:00,lawmaster,@PenserETH @HsakaTrades We could argue about whether this volume is sustainable. I don't personally think so. But 0.17% fee goes to LPs and 0.03% goes to the treasury and is burnt. Uniswap charges a 0.30% fee on all trades so Uniswap LPs get ~1.8 times more but both still earn
5845,2021-02-20 09:53:00+00:00,lawmaster,"@PenserETH @HsakaTrades A shit ton of volume on PancakeSwap is just pure arbitrage and I'm sure some wash trading as well (but not that much). However, as long as the protocol allows anyone to LP and then distributes the fee to them, does it really matter? LPs get paid regardless if it's a wash trade"

6003,2021-02-11 10:33:16+00:00,lawmaster,@BlockEnthusiast @scupytrooples Your mistake is assuming that most of BSC users are not in it to just gamble on coins that are about to list on Binance. It's a cheap lottery ticket. You won't accomplish anything by putting a layer on top

6034,2021-02-10 09:09:46+00:00,lawmaster,"My general sentiment is that in the long term decentralization wins. In the short term and especially in a mania, no one fucking cares.

6048,2021-02-10 06:13:12+00:00,lawmaster,@econoar I mean a high percentage of Uniswap‚Äôs volume is ETH and USDC/USDT/DAI as well. Retail is interested in farming and getting access to shitcoins before they list. The advantage of PancakeSwap is that a lot of shitcoins will autolist on Binance

6059,2021-02-09 16:36:17+00:00,lawmaster,"@HsakaTrades Short term though it can definitely suck off some liquidity. And if someone can pull off an efficient bridge from ETH, it's gonna be Binance"
6060,2021-02-09 16:34:12+00:00,lawmaster,"@HsakaTrades The main challenge for BSC will be the assets available.

6078,2021-02-09 06:32:11+00:00,lawmaster,"@ChainLinkGod @DeFiGod1 Most of the real world‚Äôs collectibles have relatively large communities, which makes it less likely that it will just fall off.

6116,2021-02-06 12:27:10+00:00,lawmaster,@hasufl @JonGalt14 Yes exactly and also look at fees that Curve generates. It's about 7 times lower for comparable volume. Uniswap's volume was 5 times larger than Curve's in Jan so fees generated by LPs are ~35 times lower than Uniswap. Obviously Uniswap doesn't distribute to token holders though

6421,2021-01-24 05:19:13+00:00,lawmaster,@DeezeFi @MoonOverlord @basedkarbon That‚Äôs actually exactly the problem IMO. I don‚Äôt think there is much room to grow whereas with Top Shot you can easily 100x the number of users and I wouldn‚Äôt be shocked. It can obviously also fail but the upside is very different
6422,2021-01-23 20:36:22+00:00,lawmaster,"@MoonOverlord @basedkarbon Also, it‚Äôs not exactly controversial being bullish one NFT collectibles and bearish another one. They are both massively different"
6423,2021-01-23 20:29:53+00:00,lawmaster,"@MoonOverlord @basedkarbon There is a big difference in TAM and also I was super early to Top Shot, punks are already overshilled so much"

Maim difference for me is that I believe that punks have ultra tiny TAM and rely on ETH whales wanting to flex. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm more positive on NBA Top Shot where I believe the TAM is much much larger similar to BTC/ETH.

6431,2021-01-23 19:53:54+00:00,lawmaster,@statelayer @setanimals @scott_lew_is @icebergy_ @satsloser I think I sort of see some value in it being scarce and the first. The main issue is that it's a small niche thing with a target client being rich ETH whales. Just not exciting for me
6432,2021-01-23 19:48:32+00:00,lawmaster,@degenomix @icebergy_ @satsloser @nba_topshot I actually am way more bullish NBA cards and have exposure as well https://t.co/4s4jWvrCh6
6433,2021-01-23 19:44:27+00:00,lawmaster,@scott_lew_is @icebergy_ @satsloser I mean sure yea I could see it then as well and could sort of rationalize $10k for early ones. But why would someone purchase for near million right now? No chance they can sell them for any reasonable ROI so basically just an expensive on-chain flex?
6434,2021-01-23 19:39:13+00:00,lawmaster,@69420zz @basedkarbon @satsloser @icebergy_ @0x_b1 I think mainly because Flow is a centralized chain and it's not on Ethereum. Which ironically is the only way it can actually scale now
6435,2021-01-23 19:35:47+00:00,lawmaster,"@satsloser @icebergy_ It's just a ""I have a big dick"" certificate for ETH whales. On-chain flex that you have fuck you money"

6437,2021-01-23 19:30:33+00:00,lawmaster,@basedkarbon @satsloser @icebergy_ @0x_b1 Because Top Shot can actually scale to total noobs buying this just like regular sports cards. CryptoPunks are a forced meme circle jerked by crypto OGs. Everyone forgets what happens when ETH NFTs get too popular and Ethereum can't handle it
6438,2021-01-23 19:24:21+00:00,lawmaster,@icebergy_ @satsloser I doubt it honestly but I guess some could be. Would like to actually talk to someone who bought one for $500k+ and hear them rationalize it. It makes no sense. Store of value meme is so bad
6439,2021-01-23 19:22:10+00:00,lawmaster,@satsloser @icebergy_ It's not a coincidence you now see literally everyone with CryptoPunk bags retweet that and shill their bags. We saw the same exact stuff with CryptoKitties in 2017. All about marketing
6440,2021-01-23 19:20:20+00:00,lawmaster,@satsloser @icebergy_ These super high priced purchases are likely just free marketing and some sort of washtrading. Very much doubt that someone is actually paying this much for an NFT

6442,2021-01-23 17:31:49+00:00,lawmaster,@chasejthompson @econoar I don‚Äôt personally. Uniswap is more like Binance since it doesn‚Äôt have on ramps. Regulated on ramps will always be necessary on top of DEXs
6443,2021-01-23 17:19:04+00:00,lawmaster,@spreekaway @IslandHunting @econoar Yea me as well. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs even close
6444,2021-01-23 17:18:12+00:00,lawmaster,@econoar Coinbase revenues are likely gonna be slightly larger than a billion. But their profit margins are enormous. Uniswap still has way too many unknowns and no token holder cash flows yet so agree with you re: governance developments
6445,2021-01-23 17:15:07+00:00,lawmaster,@blockomoco @econoar Idk honestly. Certainly shouldn‚Äôt be 1:1 for several reasons but some repricing likely in order

6450,2021-01-23 14:21:49+00:00,lawmaster,"@MoonOverlord @MeatTC_ The massive benefit here is that they have quite literally the perfect dataset for the secondary market so if they are smart, they will always balance out demand/supply so there is always slightly more demand than available supply.

6451,2021-01-23 14:16:22+00:00,lawmaster,@MeatTC_ @MoonOverlord Yea although I‚Äôd like to think they learn from the previous CryptoKitties issues too and avoid these issues. The project has what it takes including the backing of a few known NBA players
6452,2021-01-23 14:10:27+00:00,lawmaster,@MoonOverlord What‚Äôs exciting about Top Shot is that very few people still know about it and that it won‚Äôt get cucked by on-chain limitations. What‚Äôs a bit concerning is that they might over-inflate the cards long term

6460,2021-01-23 08:02:55+00:00,lawmaster,@Tetranode @latetot Everyone is misunderstanding my point.

6465,2021-01-23 07:14:58+00:00,lawmaster,@SBF_Alameda @LeVraiEntruv @danheld It would absolutely survive but short term would be quite messy imo and not good.

6484,2021-01-22 16:54:23+00:00,lawmaster,@cryptodiario What I think is a short lived meme is saying that you can build multi billion dollar protocols that sustain value without taking some outside investment. So many of the more complex protocols are impossible to build and sustain that way
6485,2021-01-22 16:47:33+00:00,lawmaster,"@CryptoCatVC @ParadexIO @airswap @MakerDAO That‚Äôs not because of fair launch though, that‚Äôs because of incentives + actual interest now"
6486,2021-01-22 16:46:25+00:00,lawmaster,@setanimals Yes but you can get to relatively fair launch even with outside funding. The notion of not needing to raise from VCs too bootstrap a community is so wrong imo
6487,2021-01-22 16:45:22+00:00,lawmaster,@tklocanas @fintechfrank @TheBlock__ Let me look into it. Are you aware of any data sources for these volumes? We are unfortunately replacing Dune with different providers
6488,2021-01-22 16:43:47+00:00,lawmaster,@DegenSpartan Yes absolutely but it would have died regardless have there not been new development. The fair launch was basically when this thing was $0.3 and no one wanted to to touch it
6489,2021-01-22 16:41:18+00:00,lawmaster,@RyanWatkins_ @haydenzadams I read the thread and both examples you used make very little sense with what we know now
6490,2021-01-22 16:40:14+00:00,lawmaster,"@gabrielhaines Nomi returned the money. So your thesis is that if there was no exit scam and Sushi just functioned as a simple fork, it would get as much interest as today and wouldn‚Äôt die? Lol come on"
6491,2021-01-22 16:38:21+00:00,lawmaster,@gabrielhaines And then basically died
6492,2021-01-22 16:35:23+00:00,lawmaster,Perfect example of my point is that literally no one cared about Sushi until the dev team starting building new features. It was near 30 cents and then the narrative started changing and became more than just a fork. Its success today has nothing to do with a fair launch
6493,2021-01-22 16:32:24+00:00,lawmaster,@CryptoCatVC Is there an example of a useful DeFi protocol that hasn‚Äôt been able to attract a community and interest? Incentives are super important but devs are way more important initially
6494,2021-01-22 16:30:37+00:00,lawmaster,@iamDCinvestor @RyanWatkins_ Exactly. Taking some outside funding is very often the right path to take. Would Uniswap or Aave be possible with a fair launch? I certainly have my doubts
6495,2021-01-22 16:28:34+00:00,lawmaster,@RyanWatkins_ YFI is is certainly having doubts about the way it was launched and the tokens distributed.
6496,2021-01-22 16:25:22+00:00,lawmaster,@RyanWatkins_ Would Uniswap be able to fair launch without funding? You can ask @haydenzadams but I‚Äôm pretty sure it wouldn‚Äôt be possible
6497,2021-01-22 16:24:05+00:00,lawmaster,@RyanWatkins_ It‚Äôs easy to allow organizations to launch without funding when all you do is fork code and start an economic incentive attack. That‚Äôs not really doable for many other projects
6498,2021-01-22 16:21:30+00:00,lawmaster,DeFi protocols are all about the devs. A good useful protocol is what attracts interests and narratives. And you need to incentivize the devs to make sure it stays that way.
6499,2021-01-22 16:14:39+00:00,lawmaster,It has since grown past that but Sushi quite literally forked a protocol and initially got value because it attempted to vampire fork. Its success had nothing to do with a fair launch. Fair launch is a short lived meme and an easy narrative to sell

6610,2021-01-16 15:57:33+00:00,lawmaster,Can Tether be affected by U.S. regulators for the previous issues or other reasons? Probably but I think it's a relatively low chance but definitely something to be wary of. But do I believe that Tether is misappropriating the funds or acting fraudulently? I really don't.
6611,2021-01-16 15:57:32+00:00,lawmaster,"Most of them also think that the only reason I've changed my mind is that I've somehow been paid off by Tether, it's ridiculous.

6612,2021-01-16 15:57:32+00:00,lawmaster,So much of the Tether criticism is just lazily jumping to conclusions these days. And I've now blocked most of the accounts that spread this shit without even understanding how to get the correct data to support their arguments.
6613,2021-01-16 15:57:32+00:00,lawmaster,I used to be one of the leading voices of Tether criticism but I can say with 100% honesty that the vast majority of Tether critics don't understand crypto market structure and it's making them make bad assumptions. They also don't have the network to figure out the nuance.
6614,2021-01-16 11:43:52+00:00,lawmaster,@mayazi I think you‚Äôre wrong but maybe we will find out. But Tether is incredibly important for miners and as collateral for perps and I can‚Äôt see any of the current alternatives replacing it well. USDC/PAX won‚Äôt be able to and algo def not. Likely would shift back to BTC imo
6615,2021-01-16 11:40:21+00:00,lawmaster,@mayazi You think traders that do billions of volume will trust trash algo stablecoins to collateralize their massive positions? I can basically guarantee that‚Äôs not the case

Binance would all of the sudden struggle and basically all derivatives are collateralized by Tether now. Very unlikely perps will be allowed to function with USDC. And then what about China?

6634,2021-01-14 22:20:27+00:00,lawmaster,@hasufl @bantg @MonetSupply @KoltenB_ Exactly
6635,2021-01-14 22:13:37+00:00,lawmaster,@notsofast @MonetSupply @bantg @KoltenB_ @hasufl This is my reasoning as well. Not because I don‚Äôt agree that this is the right move but because I think it will spook a large portion of the super early investors. That‚Äôs scary
6636,2021-01-14 22:08:33+00:00,lawmaster,@MonetSupply @bantg @KoltenB_ @hasufl This is spot on
6637,2021-01-14 22:00:20+00:00,lawmaster,"@MonetSupply @bantg @KoltenB_ @hasufl Agreed. All I‚Äôm saying is that getting rid of a strong narrative could do weird things to price short term. Long term, this would very likely be much better"

6639,2021-01-14 21:53:38+00:00,lawmaster,@bantg @KoltenB_ @MonetSupply @hasufl Yea that‚Äôs true. I guess anecdotally what I heard from early investors then was that one of the reasons they are supporting the project is the capped supply and a simple narrative. It was a really strong narrative then
6640,2021-01-14 21:36:16+00:00,lawmaster,@hasufl Agreed and also breaks a pretty fundamental promise that was there since day 1. Arguably helped bootstrap the project and was treated as a near guarantee. Can‚Äôt really imagine the short term price liking that but who knows
6641,2021-01-14 21:22:54+00:00,lawmaster,@CasPiancey @StrongHandDan @DanielSingerS If it ever does come out that Tether has invested meaningful amount of clients‚Äô dollars in bitcoins then I will definitely completely change my mind. I am nearly certain that‚Äôs not the case though
6642,2021-01-14 21:15:54+00:00,lawmaster,@CasPiancey @DanielSingerS It is possible but there are other logical explanations for this. One thing I wish you would do better yourself is not jumping to conclusions with other potential possibilities.
6643,2021-01-14 21:14:10+00:00,lawmaster,@DanielSingerS @CasPiancey Yep. I don‚Äôt think anyone should be jumping to conclusions but it‚Äôs certainly a possibility
6644,2021-01-14 21:11:53+00:00,lawmaster,@DanielSingerS @CasPiancey The fact that Deltec owns Bitcoin on behalf of clients? Not necessarily. We don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs on behalf of Bitfinex/Tether
6645,2021-01-14 21:07:05+00:00,lawmaster,@CasPiancey I think finex having equity in Deltec is likely but why wouldn‚Äôt they just hold Bitcoin directly through their own custody instead of holding at a bank?
6646,2021-01-14 21:03:59+00:00,lawmaster,@CasPiancey I mean what‚Äôs your theory?
6647,2021-01-14 21:02:38+00:00,lawmaster,@CasPiancey Not sure why tbh
6648,2021-01-14 21:01:15+00:00,lawmaster,"@CasPiancey One thing that doesn‚Äôt make sense is why would Deltec hold Bitcoin for Tether if Bitfinex has all the infra in the world to do it directly. Much likelier, Bitfinex helps them let Deltec‚Äôs other clients get exposure and then custody it"

6745,2021-01-11 09:25:36+00:00,lawmaster,"@davidiach I could be wrong here but I am fairly certain this was the second highest liquidation amount. First was March 2020, then this one and then the Thanksgiving massacre."

6758,2021-01-10 16:16:56+00:00,lawmaster,Gamers are getting ultra fucked because of miners again. You can't get last gen or new gen GPUs anywhere. Sold out and being resold for much much higher prices. Equity analysts are going to underestimate the effect again
6759,2021-01-10 16:13:59+00:00,lawmaster,"Similarly to what we've seen in 2017, the unintended consequence of miners making a killing in GPU-mineable coins is that nearly all GPUs are sold out everywhere and reselling at massive premiums.

6783,2021-01-09 13:16:20+00:00,lawmaster,@ASvanevik @pedrouid Mainly there was literally no other option if they wanted to operate how they did. Every unregulated exchange only supported USDT as it was the only option to avoid regulations and function globally

6866,2021-01-04 13:06:14+00:00,lawmaster,@HsakaTrades @TrueCrypto28 I don't think so. March this year was $1.6 billion on BitMEX alone. But will be super close

6884,2021-01-04 07:08:23+00:00,lawmaster,@econoar Not about Solana. I would use Solana or really whatever if what I needed to do was on it and if the assets that I use are on it. That's not the case currently since everything is on Ethereum

6988,2020-12-28 19:43:32+00:00,lawmaster,I really wouldn't expect delistings from exchanges that are not serving U.S. customers. Not anytime soon at least. I can't see Binance delisting anytime soon. It is possible other securities regulators follow the SEC but that will likely take a while
6989,2020-12-28 19:41:23+00:00,lawmaster,Some perspective for you guys. XRP delistings aren't exactly the same. Coinbase and Bitstamp are the main ones that matter (who serve U.S. customers) and Bitstamp's main market is Europe. So this is really all about Coinbase. https://t.co/Jo61FCApqH

7097,2020-12-22 19:03:12+00:00,lawmaster,"@el33th4xor Most people don‚Äôt realize this but USD on ramps are pretty much essential for Ripple to work for the remittance use case. If they lose that on-ramp, it‚Äôs gonna be tough. And all US financial instantly pull out if that happens"
7098,2020-12-22 19:01:57+00:00,lawmaster,"@el33th4xor I think exchanges might be pressured to delist and if you take out all liquidity coming from US based exchanges, it‚Äôs gonna be tough for Ripple.

7138,2020-12-19 15:07:36+00:00,lawmaster,@lalleclausen @Dogetoshi Yea I 100% agree with that. Plan to participate regardless but not super bullish if it lists $30bn+
7139,2020-12-19 15:01:53+00:00,lawmaster,"@lalleclausen @Dogetoshi The growth potential isn‚Äôt fantastic at purely transaction revenue, way overpriced fees that are about to compress and the custody business, which doesn‚Äôt make much.

Not a rule but $50b+ would literally be nuts"
7142,2020-12-19 14:14:51+00:00,lawmaster,@Dogetoshi Not that it‚Äôs a perfect comparison but Nasdaq does $5 billion of revenue and trades at $21bn. Coinbase will do less than $2bn of revenue and fees will only compress long term. Would be quite crazy if it trades at above $40 billion

7163,2020-12-18 22:32:13+00:00,lawmaster,@ercwl It‚Äôs clearly an attack on users‚Äô privacy though and isn‚Äôt compatible at all with DeFi and other protocols that you can‚Äôt KYC.

7594,2020-11-27 10:54:23+00:00,lawmaster,@mattysino That‚Äôs expected IMO since most people assumed that the coins were seized because of the on-chain activity + big PlusToken arrests. It was not confirmed officially though and the amounts were not clear

7705,2020-11-22 08:08:45+00:00,lawmaster,My guess would be that Paxos is not sourcing all of PayPal's volume through itBit's exchange. itBit also runs an OTC desk and a lot of it wouldn't show up on the orderbooks.

7717,2020-11-20 05:10:25+00:00,lawmaster,@mhonkasalo To me it was clearly successful because of marketing. UNI rewards made some people a lot of money and that positive association tends to stick.

""The root cause was traced to several components within our infrastructure which were locked to an older stable version of the go-ethereum client which encountered a critical consensus bug at block 11234873."" https://t.co/ImVMk52srb"
7798,2020-11-11 11:18:12+00:00,lawmaster,"Much more complete explanation is here. Infura didn't update their node perhaps because it reduces node uptime and they only update when it comes to hard forks and critical issues

7801,2020-11-11 10:31:43+00:00,lawmaster,@Rand_1337 @nikzh @Blockchair @infura_io Geth or Parity? Seems to be an issue with only Geth nodes

7803,2020-11-11 10:19:41+00:00,lawmaster,"Per @nikzh, Ethereum devs introduced a change in the code and some companies weren't aware (Bloickchair and Infura). This led to them being stuck on a minority chain. Basically an unannounced hardfork. Crazy that this is possible

7806,2020-11-11 09:47:41+00:00,lawmaster,@mrauchs I think they are running their own node but afaict Binance is not sure if there was a chain split since some block explorers are showing conflicting information. So they are investigating a chain split just out of caution

7814,2020-11-11 08:53:42+00:00,lawmaster,There are also some discrepancies between different block explorer. Some block explorers are showing a chain split at block 11234873. The blocks are different in different explorers. This is likely just because block explorers are using Infura for data https://t.co/Hvz9uWPqtE
7815,2020-11-11 08:48:00+00:00,lawmaster,The consequence of this is that gas is super low. Most people don't know they can switch their Metamask from infura https://t.co/1uEHSCAd3c

7817,2020-11-11 08:44:36+00:00,lawmaster,It seems like Infura is having an outage which is causing some pretty big delay in price feeds and some exchanges are also delaying withdrawals of ETH and ERC-20's. Metamask also having issues. There could also be an effect on some DeFi stuff

7937,2020-10-26 07:25:34+00:00,lawmaster,@udiWertheimer @SBF_Alameda Difference is that on DEXs someone pays the fees whereas with CEXs it costs nothing for the exchange to produce fake numbers

7952,2020-10-23 10:38:44+00:00,lawmaster,One of the most important concerns that the SEC had when it came to approving the Bitcoin ETF was not having oversight over unregulated exchanges where price discovery happens. CME being the leading futures exchange will help that greatly.

7954,2020-10-23 10:04:49+00:00,lawmaster,"If we look at the total amount of ETH in Tornado Cash pool, the KuCoin hacker could be as much as a third of all ETH there. Maybe already withdrew something but still. This is a terrible idea https://t.co/eDxr43iqEp"
7955,2020-10-23 09:50:01+00:00,lawmaster,I'd be shocked if the hacker didn't mess up and doxx himself in the process. The amount of ETH in Tornado cash is still quite small and this is likely more than 10k ETH that was sent there just from the hacker. I guess we might find out at some point
7956,2020-10-23 09:48:46+00:00,lawmaster,"What the hacker did:

1. steal all ERC-20 tokens from KuCoin

2. convert the permissionless ones to ETH using Uniswap (and sometimes Kyber)

3. Disperse the ETH to multiple addresses

4. Start using Tornado cash to mix the amounts and then likely cash-out"
7957,2020-10-23 09:31:26+00:00,lawmaster,"Ok, upon closer evaluation, this is not the first time the KuCoin hacker used Tornado cash. This is just the first time he did it from the public address and not from the side ones. Check here:

Maybe to the 50k traders mentally but the real shift happened with BitMEX losing market share and the new derivative exchanges using Tether as collateral vs. Bitcoin.
8063,2020-10-12 07:52:21+00:00,lawmaster,@udiWertheimer @CryptoMessiah @MagUraCrypto @alistairmilne @danheld You are definitely challenged

8068,2020-10-12 06:47:28+00:00,lawmaster,@nomos_paradox This is only for CEX. Dai is too small in CEX trading to even make the chart

8105,2020-10-09 05:09:04+00:00,lawmaster,@tbr90 @ChainLinkGod @CreamdotFinance Yea and then also make the cap more aggressive based on distribution of the float. If very distributed then it should be allowed to be higher vs. when a single party controls a large portion of the float
8106,2020-10-09 04:54:26+00:00,lawmaster,@interfluidity Yea basically. Which is why I think something like this won't be easy to fix given that a lot of the demand was bootstrapped by subsidies
8107,2020-10-09 04:48:54+00:00,lawmaster,"@interfluidity In short, market buyers got burned enough that they are no longer willing to subsidize yield. Lower yield means less opportunities and therefore less demand for block space."

8115,2020-10-08 19:12:10+00:00,lawmaster,@hasufl @Arthur_0x Question is whether regulators wouldn‚Äôt be much more agressive if DeFi did have built in privacy.

8322,2020-09-28 11:28:44+00:00,lawmaster,@StopAndDecrypt Yea because using a non-custodial non-censorable exchange and buying NFTs is exactly the same
8323,2020-09-28 10:45:25+00:00,lawmaster,"In the last two days, the hacker sold 320k OCEAN (worth $120k) until the contract was paused, then sold 578k SNX (worth $2.9M), then 10k COMP (worth $1.35M), then 203k LINK (worth $2.16M), and just recently started selling DIA. Only selling for ETH so far"

8328,2020-09-28 09:48:46+00:00,lawmaster,"@HsakaTrades Yea they did. But no chance it covers 100% right? And also based on my research, it‚Äôs not only hot wallets affected but a bunch of cold wallets too. Which makes me think it must have been done internally"
8329,2020-09-28 09:41:37+00:00,lawmaster,"Yes, some of these tokens have been frozen, forked, and blacklisted. And the amounts above don't reflect that.

8330,2020-09-28 09:41:37+00:00,lawmaster,"So I did some accounting of the KuCoin hack based on the wallets very likely associated and based on my estimation, there was nearly $280 million of assets stolen, not $150M.

IMO not EV+ gamble when you look at what happened to CryptoKitties and the fact that if it ever were to take off, Ethereum won‚Äôt be able to handle the load. And L2s for NFTs are super early"
8346,2020-09-28 04:42:20+00:00,lawmaster,@DegenSpartan @kaiynne If he went through all this trouble I‚Äôm sure he did. It was obvious to everyone that the price drop on something as liquid as SNX would correct fairly quickly. But you could make quite a bit of money on high leveraged 10% drop. Especially when you can time it perfectly
8347,2020-09-28 04:39:08+00:00,lawmaster,@kaiynne @DegenSpartan My theory is that the hacker is either just a dumbass or he purposely picked the less liquid market while simultaneously opening up a big short position on some CEX. That way you get people to panic and small increments of dumping will surely bring more attention than one dump
8348,2020-09-28 04:31:44+00:00,lawmaster,@alexgausman How would that work exactly? Reward buyers/sellers of CryptoPunks with $PUNK token and then hope enough people buy the token and provide liquidity for it?

8375,2020-09-27 08:46:59+00:00,lawmaster,@paoloardoino I think it would be silly if LP's assets become tainted. Most logical step is that the OCEAN he dumped is no longer tainted and the ETH he got now gets tainted. Hency why I don't consider it money laundering until some sort off mixing is involved.
8376,2020-09-27 08:44:14+00:00,lawmaster,"That being said, a high profile incident like this could bring Uniswap into regulators' spotlight. Especially if the swapping continues. Let's see"
8377,2020-09-27 08:40:45+00:00,lawmaster,"Also if you think this is laundering, it's not. He's getting ETH for shitcoins and the ETH will be tainted just as the shitcoin was prior to the swap. Laundering starts when Tornado or some shady OTC desk is involved. Confusing the two is not smart"
8378,2020-09-27 08:38:25+00:00,lawmaster,Watch this wallet closely if you want to see if he starts dumping some other shitcoin next. I don't really see why he'd stop at OCEAN https://t.co/ELHOxzoYem
8379,2020-09-27 08:37:25+00:00,lawmaster,"The hacker appeared to have stopped selling 20 minutes ago. He still has 90k OCEAN in one wallet. I think it's because the liquidity quickly dried up. In order to dump another 90k OCEAN on Uniswap, the price impact is 30%+. Might be smarter to wait until next dump https://t.co/OwhSjzyfDp"
8380,2020-09-27 08:26:20+00:00,lawmaster,@edwardmorra_btc He'd be dumb to dump to USD. It would have to be Dai I suppose and even then it's probably safer to have it in ETH itself
8381,2020-09-27 08:17:24+00:00,lawmaster,These are the ERC-20 tokens hacker has now sorted by USD value. Watching these closely as they can be next if Uniswap has liquid markets for some of them. Market participants might also front run then hacker and start dumping themselves. Some interesting dynamics playing out https://t.co/7iKB83buYm
8382,2020-09-27 08:13:24+00:00,lawmaster,The hacker is doing the same from this address as well. Dumping in 10k OCEAN batches https://t.co/rkE5gGIlgT
8383,2020-09-27 08:11:15+00:00,lawmaster,"All Uniswap transactions so far can be found here: https://t.co/y8AJWN5hw2

8388,2020-09-26 13:50:45+00:00,lawmaster,@Dogetoshi @loomdart You really need to read up on how BTC laundering works. You definitely won‚Äôt become a single easy target
8389,2020-09-26 13:46:41+00:00,lawmaster,@Dogetoshi @loomdart There are much simpler ways to launder money than through niche digital art where all outlier sales stick out like a sore thumb. You‚Äôre way overthinking this
8390,2020-09-26 13:43:56+00:00,lawmaster,"@Dogetoshi @loomdart Or maybe a new plan. Don‚Äôt be a complete idiot, swap all centralized tokens to decentralized on Uniswap, hold ETH and BTC, collect yield on both in DeFi (optional). Pay for one of the good darknet mixers for 30% of BTC. Then slowly start siphoning away ETH through Tornado"

8395,2020-09-26 08:46:08+00:00,lawmaster,@danielque @DoveyWan @CurveFinance @UniswapProtocol My point is that DeFi does not accomplish mixing. DeFi will allow you to swap to an asset that‚Äôs not centralized (like USDT) but then you have to still run it through Tornado to actual mix it. You see exactly what happens on chain and the taint just moves to the coin you get
8396,2020-09-26 08:13:30+00:00,lawmaster,@DoveyWan @CurveFinance @UniswapProtocol The only way is to then mix on Tornado Cash or wait for Ethereum to have better privacy.

8495,2020-09-22 07:57:52+00:00,lawmaster,@diaryrektman I bought at $33k just as a hedge that it keeps pumping. Arguably not the smartest move but hindsight is 20/20. Exited almost my entire crypto position to stablecoins ~4 days ago
8496,2020-09-22 07:56:08+00:00,lawmaster,Buying anything on Coinbase right after the listing after it's already been listed on Binance will almost certainly lose you money in the short term. Just something to keep in mind. It's the retail unload and sell the listing news
8497,2020-09-22 07:53:21+00:00,lawmaster,It's funny that pretty much everything Coinbase has listed recently has dumped hard ever since the listing. This is mainly because Coinbase is just way too slow to list things (vs. Uniswap and Binance) and it pumps before on the announcement. Then anyone who buys on CB gets REKT.
8498,2020-09-22 07:47:36+00:00,lawmaster,@sassal0x I‚Äôm playing as well but those tweets have become some very good counter indicators. Maybe a Set strategy?

8513,2020-09-22 04:29:00+00:00,lawmaster,I don‚Äôt think many of you realize how hard is it to create a liquid market for non-fungible tokens. That process alone and then also functioning in L2 with interoperability will take years to build out.
8514,2020-09-22 04:24:49+00:00,lawmaster,@RealAZKicks @DegenSpartan Exactly.
8515,2020-09-22 04:24:16+00:00,lawmaster,@NFT_Maximalist @DegenSpartan What are you accumulating exactly? I was accumulating NFT art more than a year ago because I thought it was cool. Literally no traction since and virtually nothing has changed
8516,2020-09-22 04:19:25+00:00,lawmaster,@RydesaurusRex @DegenSpartan It‚Äôs a VC driven narrative and plebs think it gives them a 100x chance since DeFi is now exhausted from these opps
8517,2020-09-22 04:16:57+00:00,lawmaster,"@DegenSpartan And I need to caveat this with the fact that I think NFTs do happen eventually. They fundamentally make sense but they won‚Äôt take off anytime soon. No interest, no great artists, bad trading experience, limited L2 interoperability. Ad none of you are NFT experts all of the sudden"
8518,2020-09-22 04:11:53+00:00,lawmaster,@cryptocody1 @DegenSpartan Trust me I won‚Äôt
8519,2020-09-22 04:10:30+00:00,lawmaster,@DegenSpartan I‚Äôve never seen a more forced narrative. First everyone sold the top and now they are eying NFT art? People need to realize that NFTs don‚Äôt take off without L2 and without 100s of thousands of people. Neither is happening anytime soon

8561,2020-09-20 07:33:37+00:00,lawmaster,"@PeterMcCormack If Uniswap wxisted on top of Bitcoin and you could trustlessly swap Bitcoin and Tether natively, would you change your mind?"
8562,2020-09-20 07:24:08+00:00,lawmaster,@MsHodl @blockreferral @sassal0x No I think that‚Äôs totally reasonable then. But you‚Äôre also not a journalist being paid to cover the cryptocurrency space fairly.
8563,2020-09-20 07:20:10+00:00,lawmaster,@MsHodl @blockreferral @sassal0x Good question to ask yourself is whether you‚Äôd be interested in this if it happened on top of Bitcoin and you could trustlessly swap Bitcoin for Tether.
8564,2020-09-20 07:15:32+00:00,lawmaster,"@udiWertheimer @MsHodl Well you can trustlessly swap ETH since it‚Äôs the native asset. Eventually, there will be better guarantees for wrapped Bitcoin as well. We‚Äôre not there yet but it will happen. Still the 2 BTC limit is still an issue for some and long term limits this high won‚Äôt last"
8565,2020-09-20 07:10:56+00:00,lawmaster,@udiWertheimer @MsHodl And you can swap USDC for Tether if you‚Äôd like. Sure still centralized but trustless swaps between Tether and wrapped Bitcoin is powerful as long as you trust WBTC as much as BTC on exchanges/Liquid.

8575,2020-09-20 05:55:27+00:00,lawmaster,"@gladstein @MsHodl Fiat on ramp will always be overregulated. Uniswap is for the ones that already have money in the system. Virtually all exchanges have KYC limits even for crypto/crypto or stablecoin/crypto. You can do the same for Tether, not just USDC"
8576,2020-09-20 05:49:46+00:00,lawmaster,I‚Äôm obviously just talking about people who are full time in the space - even more so the journalists. I don‚Äôt expect my parents to be actively using Uniswap but I absolutely expect journalists to at least try using it

8580,2020-09-20 05:36:01+00:00,lawmaster,@MsHodl No use in it to even try it once? It‚Äôs permissionless P2P swaps. Literally what we all wanted all along
8581,2020-09-20 05:33:19+00:00,lawmaster,"If you‚Äôve never used Uniswap at this point, you have to be deliberately avoiding it. And that just shows the bias might be a tad too strong there."

8617,2020-09-18 13:33:54+00:00,lawmaster,"@mewn21 Of course. Frankly, I am kinda surprised how that turned out. My assumption was that people would start to shill heavily post raise and a lot of demand would still be there as the sale was kinda under the radar still.

8620,2020-09-18 11:47:38+00:00,lawmaster,@stephendpalley Good morning friend ‚ù§Ô∏è
8621,2020-09-18 11:25:53+00:00,lawmaster,"@PenserETH @_Ed1990_ @bneiluj Relative to Sushi, it seems to be creating a strong community of supporters. Of course it might also go to shit but Curve‚Äôs distribution opened up the opportunity of something like this ever having a chance"
8622,2020-09-18 11:12:42+00:00,lawmaster,"@_Ed1990_ @bneiluj Of course it is. I love Curve, I just think they messed up the distribution so badly that it will be hard to come back from. Hence why Swerve is taking off and Sushiswap didn't"
8623,2020-09-18 11:08:54+00:00,lawmaster,@bneiluj Uniswap can afford a much more aggressive distribution than Curve. And Uniswap started at a really low price and has the potential to march higher with time. Curve started super high and now there is not much confidence in it. Price discovery taking months
8624,2020-09-18 11:07:12+00:00,lawmaster,"@bneiluj It's really not comparable. Uniswap introduced a much higher float through the airdrop, which means much faster price discover and UNI moves from weak hands to the ones that believe in it long term."
8625,2020-09-18 10:45:50+00:00,lawmaster,"@gggonecrypto @bneiluj It‚Äôs really not. Go to lobster chat, not gonna post everything here"
8626,2020-09-18 10:21:28+00:00,lawmaster,"@charlie_eth Also, the distribution mechanism and vesting schedules are very different. Not exactly comparable anyways. But more importantly I was right and you were wrong. So who cares"
8627,2020-09-18 10:20:21+00:00,lawmaster,"@charlie_eth When was I shilling it? You mean the tweet where I said the FD val is low compared to Balancer and Sushi? That‚Äôs a shill? Turns out I was right, price doubled since. Anything else?"
8628,2020-09-18 09:57:58+00:00,lawmaster,Price of CRV was $6.1 when I tweeted this. It's now down ~80% since and trading at $1.4. Keep in mind we've just been through incredible growth of nearly all DeFi tokens. And also look at the salty responses to spot the biggest bagholders.
8629,2020-09-18 09:20:46+00:00,lawmaster,@sassal0x @gitcoin Bingo
8630,2020-09-18 09:18:36+00:00,lawmaster,@sassal0x @gitcoin I hear ETH devs rightfully complaining about misaligned incentives and getting paid like shit while everyone else profits. Why?
8631,2020-09-18 09:15:30+00:00,lawmaster,When will exchanges/funds start sponsoring ETH core developers just like they fund Bitcoin devs? Massive goodwill and it‚Äôs virtually negligible cost
8632,2020-09-18 09:11:52+00:00,lawmaster,@mrjasonchoi @ASvanevik Agree. Counterargument is that LPs will try to stabilize the price in order to minimize IL. Don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs realistic thiugh
8633,2020-09-18 08:13:15+00:00,lawmaster,@Arthur_0x You complain about Dai not being whale friendly and think you could have bought some UNI at size around $1?? Smfh
8634,2020-09-18 08:02:17+00:00,lawmaster,@Arthur_0x Yoir consolation is that slippage was enormous and there wasn‚Äôt a lot to actually buy at that price
8635,2020-09-18 07:46:36+00:00,lawmaster,@edwardmorra_btc Yea have had this handle since 2008. And used this nickname since 2004. And my bio says I‚Äôm not a lawyer.
8636,2020-09-18 07:42:24+00:00,lawmaster,Read this thread. Mandatory. Now
8637,2020-09-18 07:18:41+00:00,lawmaster,Monetizing open source protocols is damn hard. Rentseeking rarely works. That‚Äôs why most open source is monetized through services and upselling the enterprise alternative
8638,2020-09-18 07:17:35+00:00,lawmaster,Really what everyone should be focusing on instead of regulatory concern trolling is how Uniswap can extract fees from the LPs and how that changes the dynamic. And if purely profit driven LPs don‚Äôt fork out the token and turn off the fees. Uniswap fees are still 0
8639,2020-09-18 07:01:38+00:00,lawmaster,I‚Äôm not a lawyer though and am sure this will be subtweeted by actual lawyers. So be it
8640,2020-09-18 06:59:38+00:00,lawmaster,@udiWertheimer Literally in the thread. Promises that could not be kept and company that relies on it
8641,2020-09-18 06:54:45+00:00,lawmaster,Have I become a sell out for wanting equity-like tokens of permissionless networks? Absolutely. What I hated about ICOs was raising from retail with promises that could not be kept. This is great
8642,2020-09-18 06:45:12+00:00,lawmaster,@udiWertheimer @mewn21 Sure it‚Äôs the same
8643,2020-09-18 06:43:27+00:00,lawmaster,@udiWertheimer Brosef EOS had a massive uncapped sale that was filled with promises that could not be kept. That was even before the bullshit network came online. You don‚Äôt see the difference?
8644,2020-09-18 06:40:19+00:00,lawmaster,"@mewn21 @udiWertheimer I‚Äôm saying it might happen and it will affect nothing. Price shock? Couldn‚Äôt care less, that‚Äôs up to the market to decide"
8645,2020-09-18 06:38:01+00:00,lawmaster,"If something is a security matters for something like XRP. Because the token is basically useless, will never have any revenue share and it‚Äôs just being used as revenue to fund a company that wouldn‚Äôt survive without it. World of difference"
8646,2020-09-18 06:35:11+00:00,lawmaster,@udiWertheimer I‚Äôm not giddy about anything. V2 is already deployed. V3 will be deployed before they wake up to do anything. After that who cares? These are deployed contracts that people are already using
8647,2020-09-18 06:33:02+00:00,lawmaster,@udiWertheimer What can the SEC do? Enlighten me pls
8648,2020-09-18 06:31:45+00:00,lawmaster,Everyone but accredited investors got the token at $0? Who exactly is being harmed by the price discovery on the secondary markets? Most the SEC could likely accomplish is delisting UNI from U.S. exchanges and potentially a fine. GG on doing anything else
8649,2020-09-18 06:29:39+00:00,lawmaster,"I am loving these ‚Äúthis is a clear security‚Äù takes. An important part here is enforcement. Even if it was a security, what exactly do you think gets accomplished here? UNI token keeps going brrrr and keeps getting traded on Uniswap, which doesn‚Äôt answer to nobody - it‚Äôs deployed."
8650,2020-09-18 06:24:00+00:00,lawmaster,@DegenSpartan Wonder how exactly he envisions that happens. Most the SEC can accomplish is to go after the founders and it would lead nowhere. Maybe it could also affect the UNI distribution to founders/VCs but Uniswap will keep trucking regardless. Halting LMAO
8651,2020-09-18 05:06:19+00:00,lawmaster,@alexgausman @finesseboi_eth Meme I think
8652,2020-09-18 04:50:37+00:00,lawmaster,"@MikeMcDonald89 @paoloardoino @NomiChef That was no my point at all. It was not his Tether to begin with, it got sent to his contract by accident by someone else. And Nomi doesn‚Äôt have the keys to the wallet anymore, which is irrelevant anyway"
8653,2020-09-17 20:30:53+00:00,lawmaster,@fintechfrank @AndreCronjeTech The Lakers would continue without LeBron as well but the question is with how much success.
8654,2020-09-17 20:25:49+00:00,lawmaster,"@paoloardoino @NomiChef TL;DR he forked Uniswap, added a token, bootstrapped a massive community, got the token listed on Binance, token pumped, then it started dumping as hype went down, Nomi panicked, market sold $14M of his tokens and then returned the money two weeks later and disappeared"
8655,2020-09-17 20:21:37+00:00,lawmaster,@paoloardoino @NomiChef I feel like you need to get caught up on what happened to Nomi
8656,2020-09-17 18:33:46+00:00,lawmaster,"@iam__vance @Fiskantes Yep, this is exactly right. Yet everyone does it"
8657,2020-09-17 16:05:31+00:00,lawmaster,"If UNI ever goes to $11, which is not totally unreasonable, Paradigm's &lt;$5 million investment could be worth more than a billion. I remember some people laughed at Paradigm for funding Uniswap in early 2019. Crazy"
8658,2020-09-17 16:05:31+00:00,lawmaster,So 178 million UNI is going to investors (with 4y vesting). Paradigm was the only fund in the seed round and got 17% of Uniswap's equity. Then they also participated in the Series A. Overall they likely got close to 50% of the investor allocation.
8659,2020-09-17 10:03:57+00:00,lawmaster,"@DaanCrypto Long term massive potential but unclear value capture, short term I will be watching for a bit and let the dust settle."
8660,2020-09-17 09:59:26+00:00,lawmaster,@iwearahoodie @C1aranMurray Because you need to capture the fees. Only LPs make money now. There is still no guarantee that LPs stick if/when rentseeking is introduced
8661,2020-09-17 09:57:20+00:00,lawmaster,@iwearahoodie @C1aranMurray No. 100% not
8662,2020-09-17 09:54:39+00:00,lawmaster,"@C1aranMurray If Uniswap can execute, successfully persuade LPs that rent seeking is ok and if the volumes sustain in these ranges, it‚Äôs clearly very low."
8663,2020-09-17 09:52:18+00:00,lawmaster,@SBF_Alameda I don‚Äôt know. I think the market is pricing the chance of Sushi succeeding very low after the UNI drop. So there will surely be some opportunities that don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs over yet
8664,2020-09-17 09:49:11+00:00,lawmaster,"@SBF_Alameda I think it‚Äôs too early to look at comparative metrics. The way investors should view it is whether the volume is sustainable. It makes sense that Uniswap has a stronger brand, longer history and therefore likely more sustainable volume. Sushi still has to prove itself"
8665,2020-09-17 09:43:42+00:00,lawmaster,I have no idea where this will all go. All I know is that Uniswap has the best P/M fit and the most actual users. The other side is thar there isn‚Äôt even a guarantee of value capture. And we still have no clue whatsoever what Uni v3 even looks like.
8666,2020-09-17 09:41:02+00:00,lawmaster,"Many people don‚Äôt realize that a lot of crypto investors are not here for the long haul. They invest on a short term horizon and whenever you can cash out something you were given for free or at an absurdly low price, a lot will take the chance. Keep that in mind"
8667,2020-09-17 09:38:04+00:00,lawmaster,"FD valuation and market cap for UNI is absurdly low right now, especially when you start comparing to Balancer/SUSHI, but don‚Äôt underestimate the short term sell pressure of all the people that were airdropped life changing amounts of money. Unvested airdrops tend to be sold."

8850,2020-09-10 05:56:00+00:00,lawmaster,If you want to swap ETH for USDT and SushiSwap has less slippage (you get more USDT) than Uniswap but you despise SushiSwap. Do you go for less slippage on SushiSwap or you‚Äôd rather trade on Uniswap for ideological reasons?
8851,2020-09-10 05:45:19+00:00,lawmaster,"@IslandHunting Because long tail gets added where users are. If volume starts flooding to sushiswap for the majors and you gotta go there for swapping that, you might as well also trade long tail there. Again this will likely not happen but it‚Äôs quite possible"
8852,2020-09-10 05:39:00+00:00,lawmaster,"@IslandHunting That could easily change. All that matters for now is retaining LPs, providing less slippage for users and then ultimately getting more volume. If all of this happens, long tail would be added to sushiswap as well. Low chance but majority of volume is coming from the majors"

8866,2020-09-09 20:40:37+00:00,lawmaster,@IslandHunting Oh that's 100% correct. Main reason is that it just migrated though and it will take a while for LPs to provide liquidity for long tail assets.
8867,2020-09-09 20:36:56+00:00,lawmaster,"I hope Uniswap wins for the sake of the space. If it loses, it will disincentivize developers to try to come up with rent-seeking open-source models, and development could slow down.

8871,2020-09-09 20:16:45+00:00,lawmaster,Take both of these with a grain of salt as it's literally just screenshots of which gave a better price. What will matter long term is whether SushiSwap can retain LPs with a rent-seeking model and which protocol captures larger volumes in the coming weeks.

9155,2020-08-31 05:28:40+00:00,lawmaster,@ChainLinkGod Yea it‚Äôs inevitable. What LPs don‚Äôt know though is if the distribution will be retrospective. A single announcement can help retain some liquidity that would otherwise switch to Sushi
9156,2020-08-31 05:25:23+00:00,lawmaster,@josusanmartin Yea obviously. But the dark scenario for Uniswap is that SushiSwap has more liquidity when the migration is over. Presumably a lot of LPs will just stop LPing when it‚Äôs all done

9256,2020-08-25 10:42:12+00:00,lawmaster,@hasufl The point doesn‚Äôt hold. The design is clearly different from LEO and inferior because it doesn‚Äôt create constant buy pressure. There is some BNB buy pressure from traders that want discounts but it‚Äôs not predictable and you can‚Äôt ever know how much
9257,2020-08-25 10:39:05+00:00,lawmaster,@ercwl @hasufl @austerity_sucks @crypto_delboy And most of the traders that want fee discounts buy way in advance and hold a lot of it. It doesn‚Äôt create constant buy pressure
9258,2020-08-25 10:36:54+00:00,lawmaster,@ercwl @hasufl @austerity_sucks @crypto_delboy Exactly
9259,2020-08-25 10:31:02+00:00,lawmaster,"@hasufl You example somehow assumes that all fees are paid in BNB, which is definitely not the case"
9260,2020-08-25 10:29:37+00:00,lawmaster,@hasufl There is no data to show how much do Binance users pay for fees in BNB. It could be a lot but could also be very little.
9261,2020-08-25 10:27:20+00:00,lawmaster,@hasufl But Binance doesn‚Äôt require users to pay fees in BNB so it‚Äôs not indicative of performance as much as buying back based on revenue. That‚Äôs still a big difference and constant buy pressure on LEO shows when everything else tanks

9288,2020-08-23 11:11:31+00:00,lawmaster,@AndreCronjeTech Like you point out there are two key differences. Lack of UNI token + YFI already had fair distribution. I think the main reason why Uniswap fork won‚Äôt be pulled off is that there is a high likelihood of being shunned by the community itself. And LT it‚Äôs about sustainable volume
9289,2020-08-23 10:51:35+00:00,lawmaster,"@ConvexMonster @AndreCronjeTech Yes and like Andre points out, the lack of token is huge. Market is super hungry for Uniswap‚Äôs token"

9291,2020-08-23 10:29:10+00:00,lawmaster,@hasufl @AndreCronjeTech I think so too. Might push the Uniswap team to release the token slightly faster
9292,2020-08-23 10:27:45+00:00,lawmaster,I guess something similar is currently happening with Mooniswap except the token distribution itself is trash.
9293,2020-08-23 10:26:17+00:00,lawmaster,"I can only imagine that if someone pulled this off and also got some funding (from that 10% of supply) to hire a team, it would be very hard for Uniswap to do anything.

9407,2020-08-17 11:45:52+00:00,lawmaster,@ProofofMilan Of course it is. But it‚Äôs a hint of what‚Äôs to come when protocols behave more similarly to equity and valuations depend more so on revenue vs. hype

9413,2020-08-17 11:16:47+00:00,lawmaster,One of the more exciting consequences of the emergence of equity-like DeFi tokens is that it will eventually be possible to diversify crypto holdings.

9514,2020-08-12 20:45:37+00:00,lawmaster,@LefterisJP @econoar Because VCs wrote a check and got a price of AMPL that no one else had access to. Early farmers at least had the same information and no preferential treatment.

9577,2020-08-09 20:18:08+00:00,lawmaster,@intocryptoast @CamiRusso @TheStalwart My main issue is with encouraging normies to withdraw their money from their Wealthfront/Marcus accounts and make them put it in high yield stablecoin accounts.

9582,2020-08-09 19:51:34+00:00,lawmaster,@dopamine_uptake @TheStalwart None of that is figured out and I‚Äôm quite skeptical as well. I think undercollateralized lending is much closer and actually somewhat feasible

9584,2020-08-09 19:41:40+00:00,lawmaster,@TheStalwart Everything is used in trading one way or another. Prediction markets are quite promosi g although that‚Äôs technically trading as well.

9686,2020-08-03 10:27:02+00:00,lawmaster,@danclarkie @KenrickLuneX @jonrussell @cryptocom @Kris_HK The issue is that you own a much smaller share of the overall CRO supply than you used to own of MCO.

9690,2020-08-03 08:18:38+00:00,lawmaster,@danclarkie @DegenSpartan For how long? Everyone who used to own MCO gets grandfathered forever?
9691,2020-08-03 07:58:04+00:00,lawmaster,This is not a positive development for the MCO holders. Product is getting more expensive and they now hold a lot less of the ecosystem than they used to. That's what eventually happens to companies that have two tokens and it's at the expense of early holders.
9692,2020-08-03 07:55:57+00:00,lawmaster,"The bottom tier used to be 50 MCO staked, which was ~$200 before the pump. Now it's priced at 5,000 CRO, which is ~$850. So all tiers basically got 4x more expensive. What investors should also realize is that their MCO holdings got significantly diluted when they swap to CRO"
9693,2020-08-03 07:37:11+00:00,lawmaster,"@franticnews @DegenSpartan Reason for the pump is that MCO is now essentially pegged to CRO. And since they said they'd payout 20% extra for the swap, people immediately arbed it away and MCO went up"

9784,2020-07-27 08:21:26+00:00,lawmaster,@Lindw0rm Obviously. Just yesterday I got this error four times before a simple sell went through. Because the price was moving fast and gas prices were high https://t.co/GpFGLjm7Fz
9785,2020-07-27 08:18:26+00:00,lawmaster,The first version of the DEX is going to be launched in a couple of weeks. So I guess we will see then.
9786,2020-07-27 08:14:47+00:00,lawmaster,Is this the right solution? And will it be better than building something like this on L2? I have no idea. Mainly it will depend on how seamless the experience is and how elegantly the interoperability works.
9787,2020-07-27 08:13:01+00:00,lawmaster,I personally tend to think that there is still a massive gap on the market for non-custodial exchanges. Everyone that's tried to buy a volatile asset on Uniswap knows that the experience is not great - expensive and too slow. Execution needs to be faster and still non-custodial
9788,2020-07-27 08:09:00+00:00,lawmaster,Lack of interoperability is an obvious reason for why Binance DEX hasn't gained any traction whatsoever. No one wants to use Binance Chain and swapping to compatible tokens is a pain in the ass. Remains to be seen how this DEX handles interoperability in practice though

The odds are that there are many such exploits or compromisable employees out there and hackers will always find a way to your data. Use encrypted channels to communicate

10019,2020-07-12 05:12:47+00:00,lawmaster,Coinbase should also address which Neutrino members were cycled out and when. No transparency there whatsoever https://t.co/EFY1QAZ6AT
10020,2020-07-12 05:10:19+00:00,lawmaster,Coinbase could only use this tool internally. Or at the very least only use the software for compliance use case vs. investigation use case. And @brian_armstrong should address whether Coinbase is giving away perfect clusters.
10021,2020-07-12 05:10:18+00:00,lawmaster,Coinbase likely makes that much in a couple of hours just from trading fees. What‚Äôs a much more credible explanation is the relationships with government agencies - especially as Coinbase is preparing to go public soon. The cost is basically a lobbying budget.
10022,2020-07-12 05:10:18+00:00,lawmaster,The recouping money argument... The government agencies said themselves that ‚Äúthis is the least expensive tool on the market and has the most features for the money.‚Äù Coinbase is undercutting competitors‚Äô prices by a lot. The 4Y contract to Secret Service is only worth $184k.
10023,2020-07-12 05:10:01+00:00,lawmaster,"Remember that in 2018, Coinbase served client data of 13,000 users to the IRS. When you combine client data exports with perfect knowledge of the cluster, it creates a new (dangerous) dynamic."
10024,2020-07-12 05:10:00+00:00,lawmaster,The issue this creates is that it can be relatively hard for law enforcement to use data from other blockchain analysis companies to prosecute somebody as their only evidence. Because the data is probabilistic.
10025,2020-07-12 05:10:00+00:00,lawmaster,What‚Äôs still not clear is whether Coinbase is giving government agencies access to the full cluster of all of their addresses. Coinbase has always had a notoriously difficult set of addresses to cluster. That data is only ever probabilistic unless you are Coinbase.
10026,2020-07-12 05:10:00+00:00,lawmaster,"Coinbase acquired Neutrino in early 2019, which was essentially a spyware company that sold products to countries known for human rights abuses. Brian says this ‚Äúdid not go very well‚Äù and that Coinbase had to cycle out some team members."
10027,2020-07-12 05:09:59+00:00,lawmaster,Brian argues that Coinbase sells blockchain analysis to government agencies to recoup costs (after acquiring Neutrino for $13.5M) and to build better relationships with law enforcement.

10358,2020-06-20 21:24:37+00:00,lawmaster,@CasPiancey I‚Äôm not sure you understand still. There is massive demand for borrowing Tether for those traders that go leverage long on their positions. It‚Äôs not comparable to the bank in any way
10359,2020-06-20 21:18:24+00:00,lawmaster,@OguzSerdar @basedkarbon @CasPiancey Trans mining incentivized wash trading. This incentivizes providing liquidity for lemding. Not really that comparable

High APY is just the result of demand for going lev long or shorting and also subsidies. The yield will go down long term
10367,2020-06-20 20:48:25+00:00,lawmaster,@CasPiancey @xGozzy @AndoniOlta That‚Äôs literally just supply/demand. That‚Äôs not shady in any way

10371,2020-06-20 16:31:41+00:00,lawmaster,@CasPiancey Celsius is the definition of opaque. It takes users funds and tries to maximize yield in any way they can.

10595,2020-06-05 20:20:28+00:00,lawmaster,It is surprising they are going after the government's money for investigations rather than after exchange compliance. This could mean they are doing it for law enforcement relationships. But I'm not sure it will be worth it given that customers won't be happy about that.
10596,2020-06-05 20:20:28+00:00,lawmaster,I don't exactly understand why this would be worth it for Coinbase since they are already making tens of millions a year just from the trading fees. There is a clear conflict of interest since Coinbase has access to all the customers' KYC documents unlike someone like Chainalysis

10791,2020-05-25 16:32:58+00:00,lawmaster,@SBF_Alameda The point was that it dropped significantly up until 4-5 days ago. As much as 30% since pre-halving.

1. liquidity (order book depth, spread analysis)
2. web traffic estimates

11035,2020-05-14 19:08:35+00:00,lawmaster,"@ASvanevik No but it holds a shit ton of Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin. AFAIK way more than any other exchange and it's not even close"

11037,2020-05-14 19:05:48+00:00,lawmaster,"@ASvanevik The issue with this approach is that Coinbase should be first and isn't. Because their wallet system hasn't really been cracked yet, no one knows how to estimate their holdings."

11051,2020-05-14 11:34:09+00:00,lawmaster,@hackerrdave @La__Cuen That is true. Charts can be biased as well but it's much easier to tell when they are. I'm not saying that using data automatically makes something objective

11054,2020-05-14 11:25:50+00:00,lawmaster,@TorBair @La__Cuen And? Bitcoin was still correlated 2 months ago. In fact it was hitting peak correlation then. What‚Äôs your point?

11122,2020-05-10 10:34:44+00:00,lawmaster,@ASvanevik In short - Bitfinex is the best exchange for large traders that need liquidity and a great matching engine. It treats its customers really well. Binance is retail driven and doesn‚Äôt treat its customers like it should. But it‚Äôs cheap and relatively liquid - especially for alts
11123,2020-05-10 10:31:53+00:00,lawmaster,"@ASvanevik Binance, on the other hand, is not run well. Internally it‚Äôs a huge mess and treats its customers like shit while claiming otherwise. But it‚Äôs the fastest growing and quick to add features. But retail bucketshop"
11124,2020-05-10 10:30:22+00:00,lawmaster,"@ASvanevik Likely skewed. Bitfinex is losing a lot of market share recently and constantly has issues with regulators and banking partners. On top of that, as Tether soon gets to 10B, it will attract even more attention from regulators. But it‚Äôs the most liquid exchange and best for traders"
11125,2020-05-10 10:23:49+00:00,lawmaster,"That‚Äôs what I would expect from these quasi securities - not dumping even more like BNB and most of others. If I recall correctly, FTT also performs slightly better than other exchange tokens"
11126,2020-05-10 10:22:50+00:00,lawmaster,Not gonna lie it‚Äôs kinda impressive how LEO is pretty much the only fairly liquid token that doesn‚Äôt dump in large market drawbacks. The fact that it‚Äôs not correlated in these environments is likely caused by Bitfinex actually buying back on the open market every 3 hours.

11183,2020-05-07 18:35:14+00:00,lawmaster,@SBF_Alameda @CasPiancey This is my theory https://t.co/aNuUEeQZq5
11184,2020-05-07 18:32:45+00:00,lawmaster,"@CasPiancey I think the main reason for this phenomenon is that transacting Omni USDT wasn‚Äôt super intuitive. So people learned to convert to BTC, send to fiat off ramp and dump it there. Now that USDT is mostly on Ethereum, I expect this trend to slowly fade away as it‚Äôs much easier"
11185,2020-05-07 18:30:21+00:00,lawmaster,"@KyleSGibson @CasPiancey So what do you think people with USDT do? You think they can‚Äôt redeem or something? Like what‚Äôs the theory here, I‚Äôd love to hear it"

11187,2020-05-07 18:27:20+00:00,lawmaster,@KyleSGibson @CasPiancey Yea that is at least significant to a degree. This isn‚Äôt
11188,2020-05-07 18:24:06+00:00,lawmaster,@CasPiancey That‚Äôs because people convert to BTC and then sell that for USD. The fact that USD/USDT pairs have low volume means nothing
11189,2020-05-07 17:41:34+00:00,lawmaster,"If you think about it, it‚Äôs not super easy to get exposure at that size. I doubt he bought spot, definitely not GBTC with its premium and there is no ETF. So CME seem like the likeliest option. What‚Äôs interesting is that we might be able to tell from the weekly CFTC report"
11190,2020-05-07 17:37:58+00:00,lawmaster,CME open interest grew significantly despite all other futures products staying relatively put. That and also volumes are really low. This could indicate that a massive trader has gotten exposure. It‚Äôs definitely possible that it was Paul Tudor who bumped OI like this

11407,2020-04-19 15:37:44+00:00,lawmaster,@patrick_0l Yep. The deciding factor here is 1. deal to not press charges 2. jurisdiction of the ‚Äúattacker‚Äù 3. time preference

11409,2020-04-19 15:36:24+00:00,lawmaster,@Rob_Daykin If it ensured no criminal charges then I think any robber would take that deal. But comparing the dForce ‚Äúattacker‚Äù to a bank robber is not accurate
11410,2020-04-19 15:34:54+00:00,lawmaster,@theDAOKING @CryptoGodfatha That‚Äôs exactly the point of my question. But it does depend a lot on which country the person is from

11436,2020-04-18 07:41:09+00:00,lawmaster,@richardraizes @sobradob All of these combined are less than 5% of total revenue. Likely much less
11437,2020-04-18 07:32:08+00:00,lawmaster,@richardraizes @sobradob That‚Äôs only true if you assume majority of volume isn‚Äôt coming from market makers that are paying nearly no fees. Definitely the lowest tier if not lower. These fees are negotiated per client
11438,2020-04-18 07:26:18+00:00,lawmaster,@richardraizes @sobradob A lot of the volume on Binance‚Äôs spot exchange is meaningless market maker volume. I think at least 50% but likely much much more
11439,2020-04-18 07:25:31+00:00,lawmaster,"@richardraizes @sobradob It‚Äôs nowhere close to #1 futures market. BitMEX and OKEx are many times higher. And very questionable on #1 for spot market.

11440,2020-04-18 06:02:02+00:00,lawmaster,@sobradob That would mean Binance generated $262.33 million in profit this quarter. Does that sound realistic?

11447,2020-04-18 05:18:06+00:00,lawmaster,"14/ Binance constantly tries to push that it is a transparent exchange. Yet, in my experience, it's one of the least transparent exchanges with a CEO that will instantly block people that say something he doesn't like. Even the employees are often in the dark of what‚Äôs going on"
11448,2020-04-18 05:06:53+00:00,lawmaster,"13/ This can be nicely seen from the ratio between spot volume and burn, which has declined significantly from last quarter and on par with 3Q19. That is very counterintuitive because futures volume was also up from last Q so if anything, the ratio should have increased https://t.co/bUUV9ELreb"
11449,2020-04-18 04:59:17+00:00,lawmaster,"12/ I used my model and estimated the burn to be 4.3M BNB. But Binance uses an undisclosed formula ""based on volume"" and can burn anything it wants. If the burns were proportional to volume, retrofitted by last quarter, Binance would have to burn more.

11451,2020-04-18 04:49:24+00:00,lawmaster,"10/ Binance has also started to bring in a significant amount of revenue from its margin trading product. However, the exchange has yet to release any data on how much it's been lending out or how much it earns in interest."

11457,2020-04-18 04:45:44+00:00,lawmaster,"4/ The issue with these two things is that Binance can basically choose any number of BNB they want because basing something on traded volume is super ambiguous. We don't know the formula and we will never know. On top of that, they are just burning uncirculated supply"
11458,2020-04-18 04:43:45+00:00,lawmaster,"3/ Another reason, and few people still know about this, is that Binance no longer burns based on profit like promised in the original whitepaper.

11459,2020-04-18 04:41:59+00:00,lawmaster,"2/ Why not as significant - two things. The main one is that unlike some other tokens (like LEO), Binance doesn't buy and burn on the open market but rather burns uncirculated supply that it already has in its own treasury. They are burning something they created themselves"
11460,2020-04-18 04:40:07+00:00,lawmaster,1/ Binance has just finished its 11th burned and has now cumulatively burned more than 10% of BNB's supply.

There are about 400 total players in the NBA and probably not even 50% of them were tested. As much as 5% of all NBA players could have the virus but showed very mild or no symptons

11824,2020-03-19 07:02:22+00:00,lawmaster,@rezendi Just look at the random assymptomatic NBA players getting tested. There are 480 players overall and I think 9-10 already tested positive. And I‚Äôd guess only 50% of total players got tested. They travel a lot more and are def more exposed but still
11825,2020-03-19 06:55:13+00:00,lawmaster,@rezendi I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it‚Äôs more than 1%

12279,2020-02-17 10:28:19+00:00,lawmaster,I think this is a really interesting case precisely because it doesn't really have precedent. And it will be interesting how this will be treated by the blockchain analysis cos. Should the attacker be allowed to cash out on an exchange? I think yes but not sure if they will agree

‚Ä¢ the attacker made ~$350k in profit but bZx lost ~$620k in equity (later arbed away on Uniswap)
‚Ä¢ it wasn‚Äôt an oracle bug but rather a logic bug in bZx that caused it to trade on Uniswap at a 3x price"

12373,2020-02-11 20:17:28+00:00,lawmaster,Article here https://t.co/Sfwo8KkZdA
12374,2020-02-11 20:12:34+00:00,lawmaster,The only reasonable explanation that would make sense to me is that investors simply wanted to give Blockstack the money regardless. So investors on the board voted in their favor regardless of what the original definitions were. I can't come up with any other explanation
12375,2020-02-11 20:09:32+00:00,lawmaster,"In short, I believe that Blockstack owns everyone an explanation. The definition that it filed with the SEC doesn't seem to correspond to what actually happened. It might also be time to ask the board how they arrived at their conclusion. We tried but with no responses."
12376,2020-02-11 20:07:20+00:00,lawmaster,".@muneeb himself pointed out: ‚Äúthe privacy focus of our network makes it nearly impossible to measure active users, so by design, there is no way to collect activity data.‚Äù If that was true, why set such a goal at all? Why registered users since day one?"
12377,2020-02-11 20:05:25+00:00,lawmaster,"Following the pushback on the 1M user announcement, Blockstack released a blog post. But it focused on ‚Äúusername registrations‚Äù versus the term ‚Äúverified users‚Äù as it existed in the original post, as well as the SEC filing that outlined the milestone. https://t.co/wGtl4Tfd8o"
12378,2020-02-11 20:03:05+00:00,lawmaster,"Further ‚Äì and these are, perhaps, more subjective queries ‚Äì should the people who were airdropped STX tokens even be counted as verified users? Are they a ‚Äúuser‚Äù given that the traditional definition of that term is ‚Äúone who uses‚Äù? STX tokens won't be unlocked until 2021 anyway"
12379,2020-02-11 20:02:12+00:00,lawmaster,"But where did other 700k supposedly verified users come from? Especially in such a short period of time? I have literally no idea. Yet the independent advisory board somehow determined that under the pre-set guidelines, Blockstack met these requirements https://t.co/qcE3Hkh6pv"
12380,2020-02-11 19:59:50+00:00,lawmaster,So where did the one million verified users come from? A little over 300k+ supposedly came from Blockain's airdrop. It‚Äôs worth noting that https://t.co/rkIWAmvljo was compensated for the airdrop and the total payment was dependent on the number of verified users that received it.
12381,2020-02-11 19:58:33+00:00,lawmaster,"According to data, there were 156k total usernames by Nov 6, 504k by Dec 8 and 1.97 million usernames by Jan 29. That means that from Dec 8 until Jan 29 (~50 days), Blockstack supposedly added nearly 1.5 million usernames and at least 50% of them would have pass verification"
12382,2020-02-11 19:56:17+00:00,lawmaster,"How did Blockstack define verified users? In the filing with the SEC, it said a user is verified if they either confirm their phone number, verify their social media or pass KYC. https://t.co/QpJFmHNHH8 https://t.co/OGxZNk1y4V"

12644,2020-01-21 09:29:34+00:00,lawmaster,"All exchanges struggled in Q4, Binance is not the exception. No matter how much of BNB they are burning. Binance is still a massively successful business but it's simply not as successful as they would lead you to believe. Do your own research"
12645,2020-01-21 09:26:47+00:00,lawmaster,"My theory is that Binance is just burning more BNB because they already have it in treasury anyway (why not?) and if they burn more, it gives them more headlines and the appearance that Q4 was really successful. Which, if you look at all the data, just can't be possible"
12646,2020-01-21 09:24:44+00:00,lawmaster,So to say that the reason that the ratio is increasing is because they are generating more money from Futures also doesn't make much sense. Spot trading likely still makes 80%+ of Binance's revenues. There is simply no way that Binance generated more profit in Q4 than in Q2
12647,2020-01-21 09:19:18+00:00,lawmaster,"It makes virtually no sense to compare spot volume and futures volume... Futures offer highly leveraged trading, which is manifested in the volume. On top of that, fees are about 3-4x lower on Binance Futures than on spot.

12648,2020-01-21 09:17:02+00:00,lawmaster,"In Q2, for example, Binance burned $23.84 million while recording traded volume $151.70 billion. In Q4, Binance's volume decreased by 47% while the burn increased by more than 60%. This is nicely demonstrated in the ratio between the burn and traded volume. https://t.co/h3y7RO2Xpi"
12649,2020-01-21 09:16:17+00:00,lawmaster,The USD amount of the Q4 burn was the second-highest ever recorded after Q4 2017. Binance's Q4 burn is interesting because the increase doesn't correspond to the decrease in traded volume. https://t.co/015Lu52Hiq

12775,2020-01-13 09:27:54+00:00,lawmaster,11/ But he keeps his eyes on a much bigger prize than a Reg D tokenized bond. His vision continues to be to create a new asset class and this is just a proof of concept. The first step will be to have a Reg A offering as well in order to allow non-accredited investors.
12776,2020-01-13 09:27:32+00:00,lawmaster,"10/ Dinwiddie has been a bitcoin investor for quite some time. He bought his first bitcoin in the summer of 2017 when the price was less than $4,000.

12777,2020-01-13 09:27:08+00:00,lawmaster,"9/ On top of the bond aspect, if Dinwiddie makes it to the All-Star game and his tokenized bond if fulfilled, he promised to take eight of the investors with him as part of the token holder experience.

12780,2020-01-13 09:26:34+00:00,lawmaster,"6/ NBA didn‚Äôt like this idea though, specifically the involvement of the player option. They said it would have been gambling. The NBA hired a big time law firm and threatened that Dinwiddie‚Äôs contract would be terminated if he continued without approval."
12781,2020-01-13 09:26:22+00:00,lawmaster,5/ This could have been a massive asset class but it could have also introduced some complexities. Could players trade their own token? Could it even be stopped? Could they buy back their token if they thought it was undervalued?
12782,2020-01-13 09:26:13+00:00,lawmaster,4/ This could have effectively led to the creation of real fantasy sports. Investors could bet based on the upside of the last year and player‚Äôs value could freely trade on the open market based on how the player performed. It would tie the price to performance.
12783,2020-01-13 09:25:55+00:00,lawmaster,"3/ Most of the upside came from the player option. If Dinwiddie opted out of his third year in 2021 and negotiated a more lucrative contract with his or another team, investors would collect the difference between the original contract and the new one."
12784,2020-01-13 09:25:46+00:00,lawmaster,"2/ Spencer‚Äôs original design, which was quite brilliant IMO, was to tokenize roughly 40% of his $34.4 million 3-year contract, which included potential bonuses (for example for making playoffs) as well as a player option for his third year."

13479,2019-12-03 02:14:53+00:00,lawmaster,@zooko There is absolutely enough information to say that he made a massive mistake but that he didn‚Äôt act in bad faith. His side of the story isn‚Äôt going to change that. What was cringy though is the lack of education about North Korea

13481,2019-12-02 16:24:09+00:00,lawmaster,@WayneVaughan I also think that Binance is obeying much less than Huobi and OKEx. It‚Äôs entirely possible that the government is requiring some data sharing and Binance refused to cooperate.
13482,2019-12-02 16:22:07+00:00,lawmaster,@WayneVaughan Hard to speculate. My guess would be that Huobi and OKEx founders are both Chinese citizens and easier to keep tabs on. I think that Huobi and OKEx also have much closer relationships with the government
13483,2019-12-02 16:17:32+00:00,lawmaster,Binance getting pushed out of China while Huobi and OKEx are allowed to operate is the story to watch right now. No matter what certain executives would have you believe

13502,2019-12-02 01:00:23+00:00,lawmaster,"@UDIWERTHEIMER @Dogetoshi Yea, USDT and Dai could have around 10% but no one is using GUSD. And I‚Äôm not aware of any large lending markets that support GUSD"
13503,2019-12-02 00:55:38+00:00,lawmaster,@Dogetoshi Pretty sure these rates are subsidized by VC money. Not really sure how else they could be getting these rates

13508,2019-12-01 19:48:49+00:00,lawmaster,@jgarzik I don‚Äôt agree with the sanctions either. There is plenty of research now to show how ineffective they‚Äôve been. But how do blockchains solve any of this? 99.9% of all people in NK don‚Äôt even know what internet is
13509,2019-12-01 19:45:16+00:00,lawmaster,@bucketsss76 @jgarzik He is a complete idiot
13510,2019-12-01 19:42:43+00:00,lawmaster,@jgarzik There is also a huge difference between a diplomat negotiating mutually beneficial policy and a loose cannon researcher speaking to party members on NK about financial freedom through blockchain after being denied entry.
13511,2019-12-01 19:40:07+00:00,lawmaster,@jgarzik There is a reason why North Korea and the United States have no formal diplomatic relations

13536,2019-12-01 10:08:45+00:00,lawmaster,@SelectaCrypto @antiprosynth Maybe there shouldn‚Äôt be then? Because now the EF will actually feel the consequences. They were nearly in every headline about this

13737,2019-11-16 10:48:07+00:00,lawmaster,"@KyleSamani Urbit covers a much larger scope than Blockstack. On top of that, Blockstack incentivizes the creation of new apps by paying out monetary rewards. Every 30 days, it pays $200k to the apps that are voted the best. This leads to more apps but also some apps abuse the system"
13738,2019-11-16 10:43:29+00:00,lawmaster,@KyleSamani If I were to really simplify - Blockstack is giving users ownership of data that they use to interact with different applications.

14147,2019-10-16 15:34:44+00:00,lawmaster,@jpurd17 Sorry for not making the thread a little bit clearer for you
14148,2019-10-16 15:24:41+00:00,lawmaster,"@jasonklau @OKEx @binance Yep, I mention that in the full article. That OKEx has higher BTC return and also sustains value better than Binance"
14149,2019-10-16 15:22:27+00:00,lawmaster,"@jpurd17 As soon as the easy profits are no longer to be made, IEOs will die off just like ICOs. People will only invest until there are profits to be made and very few actually care about the useless tokens. When demand goes down, exchanges will no longer expose themselves to more risk"
14150,2019-10-16 15:19:20+00:00,lawmaster,@jpurd17 Way to take my tweets out of context though
14151,2019-10-16 15:18:35+00:00,lawmaster,"@jpurd17 Backing early-stage companies has to be about incentivizing founders to build something meaningful. Not about incentivizing retail investors that don't even know what the product is in some cases to buy at presale and flip later. None of the IEOs hold value, that's the problem."
14152,2019-10-16 15:17:21+00:00,lawmaster,"@jpurd17 What are you talking about? It's dead because incentives are completely screwed up and people are starting to realize. IEOs incentivize to buy the pre-sale and sell within the first two months to flip for profits. Until that changes, the concept is dead."

14157,2019-10-16 13:11:31+00:00,lawmaster,"@josephhurtado Since Binance popularized EIOs early this year, approximately 270 projects have raised funds through an IEO. At least 57 exchanges have facilitated at least one IEO. Two little known exchanges, ProBit and Coineal, have facilitated a quarter of all the IEOs. All of them are crap https://t.co/4s4HZO8Jub"
14158,2019-10-16 13:10:40+00:00,lawmaster,@josephhurtado Some projects that ICO'd also returned a lot to investors. The point is that it's such a small percentage that the whole concept died off. The same is happening with IEOs. There is simply not enough of good projects and too much demand to raise money
14159,2019-10-16 13:09:06+00:00,lawmaster,@kaiynne USD and BTC return is vs IEO price. ATH is vs ATH

14162,2019-10-16 13:03:19+00:00,lawmaster,"6/ The data shows that Binance has, by far, the highest average USD return on IEOs across the examined exchanges. Bittrex, on the other hand, has by far the lowest (and negative) USD return. https://t.co/FWcqSooTKS"
14163,2019-10-16 13:02:21+00:00,lawmaster,"5/ All but 5 projects (86%) have lost 50% of value since their all-time high, and 57% of projects lost more than 75% of value since ATH. In comparison, in late July, about 75% of projects lost 50% of value since their all-time high, and 39% of projects lost more than 75%. https://t.co/qHPCnBR5Hv"
14164,2019-10-16 13:01:42+00:00,lawmaster,"4/ IEOs‚Äô largest appeal is its speculative nature. The all-time high return of 13 projects has been higher than 500%. But because most of the investors buy the tokens just to sell them for a higher price a few months later, the price is never sustained. https://t.co/IdomHEjKQZ"
14165,2019-10-16 13:00:46+00:00,lawmaster,"3/ Perhaps a more indicative metric is a return in terms of bitcoin, which shows the projects that have outperformed or underperformed bitcoin since having an IEO. 16 projects, less than half, have outperformed bitcoin. https://t.co/piQeGpkuHg"

14167,2019-10-16 12:58:46+00:00,lawmaster,"1/ Since I last wrote about IEOs, the situation has only gotten worse. Now I think it's clear IEOs are dead, just as it was clear about ICOs in early 2018. The vast majority of projects can't sustain value and continue bleeding"

14286,2019-10-08 14:02:04+00:00,lawmaster,"5/ To start, Bitfinex did not even engage in a formal contract with Crypto Capital despite handing the firm about $1 billion.

14462,2019-09-28 07:29:56+00:00,lawmaster,@CarrascosaCris_ He is not technically securitizing his contract. He is just promising that the money he earns will be paid out to investors. I'm not sure they can stop that

14464,2019-09-28 07:25:05+00:00,lawmaster,This is a disappointing reaction from the @NBA to say the least. But I think they are misunderstanding the structure of @SDinwiddie_25's tokens.

14497,2019-09-27 07:16:52+00:00,lawmaster,"I could definitely see other athletes doing the same soon. I really think this could become a new asset class for investors to bet on players‚Äô careers. But it would have to be opened up for non-accredited investors, divided in much smaller portions and traded with liquidity."
14498,2019-09-27 07:16:44+00:00,lawmaster,"The biggest problem that I see is that he is issuing it under Reg D, which means that it‚Äôs only available for accredited investors. The minimum investment is $150,000. This is obviously not his fault. If this was available at a smaller size, I would probably invest a bit myself."
14499,2019-09-27 07:16:36+00:00,lawmaster,Dinwiddie is also incentivized to keep performing well because he is not tokenizing his entire contract - only a portion. And he also wants to sign the best contract possible in two years. He could theoretically (but unlikely) sign a max contract in 2 years worth $100M+
14500,2019-09-27 07:16:14+00:00,lawmaster,"The incentives are therefore lined up well for both sides. If he plays well, investors earn the upside of bonuses and the new contract. If he doesn't play well (or gets injured) and doesn't do anything stupid off the court (very uncommon), investors still earn interest on top."
14501,2019-09-27 07:16:07+00:00,lawmaster,"There is also virtually no risk of non-payment. Dinwiddie‚Äôs contract is guaranteed for three years. If he doesn‚Äôt play well, or even if he gets a bad injury, he still earns the money no matter what. The only way he loses his contract is if he does something stupid off the court."
14502,2019-09-27 07:15:59+00:00,lawmaster,"If he opts out after year 2 and signs a much larger contract, investors collect that upside from what he earns in year 3. On top of that, NBA players earn pretty sizable bonuses for both individual (All-Star selection) and team achievements (playoff appearance)."
14503,2019-09-27 07:15:50+00:00,lawmaster,"The token is actually really well thought out. Investors will receive monthly payments plus interest. Dinwiddie gets more of his contract upfront. Now that would be just a boring bond. But, investors also get potential bonuses as well as potentially a much larger payout in year 3"
14504,2019-09-27 07:15:37+00:00,lawmaster,"Spencer Dinwiddie (@SDinwiddie_25), Brooklyn Nets NBA player, is tokenizing 40% of his $34M 3-year contract and is also releasing a platform for other athletes to do the same.

14871,2019-08-31 10:55:12+00:00,lawmaster,@fluffypony @StopAndDecrypt @TheBlock__ There is a reason why nearly all crypto hedge funds and VC funds subscribe to Genesis. The subscription pays for itself in a couple of pieces that we produce. And we usually produce 10 full research pieces a week in addition to 5 op-ed colums written by our analysts.

1. Massive time-saving investment. We also welcome recommendations for new research.

14962,2019-08-24 13:22:50+00:00,lawmaster,@theonevortex @La__Cuen The fact that it has so far held up doesn't indicate that it will in the future... You are betting on the fact that BTC's price will continue increasing indefinitely basically. And that there will be enough counterparties willing to pay the large fees
14963,2019-08-24 13:16:39+00:00,lawmaster,@La__Cuen 3. Bitcoin holders are not incentivized to spend bitcoin as they believe that scarcity/fixed supply will ensure that it becomes more valuable in the future. It's hard to create an economy around money that the majority doesn't want to spend. Payments in BTC have never taken off

1. Bitcoin's disinflationary policy means that as rewards continue to halve, fees will need to support the miners. IMO this could decrease Bitcoin's security as some miners could get priced out. If not, fees will be too high for most - L2/side chains"

The average crypto-friendly bank has TA of $5.2 billion. Nearly a third of all crypto-friendly banks now offer crypto custody"
15152,2019-08-14 16:51:34+00:00,lawmaster,I did some research into crypto-friendly banks as Coinbase lost Barclays this week. The large banks remain reluctant to provide banking to cryptocurrency businesses as the compliance costs and reputation risk continue to outweigh the benefits of the still-nascent crypto market.

15697,2019-07-12 08:08:38+00:00,lawmaster,"8/ In yesterday‚Äôs stream, CZ repeated multiple times that BNB is no longer a premine coin. I think that the new structure is trying to make it seem like BNB is a utility/ecosystem token as opposed to a security."
15698,2019-07-12 08:08:29+00:00,lawmaster,"7/ I am convinced that this change was made for regulatory compliance reasons. Binance removed any mentions of burning 20% of profit from its whitepaper and from its website. In yesterdays announcement, it said ""we‚Äôll still burn BNB based on trading volume"" - not based on profit."
15699,2019-07-12 08:08:22+00:00,lawmaster,6/ Binance will instead retain its BNB collected from trading fees. But it will still burn exactly the same amount without making open-market purchases. The market dynamics are the same as before.
15700,2019-07-12 08:08:15+00:00,lawmaster,"5/ So instead of burning BNB from its trading fee revenues, it will now start burning BNB from its team reserves. Now considering that the team never sold any BNB it got from the vesting schedule, nothing realistically changes."
15701,2019-07-12 08:08:02+00:00,lawmaster,4/ The most common misconception is that Binance acquires BNB it burns by making open-market purchases. It doesn‚Äôt. Binance burns BNB it collects from trading fees that are largely paid in BNB (because there is a trading fee discount).
15702,2019-07-12 08:07:53+00:00,lawmaster,"3/ Based on today‚Äôs burn, Binance generated $119.2 million in  profit in Q2 2019; 53% increase from Q1 2019. In its 2 years of existence, Binance has generated more than $850 million of profit. https://t.co/E1AGSiv7b4"
15703,2019-07-12 08:07:38+00:00,lawmaster,"2/ Binance burns 20% of profits every quarter until 100 million BNB is burned. So far, in the last two year, Binance burned 12.5 million BNB, which means it still has to burn 87.5 million. https://t.co/zDzzsKOrsK"
15704,2019-07-12 08:07:13+00:00,lawmaster,1/ Binance announced today that it will contribute the total team allocation of 80 million BNB (~$2.5 billion) to the BNB burn. BNB rallied by 10% since the then. But this doesn't change anything about the supply schedule since the final supply will remain unaffected at 100M BNB

15849,2019-07-03 11:47:49+00:00,lawmaster,"4/ The size of the burn logically varies depending on the revenue from trading fees and the price of LEO.

16153,2019-06-14 08:02:05+00:00,lawmaster,@huobi VPN will always be a solution. Just depends how good your VPN is
16154,2019-06-14 07:59:07+00:00,lawmaster,"Now, remember - this news comes just after Bittrex and Poloniex started geo-blocking US customers from having access to tens of different altcoins. This is all connected and it's going to become much much harder for U.S. customers to trade altcoins with uncertain reg status."
16155,2019-06-14 07:54:55+00:00,lawmaster,"The only solution for customers from the U.S. will be to use a VPN. Similarly to what people already do with Bitfinex and BitMEX. But of course, there is a bottleneck - Binance allows withdrawals of up to 2BTC ($16,500) without verification. Above that, you are out of luck"
16156,2019-06-14 07:52:49+00:00,lawmaster,"Also, Binance DEX won't help here in any way. Binance DEX currently only supports cryptocurrencies that are natively on Binance Chain, which is very very little. So unless there is some kind of a swap mechanism implemented soon, Binance DEX won't help."

16172,2019-06-12 12:40:04+00:00,lawmaster,17/ It‚Äôs currently not even clear whether Gram Asia is authorized to resell their SAFT; what‚Äôs clear is that they are trying to exit their position.

16173,2019-06-12 12:39:51+00:00,lawmaster,16/ Giving Telegram $1.7 billion in exchange for tokens in the future was a really bad idea and I‚Äôm sure most of the VCs have already written off their investment.

Several months later, Telegram also said that it would refund investors‚Äô money if TON doesn‚Äôt launch by October 2019 but that there ‚Äúcan be no assurance‚Äù of enough money left over to pay any such refunds."
16179,2019-06-12 12:38:57+00:00,lawmaster,10/ A large part of the appeal for VCs was that Telegram was planning to have a $1.15B public ICO in March 2018 but eventually ended up scrapping the plan in early May because of the unfavorable regulatory environment and having already raised enough from accredited investors.
16180,2019-06-12 12:38:48+00:00,lawmaster,"9/ Now, remember, Telegram sold a right to tokens released in the future‚Ää‚Äî‚Äänot equity. In comparison, Lyft raised nearly the same amount ($2.3 billion) in its initial public offering in March and its stock is currently trading at 33% below its IPO price."
16181,2019-06-12 12:38:37+00:00,lawmaster,"8/ Telegram sold SAFTs in a Reg D token offering to accredited investors in two $850 million rounds raising a total of $1.7 billion from fewer than 200 private investors.

16182,2019-06-12 12:38:24+00:00,lawmaster,"7/ Doesn‚Äôt this all sound oddly familiar? It should! Kik is¬†currently being sued by the SEC, partly because it sold tokens to the U.S. investors out of concerns it would run out of funds during 2017."
16183,2019-06-12 12:38:05+00:00,lawmaster,"6/ The speculation of launching its own blockchain started H2 2017 in the midst of the ICO mania.

16185,2019-06-12 12:37:49+00:00,lawmaster,"4/ Even though Telegram has tens of millions of user, it doesn‚Äôt have a business model because it believes ‚Äúin fast and secure messaging that is also 100% free.‚Äù Prior to raising money via a private token offering, Telegram was funded exclusively by Pavel Durov."
16186,2019-06-12 12:37:42+00:00,lawmaster,"3/ Perhaps because of Telegram‚Äôs privacy-minded orientation and its perceived independence, it has become one of the most popular messaging apps.

- 200 million active users
- 70 billion messages daily"
16187,2019-06-12 12:37:34+00:00,lawmaster,"2/ Telegram was launched in 2013 by the Durov brothers, founders of the Russian Facebook competitor VK. The premise of Telegram was to protect users‚Äô private conversations from government mass surveillance."

16229,2019-06-09 10:19:18+00:00,lawmaster,"@CryptoShark @ItsMeDegam If that was the case, why is BNB not there? Why are BTC maximalists tolerating LEO but not BNB?"
16230,2019-06-09 10:17:07+00:00,lawmaster,"Unlike BTC/ETH and others, LEO is still just a (centralized) exchange token with pretty high regulatory risk - similarly to BNB. It's not censorship resistant and holding LEO/BNB has nothing to do with ""understanding cryptocurrencies""."
16231,2019-06-09 10:12:25+00:00,lawmaster,"It‚Äôs such a joke that now the sentiment is becoming that if you understand cryptocurrencies, you are going to hold some LEO. And in many cases, people that are praising LEO were saying that BNB was a total cash grab/scam just a couple of months ago."

16399,2019-05-26 06:05:58+00:00,lawmaster,@durerus Well I just explained that there is backing of the USD. It‚Äôs just not as obvious as being backed by gold or something else. It‚Äôs backed by force
16400,2019-05-26 06:03:41+00:00,lawmaster,"@owenbjennings I would argue that for the USD, you have the government to fall back on. Whether there is an intrinsic value or not doesn‚Äôt really matter if you believe that it is in the government‚Äôs best interest for USD to not go away. And it is."

16423,2019-05-24 08:49:45+00:00,lawmaster,@paoloardoino @udiWertheimer @alistairmilne Well not necessarily. You can make fairly accurate educated guesses on who fakes volume and who doesn't. And then estimate what % of the volume is real and what is fake. Volume is still a significant matric but needs to always be supplied with disclosures.
16424,2019-05-24 08:46:02+00:00,lawmaster,@paoloardoino @udiWertheimer @alistairmilne The chart above and the chart you link does show all trading pairs aggregated among the exchanges. The issue is that 85% of that volume is fake and probably more. So velocity is a nice term but doesn't make sense here.
16425,2019-05-24 08:42:06+00:00,lawmaster,@udiWertheimer @paoloardoino @alistairmilne Exactly my point. It's not on-chain velocity regardless of what term is used

16593,2019-05-15 13:26:13+00:00,lawmaster,"Kevin Worth, CEO of CoinDesk, said last week that ‚Äúrevenue will be lower this year‚Äù and that ‚Äúprofitability will depend on its performance the rest of the year.‚Äù It's gonna be a tough year for CoinDesk but DCG ‚Äúis prepared to invest further in the business to expand operations.‚Äù"
16594,2019-05-15 13:24:39+00:00,lawmaster,"While CoinDesk is primarily a media company, events‚Ää like Consensus make up ~85% of its revenues; subsidizing its content creation and helping the company turn a profit last year. It also has two other income streams that took CoinDesk‚Äôs total revenue in 2018 to $25 million. https://t.co/jY7PThC7TN"
16595,2019-05-15 13:24:02+00:00,lawmaster,"These estimate line up with CoinDesk‚Äôs reported revenue from events in 2018 of $21 million, which includes two smaller events ‚Äì Consensus Invest and Consensus Singapore, which would have generated a little more than $5 million combined."
16596,2019-05-15 13:23:39+00:00,lawmaster,"Based on my estimates, Consensus generated a total of $5.8 million in 2017, $15.6 million in 2018 and $8.7 million in 2019.

16597,2019-05-15 13:22:14+00:00,lawmaster,"The drop is because:

16752,2019-05-08 11:51:08+00:00,lawmaster,I very highly suspect that this hack has something to do with Binance not implementing Segwit yet. Binance said that the security system was bypassed by structuring the transaction in a way that it didn‚Äôt trigger any safeguards.

1. They conveniently leave out that they changed their website quietly to include that its reserves could consist of loans to affiliates
2. Tether doesn't mention that they lied about being 100% backed by USD for several months"
16802,2019-05-06 09:50:19+00:00,lawmaster,Funny that they reference CoinMarketCap as proof that Tether trades at parity to USD.

17481,2019-03-20 13:35:02+00:00,lawmaster,My full thoughts here in a paywalled article: https://t.co/YBXJYXbnKl
17482,2019-03-20 13:34:00+00:00,lawmaster,"What they will probably start doing (if I were to guess) is start allowing customers that Binance blocks (USA, Canada, China etc.) Bittrex already hinted at doing this. And Huobi did as well. Because they can't compete in other ways
https://t.co/DgrCWyBgZe"
17483,2019-03-20 13:29:21+00:00,lawmaster,Competing against Binance from the perspective of other exchanges will be really tough. Replicating Launchpad is nearly impossible because other exchanges can't create as much hype and they don't have access to nearly as many customers.
17484,2019-03-20 13:25:02+00:00,lawmaster,"For projects, Launchpad is a no-brainer. Every project with little traction wants to be there. They give up less than 10% of their tokens to get:

- free marketing
- raise additional capital
- get listed on the largest retail-driven exchange
- get liquidity"
17485,2019-03-20 13:24:17+00:00,lawmaster,Who heard of Celer before they announced their launch on Binance? Binance has access to the most retail customers and in turn the most real liquidity.
17486,2019-03-20 13:23:25+00:00,lawmaster,What's important to realize is that these platforms' primary purpose isn't really fundraising. It‚Äôs about bootstrapping interest in the project. Binance only sells 6% of tokens in circulation and max raise has been a little over $7 million.
17487,2019-03-20 13:21:26+00:00,lawmaster,"Nearly every exchange is talking about ways to replicate Launchpad‚Äôs success; and some have already launched their own versions:

- Bittrex IEO
- KuCoin Spotlight
- Huobi Prime
- BitMex

Others will follow."
17488,2019-03-20 13:20:35+00:00,lawmaster,I was in Hong Kong last week and one of the most dominant conversation topics were Initial Exchange Offerings (IEOs) - basically copycats of Binance Launchpad. And it's becoming a huge theme for Asian exchanges but it's still under the radar.

18252,2019-01-15 15:35:39+00:00,lawmaster,"12/ As always, data used in this analysis can be found here: https://t.co/67vASEzmGH"
18253,2019-01-15 15:35:27+00:00,lawmaster,"11/ The growth of nodes, channels and capacity will likely continue as running a node will become gradually easier for the non-technical users. The real test in 2019 will be onboarding merchants that will actually accept bitcoin through LN. I'm rooting for it"
18254,2019-01-15 15:35:18+00:00,lawmaster,"10/ The maximum channel capacity, which was set at 0.168 BTC (~$600), is currently being lifted depending on which client is used; and it will be lifted across all clients within the next couple of months."
18255,2019-01-15 15:35:06+00:00,lawmaster,"9/ Sharing the capacity of the Lightning Network without disclosing that 64% of it is controlled by one entity seems at best counterproductive, and deceptive at worst."
18256,2019-01-15 15:34:56+00:00,lawmaster,8/ The most remarkable growth metric of LN seems to be the steadily growing number of nodes with active channels and that the nodes are gradually opening more channels.
18257,2019-01-15 15:34:46+00:00,lawmaster,7/ The average capacity per channel has increased but it‚Äôs clear that it was also affected by the entry of https://t.co/Z0racKmgwZ nodes. https://t.co/WDVnOGkvtY
18258,2019-01-15 15:34:28+00:00,lawmaster,"6/ The 10 largest LN nodes currently have 38% of the network‚Äôs capacity. In June last year it was 53%, which indicates an improvement. But the reliance on large nodes is still evident and the capacity is still so low that it can fairly easily be gamed by a single party. https://t.co/aWhsK4eiwn"

At the time of writing, https://t.co/Z0racKmgwZ has 20 public nodes totaling the capacity of 366 BTC (~$1.3M). One party‚Äôs 20 nodes (0.7% of total nodes) currently control 64% of the capacity. https://t.co/JNH73E5wlj"
18260,2019-01-15 15:33:47+00:00,lawmaster,"4/ The network‚Äôs capacity grew to 575.5 BTC (~$2 million). Interestingly, unlike the number of nodes and channels, the capacity isn‚Äôt growing linearly. The largest increase was recorded in early November when the LN‚Äôs capacity suddenly increased by 300% in just two weeks. https://t.co/uu7YSinpgC"
18261,2019-01-15 15:33:25+00:00,lawmaster,3/ It‚Äôs also worth pointing out that the average number of channels per node has been steadily increasing throughout the last year. There are now nearly 8 channels per each node. https://t.co/8W7yJUhn9g
