1753,2022-10-27 11:10:26+00:00,NorthmanTrader,There is no example where the unemployment rate peaked at 4.4% coming from 3.5%. None. Rather the peaks following such low readings ends in at least 6%-8% or worse. So the Fed is clinging to a soft landing no recession narrative despite all history.

3337,2022-08-11 15:04:14+00:00,NorthmanTrader,In keeping with the traditional big bear market rally psychology: It is when optimism returns people think the worst is over and the lows are in that often times these assumptions will get tested following a big counter move. I submit we're seeing this return to euphoria now. TBD
3338,2022-08-11 14:58:59+00:00,NorthmanTrader,"My sense is this time frame between mid August to end of October will give us the answer. I expect a lot of 2 way price chop in between as market negotiate the answer.

3339,2022-08-11 14:57:02+00:00,NorthmanTrader,Bottomline: The evidence whether June was a true structural bottom or this rally just being a bear market rally commensurate with previous historic examples that will eventually roll over is still outstanding in my view.
3340,2022-08-11 14:55:32+00:00,NorthmanTrader,"So to tie future market performance only to inflation rolling over may end up being a mistake. But I could be wrong of course.

3342,2022-08-11 14:52:02+00:00,NorthmanTrader,3. In the 70's &amp;d 80's the Fed was tightening into a 30% debt to GDP construct not a 125% debt to GDP construct. Nobody has a clue what the impact of rapid tightening is into such a backdrop.
3343,2022-08-11 14:51:25+00:00,NorthmanTrader,"2. Back then there was no QT, no Fed balance sheet to roll off &amp; drain liquidity out of the system. QT is just getting into full swing in Sept. If massive QE was the cue for markets to just drift higher during each occurrence since 2008 then QT at $95B a month will act as a drag."
3344,2022-08-11 14:50:07+00:00,NorthmanTrader,"1. In all of these ""bottom"" scenarios the Fed was already in an easing cycle by cutting rates extensively. None of this is happening right now. Rate hikes are still going on. We are in a period of monetary tightening not easing."

3346,2022-08-11 14:48:28+00:00,NorthmanTrader,"But I have one big concern.
I see a lot of charts on Twitter these days where people point out that in 1974 the lows were in as soon as inflation peaked and we were off to the races, similar to 1982, stocks recovered all their losses in 4 months and went on to new highs."
3347,2022-08-11 14:47:19+00:00,NorthmanTrader,"Now as inflation is indeed rolling over as suggested in the original article the question now is if this indeed was a structural low or whether this rally is still in keeping with a larger bear market rally.
To be clear: I remain open minded either way."
