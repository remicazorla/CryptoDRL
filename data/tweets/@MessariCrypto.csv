C. Traders lock loans into a private pool which is used to dial up and down leverage at the entry strike price.

D. Flash swaps can be used to execute transactions on-chain."
175,2023-02-10 15:30:09+00:00,MessariCrypto,"4/ How does @InfPools make this work?

A. LPs provide @Uniswap V3 tokens or raw liquidity into InifinityPools where it is made available to trade.

B. Infinity Pools combines LP assets into a new concentrated liquidity AMM pool called the Float Pool. https://t.co/EJ2CQgzeFS"
176,2023-02-10 15:30:07+00:00,MessariCrypto,"3/ @InfPools uses LP positions as the loan source.

In doing so, the payback of the loan can be in either of the LP assets removing the traditional cash constraint.

This results in a few advantages:

+Unlimited Leverage
+Unlimited Assets
+No Oracles
+No Liquidations
+Scalability"
177,2023-02-10 15:30:06+00:00,MessariCrypto,"2/ Normally, leveraged positions are created by borrowing cash ($USDC) from another party, which is expected to be paid back in the same asset borrowed.

When liquidated, leveraged assets must be sold for the exact amount of $USDC borrowed or bad debt occurs."
178,2023-02-10 15:30:05+00:00,MessariCrypto,"1/ @InfPools' leveraged swap protocol natively executes all facets of leveraged trades without outside, off-chain dependencies on liquidators, counterparties, or oracles like other leverage products, eliminating the inefficiencies of traditional DeFi primitives.üßµ https://t.co/o6xFOrkMYw"

Ordinals‚Äô activity has increased network fees per block by an average of 25% and has grown to capture almost 30% of the maximum blockspace."
190,2023-02-09 17:00:38+00:00,MessariCrypto,"2/ How does it work?

Ordinals focus on #BTC's smallest units, satoshis.

Arbitrary data, such as NFTs, accounts, or stablecoins can be attached to satoshis as identifiers.

From there, rarity can be determined by theorists based on things like periodic events."

https://t.co/7i6S0TdrFA"
193,2023-02-09 16:13:21+00:00,MessariCrypto,"7/ Looking at network activity, @WAX_io averages over 20M daily transactions and around 350,000 daily active addresses, placing WAX among the leaders across blockchains.

These metrics are likely inflated by bot activity, as is expected for a gaming network. https://t.co/6orZM7u70j"
194,2023-02-09 16:13:19+00:00,MessariCrypto,"6/ @WAX_io's $WAXP has a 5% annual inflation rate and 0.4% of all NFT secondary sales are collected in WAXP and burned. The 5% is distributed to:

+Staking rewards (40%)
+Block producers (40%)
+Worker proposal system (20%)"
195,2023-02-09 16:13:18+00:00,MessariCrypto,"5/ As stated, @WAX_io's native token $WAXP is used for network security (validator and delegator staking) and resource allocation (CPU and NET staking, RAM buying and selling).

At launch, 1.8B WAXP tokens were minted. https://t.co/lOt5lxxNBN"
196,2023-02-09 16:13:16+00:00,MessariCrypto,"4/ @WAX_io accounts have two key roles: an admin key and an active key creating account abstraction-like effects which improve UX.

WAX's Cloud Wallet allows users to create an account with 2FA and Web2 credentials, such as an email and password, or familiar app logins."
197,2023-02-09 16:13:15+00:00,MessariCrypto,"3/ Smart contracts on @WAX_io are written in C++, a popular language among Web2 devs.

Moving to Wax's resource model, resources on separated into their own components:

+NET
+CPU
+RAM

NET and CPU cover network bandwidth costs of the network, and RAM for a user's data storage."
198,2023-02-09 16:13:15+00:00,MessariCrypto,"2/ Starting with @WAX_io's architecture, Wax employs a Delegated PoS (DPoS) mechanism where $WAXP token holders delegate their tokens to validators (‚ÄúWAX Guilds‚Äù), who produce and validate blocks.

Both guilds and delegators earn 40% of the network‚Äôs 5% annual inflation."
199,2023-02-09 16:13:14+00:00,MessariCrypto,"1/ Understanding the downsides of traditional gaming and in-game asset ownership, @WAX_io has been built for the dedicated purpose of hosting gaming and NFT use cases.üßµ https://t.co/cvtf4XlLhP"

A Proof-of-Stake blockchain built using @cosmos SDK.

Cross-chain Gateway Protocol (CGP) to relay and synchronize data across chains.

215,2023-02-08 19:00:12+00:00,MessariCrypto,"4/ Unlike most interoperability networks, @axelarcore allows gas fees to be paid once on the destination chain and with the destination token.

Axelar‚Äôs gas services conveniently handle all conversions required in the cross-chain transaction flow."
216,2023-02-08 19:00:11+00:00,MessariCrypto,"3/ A recent example of this is @circle's use of @axelarcore's GMP to support its Cross-chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) for Composable $USDC.

This integration allows developers to seamlessly integrate $USDC into their dApps, which allows users to transact without wrapping assets."
217,2023-02-08 19:00:11+00:00,MessariCrypto,"2/ At its core, Axelar‚Äôs General Message Passing (GMP) advances the cross-chain communication of arbitrary data, enabling composable liquidity, cross-chain governance, and cross-chain transfer of assets that cannot be wrapped, such as NFTs."

229,2023-02-07 15:42:55+00:00,MessariCrypto,"3/ So how does Bet-to-Play (B2P) work?

1929,2022-10-12 14:33:55+00:00,MessariCrypto,"6/ Despite the lack of demand for leverage, yield still incentivizes demand for $DAI, which is achieved through G-UNI LP tokens continuing to bolster demand. 

This might be a good demand hack for $DAI, given the $DAI Savings Rate must come from earnings. https://t.co/KDDAeHwMzn"
1930,2022-10-12 14:33:54+00:00,MessariCrypto,"5/ Almost a quarter of @MakerDAO's revenue now comes from non-ETH or BTC-based assets. 

Although diversification is good, the reason for the change is the collapse in revenue from #ETH and #BTC. https://t.co/3ksF39V03S"
1931,2022-10-12 14:33:53+00:00,MessariCrypto,"4/ On the subject of yield-bearing assets, the growth of G-UNI LP tokens as collateral continued in Q3‚Äô22, increasing another 18%.

In #ETH terms, borrowing TVL fell nearly a quarter on Maker in Q3‚Äô22. 

With $DAI's current demand tied to leveraged price exposure, growth will remain tied to Real World Assets (RWA) and macro forces. https://t.co/KF3QFEYRzY"

1956,2022-10-10 23:00:15+00:00,MessariCrypto,"6/ While the quantitative narrative of Q3 was relatively unexciting, the qualitative narrative was filled with building the @avalancheavax ecosystem and remaining laser-focused on executing its growth strategy. https://t.co/tvRvtoUCpS"
1957,2022-10-10 23:00:13+00:00,MessariCrypto,"5/ The downturn in TVL wasn't isolated to DeFi.

@avalancheavax's nascent NFT market experienced declines in secondary sales volume (-88.8%) and unique buyers (-34.5%) while unique sellers increased by 25.1%. https://t.co/CeeUf3B3iq"
1958,2022-10-10 23:00:10+00:00,MessariCrypto,"4/ As @avalancheavax's DeFi incentive program Avalanche Rush wound down in Q3, TVL fell roughly 27% in both $USD and $AVAX quarter over quarter (QoQ).

As TVL reverts back to its mean, it reflects a sustainable utility instead of a value catalyzed purely by incentives. https://t.co/AJMHwFhw14"
1959,2022-10-10 23:00:09+00:00,MessariCrypto,"3/ Subnets have clearly put downward pressure on revenue and, to some extent, network value over the short term.

The relationship between revenue and value continues to beg the question of whether subnets negatively impact the utility of the $AVAX token and C-Chain value. https://t.co/yBjX7CrfRh"
1960,2022-10-10 23:00:07+00:00,MessariCrypto,"2/ While network value increased slightly (3.3%), usage and revenue generation dramatically declined.

Average daily transactions declined by 65.5%, and with a welcomed 76.2% decline in transaction fees, total revenue declined by 94.1%. https://t.co/fr1MowaQqm"

1962,2022-10-10 20:00:15+00:00,MessariCrypto,"7/ Although @LiquityProtocol yields have cooled down from a volatile Q2, the system benefited from the $LUSD supply and the system's collateral increasing in Q3.

1964,2022-10-10 20:00:12+00:00,MessariCrypto,"5/ Despite a significantly worse quarter for earnings, @LiquityProtocol drew many participants to stake and deposit in the Stability Pool.

The number of depositors climbed by 25% in Q3‚Äô22.

The number of $LQTY stakers only increased 6.6% QoQ. https://t.co/x6aDK99NIa"
1965,2022-10-10 20:00:11+00:00,MessariCrypto,"4/ The lack of new loan demand hurt $LQTY stakers the most, yielding under $1,000 in issuance fees in the quarter.

Stakers still earned a 5% APR from $LUSD rewards from redemptions. https://t.co/Nd3EgaYr4t"
1966,2022-10-10 20:00:09+00:00,MessariCrypto,"3/ Even with a higher system collateral ratio, these new loans have pushed out the liquidation distribution as the price of $ETH rose.

Even so, if $ETH were to drop back to Q2 lows below 900, it would only cause 5% of outstanding deposits to be liquidated. https://t.co/GDmvxF1NoX"
1967,2022-10-10 20:00:08+00:00,MessariCrypto,"2/ After $115 million of liquidations during the Q2 chaos, @LiquityProtocol saw $476,497 of liquidations in Q3.

The system collateral ratio improved from 2.17 on June 30 to 2.47 by the end of September. https://t.co/PfkDGfNhMo"
1968,2022-10-10 20:00:06+00:00,MessariCrypto,"1/ After a very profitable Q2 due to the overall market chaos, @LiquityProtocol users and depositors had a much less eventful Q3‚Äô22.

1970,2022-10-10 14:09:59+00:00,MessariCrypto,"4/ Zooming into L2s, the concentration of $USDC is materially higher on the rollups than on the base network. 

$USDC once again reigns supreme, but even more delightful for those at @circlepay, its share of the market is higher than 50% for both networks. https://t.co/EfswBj6veb"
1971,2022-10-10 14:09:59+00:00,MessariCrypto,"3/ Around half of all stablecoins are found on #Ethereum.

Since $USDC's market cap peaked in July, its percentage has been on a steady fall, losing more than 5% to date. 

During that same time, $BUSD market share has had an inverse correlation with $USDC. https://t.co/mjUwBBE3eq"
1972,2022-10-10 14:09:59+00:00,MessariCrypto,"2/ $USDT continues to lead across all the top blockchains with a market cap exceeding $68B. 

This is followed by $USDC with a market cap of $45B.

While this view paints a picture of the entirety of the stablecoin market, activity is not evenly distributed. https://t.co/AJd6wS5xJE"
1973,2022-10-10 14:09:58+00:00,MessariCrypto,"1/ Realizing the positive correlation between stablecoin supply and ecosystem stability, protocols have created a new trend: protocol-native stablecoins.

$DOT bonded through parachain slot auctions is locked on the Relay Chain and thus removed from circulation.

2564,2022-09-14 15:44:37+00:00,MessariCrypto,"7/ swNFT holds information about the stake, linking it to the yield earned by the initial ETH deposited to the node operator. 

In order to actually receive the rewards (and principal), users need to burn the swNFT with the initial deposited $swETH amount."
2565,2022-09-14 15:44:36+00:00,MessariCrypto,"6/ $swETH is a non-rebasing, ERC-20, liquid staking derivative token representing the principal stake. 

Once liquid staking (withdrawals) goes live, stakers will have the option to use swETH across DeFi."
2566,2022-09-14 15:44:36+00:00,MessariCrypto,"5/ In this model, the stake isn‚Äôt naturally liquid since it‚Äôs tied to a particular node operator.

@swellnetworkio has found a way to mitigate this by abstracting away the deposited $ETH from the staking yield by using the $swETH derivative and the swNFT. https://t.co/ydGXbm0Dpd"
2567,2022-09-14 15:44:36+00:00,MessariCrypto,"4/ Since @swellnetworkio uses atomic deposits, users delegate stake (a minimum of 1 $ETH) directly into a Beacon Chain deposit contract of their choice.

2568,2022-09-14 15:44:35+00:00,MessariCrypto,"3/ @swellnetworkio's node operator set is represented by two groups, verified and independent operators.

Node operators will set their commission rate, the amount of additional yield sent to their Swell fee pool, and how their returns are displayed, creating an open marketplace."

A less ideal solution would be a language-level compatible EVM, transpiling Solidity into code that a non-EVM virtual machine can read."
3707,2022-07-22 14:40:18+00:00,MessariCrypto,"3/ The EVM runtime was not built to support ZKPs, which is the gap that zkEVM projects are working diligently to close.

A zkEVM would support the same smart contract capabilities as @ethereum, allowing developers to move any contract from Ethereum L1 directly to a zkEVM."
3708,2022-07-22 14:40:18+00:00,MessariCrypto,"2/ Each zkEVM plans to operate as a Layer-2 (L2) rollup. 

An L2 rollup batches user transactions together for cheaper gas costs and faster local processing while preserving the security guarantees of L1. 

There are two main types of rollups:

Alternatively, software dVPNs allow anyone to use them as long as they pay for the service."

3934,2022-07-15 15:42:35+00:00,MessariCrypto,"2/ dVPNs are pretty similar to VPNs, but they do have a few differences:

+Incentivization ‚Äî node operators earn token rewards for bandwidth
+Pay structures ‚Äî one-time (Hardware) vs pay-as-you-go (Software)
+Multi-routing ‚Äî node switching / use different routes and servers"

5089,2022-06-09 14:21:45+00:00,MessariCrypto,"6/ Learning from the above, the true market cap for crypto should be the dollar amount needed to own the protocol entirely.

Translating to crypto, it would typically mean owning the fully diluted or max supply less the supply held in the protocol treasury. https://t.co/3e8C4ZkORr"

5109,2022-06-08 17:00:47+00:00,MessariCrypto,"4/ The bigger issue is the long-term revenue accruing to fundamental tokenholders. 

The @optimismPBC ecosystem needs to more clearly link fees back to the tokenholders.

Optimism has a simple business model: they sell blockspace on L2 and buy blockspace on L1. https://t.co/34iO6k5RF8"
5110,2022-06-08 17:00:46+00:00,MessariCrypto,"2/ After claim, $OP experienced a heavy amount of sell pressure dropping from $4.50 a token to under $1.00 in a matter of hours.

Because of this sell pressure, there was a heavily supported proposal on the @optimismPBC governance forum to disqualify sellers from future airdrops."

5699,2022-05-11 02:17:58+00:00,MessariCrypto,"7/ @LFG_org, the organization created to defend the peg, mobilized its reserves during this episode. 

All of the roughly 80,000 $BTC were sold &amp; or loaned out to market makers to provide $UST liquidity at key levels."
5700,2022-05-11 02:17:58+00:00,MessariCrypto,"6/ On Saturday, @CurveFinance's key pools started to diverge from equilibrium suggesting traders were selling $UST &amp; LPs were pulling at-risk capitaI. 

The trend accelerated on Monday, when the $UST-3pool was almost entirely drained of counter-side liquidity with $UST at +95%. https://t.co/BISXHJbiqS"
5701,2022-05-11 02:17:58+00:00,MessariCrypto,"5/ Amidst a broader market selloff, the large &amp; sudden $UST supply introduction created reflexive sell pressure on $LUNA which culminated in the de-pegging event.

Large amounts of capital were deployed at $0.98 to protect the peg, but reflexive selling accelerated."
5702,2022-05-11 02:17:58+00:00,MessariCrypto,"4/ With a supply outflow this large, pressure would be put on critical peg stabilization junctures like @CurveFinance. 

Around the same time, the C was also pulling funds for liquidity for the 4pool."
5703,2022-05-11 02:17:57+00:00,MessariCrypto,"3/ Saturday marked the start of the $UST de-pegging cascade. 

@binance experienced a slight 25 bps depeg May 7, likely due to 3AC and @GenesisTrading unloading their @UST from the @LFG_org $BTC purchases."
5704,2022-05-11 02:17:57+00:00,MessariCrypto,"2/ Last week, @LFG_org purchased an additional 37K $BTC for the $UST reserves from 3AC &amp; @GenesisTrading to bring their total holdings to almost 80K $BTC. 

This event was likely the first domino to fall in a series of events that led to $UST de-pegging."

6728,2022-03-24 14:28:59+00:00,MessariCrypto,"6/ @terra_money's ultimate success is $UST adoption, whether on the growing Terra ecosystem or abroad on CEXs and other chains. 

$UST is the clear decentralized stable frontrunner in several categories:

+Largest supply 
+Fastest growing circulating supply
+Fastest growing usage https://t.co/cQMfwkoWPK"
6729,2022-03-24 14:28:59+00:00,MessariCrypto,"5/ Debt protocols account for roughly half of the entire network‚Äôs TVL, and at nearly 96% growth in 90 days, they are the fastest-growing DeFi sector in TVL.

6731,2022-03-24 14:28:58+00:00,MessariCrypto,"3/ @terra_money's TVL growth (+49%) is largely due to the price of $LUNA substantially increasing as well as the continued expansion of the UST supply. 

As such, the make-up of TVL share in the emerging smart contract ecosystems has changed. https://t.co/NbJcaVGRrQ"
6732,2022-03-24 14:28:58+00:00,MessariCrypto,"2/ Smart contract tokens, exclusive of $LUNA, are down 12% over the last 30 days.

Meanwhile, $LUNA is up over 76% in the same period.

Two core reasons are driving the repricing of the asset:

1. Risk Rerating: $BTC Added As Reserve Asset
2. Increased Usage &amp; Fundamentals"

When growing an exclusive community, later members typically see diminishing returns.

9573,2021-03-26 15:42:34+00:00,MessariCrypto,Essentially the system devalues or revalues RAI according to a redemption rate (rate at which RAI is being devalued or revalued) to incentivize people to borrow or pay back their debt.
9574,2021-03-26 15:42:33+00:00,MessariCrypto,"The way this works is that as RAI moves away from its redemption price, the protocol automatically adjusts its redemption price to proportionally oppose the price move in order to stabilize RAI."
9575,2021-03-26 15:42:33+00:00,MessariCrypto,"However, RAI introduces a number of changes to the SCD model.

10902,2020-12-03 15:21:06+00:00,MessariCrypto,"The ETH derivatives space as a whole is understandably still very early, but should play a much larger role in the wake of the the Beacon Chain and proof of stake on Ethereum 2.0."
10903,2020-12-03 15:21:06+00:00,MessariCrypto,"In addition to being available for use across DeFi protocols, DETH could be packaged into a host of other products:

+ ETF-like index products¬†
+ Swap products that allow stakers to fix their yield and traders to speculate on yield¬†
+ Structured products like fixed income"
10904,2020-12-03 15:21:06+00:00,MessariCrypto,"With a large addressable market and multiple flavors of DETH, there will be many additional financial services built on top of ETH staking derivatives."
10905,2020-12-03 15:21:05+00:00,MessariCrypto,"This flavor of DETH will resemble securitized products like mortgage-backed securities. Where mortgage-backed securities represent the value of an aggregation of many loans, staking derivatives will pool staking positions into a single package and then tokenize them. https://t.co/rBhIz8zmc6"
10906,2020-12-03 15:21:04+00:00,MessariCrypto,"Decentralized staking solutions will also create a flavor of DETH that will depend not on the competency of a single provider, but on the competency of a pool of providers, diversifying the overall slashing risk."
10907,2020-12-03 15:21:04+00:00,MessariCrypto,Meanwhile validators will gain the ability to scale their operations without needing to purchase 32 ETH for each validator they run.
10908,2020-12-03 15:21:04+00:00,MessariCrypto,"Decentralized solutions will reduce the 32 ETH barrier to entry for stakers while allowing them to outsource the infrastructure requirements, giving them liquidity on their stake, all while supporting the decentralization of Ethereum."
10909,2020-12-03 15:21:03+00:00,MessariCrypto,"These protocols will first allow users to pool their ETH together, then allocate that pooled ETH to a network of validators for staking."
10910,2020-12-03 15:21:03+00:00,MessariCrypto,"However, staking concentration among centralized providers could threaten Ethereum‚Äôs PoS security. Thankfully, decentralized solutions like @Rocket_Pool and @StaFi_Protocol  will create two sided marketplaces for staking that will match stakers with validators."
10911,2020-12-03 15:21:03+00:00,MessariCrypto,"Since exchanges are already in the game of capital aggregation and in the past have raced to offer ancillary services outside of trading, there‚Äôs little doubt they will jump at this opportunity."
10912,2020-12-03 15:21:03+00:00,MessariCrypto,"Exchanges are particularly well positioned to be major DETH issuers, as they‚Äôre among the largest holders of ETH and issuers of other wrapped assets (mainly stablecoins)."
10913,2020-12-03 15:21:02+00:00,MessariCrypto,Certain ETH derivative tokens may find themselves as illiquid as the underlying ETH locked in the deposit contract so stakers must choose wisely.
10914,2020-12-03 15:21:02+00:00,MessariCrypto,"Lastly, secondary market liquidity for different flavors of DETH will come into play. Just as the market has settled on a small handful of fiat-backed stablecoins, it will likely settle on a handful of DETH solutions."
10915,2020-12-03 15:21:02+00:00,MessariCrypto,Stakers will have to trust that whichever service they stake to is adequately maintaining their validator. Failure to do so will lead to reduced rewards and slashing penalties. Custodial risks will need to be considered as well.
10916,2020-12-03 15:21:02+00:00,MessariCrypto,"While this will allow stakers to have their cake and eat it too by earning validator rewards while still maintaining liquidity on their ETH, there are considerations to be made."
10917,2020-12-03 15:21:01+00:00,MessariCrypto,"In addition to managing validator software, these services will accept ETH staking deposits and mint a corresponding amount of DETH for the depositor. DETH will represent a claim on the underlying stake that the depositor can put to work across various DeFi protocols."
10918,2020-12-03 15:21:01+00:00,MessariCrypto,We‚Äôre likely to see multiple flavors of DETH issued by exchanges and staking pools that will allow stakers to rehypothecate their staked ETH for use across DeFi.

10921,2020-12-03 15:20:59+00:00,MessariCrypto,"Recognizing the illiquidity and opportunity costs stakers face, multiple solutions have emerged that will allow stakers to gain liquidity on their staked ETH. 

For example, @liquidstake will allow stakers to borrow USDC against ETH staked through their platform."
10922,2020-12-03 15:20:58+00:00,MessariCrypto,"Validators can earn anywhere from 4-23% yield on their staked ETH, but it‚Äôs difficult to say whether or not that capital could be put to more productive use elsewhere; particularly if the current market momentum continues."
10923,2020-12-03 15:20:58+00:00,MessariCrypto,"While this indefinite lockup was a security conscious decision made by developers, it imposes a high opportunity cost on stakers."
10924,2020-12-03 15:20:58+00:00,MessariCrypto,The first step to becoming an ETH 2.0 validator requires sending at least 32 ETH to a deposit contract on Ethereum‚Äôs PoW chain. The deposit contract is a one-way street and any ETH staked for ETH 2.0 will be locked until ETH's PoW chain is merged with ETH 2 (likely 2022)

10938,2020-12-02 17:10:50+00:00,MessariCrypto,"It is likely that big name DeFi apps won‚Äôt stray too far from Ethereum and will end up on some version of a rollup, if they move from the base layer at all."
10939,2020-12-02 17:10:50+00:00,MessariCrypto,"It could also negate the need for the final phase of Ethereum 2.0, allowing Ethereum to reach its desired scalability by the end of 2022."
10940,2020-12-02 17:10:50+00:00,MessariCrypto,"Combined with PoS and sharding, roll-ups would allow Ethereum to support a theoretical max of ~100,000 transactions per second, or a ~10,000x improvement over the current network capacity."
10941,2020-12-02 17:10:49+00:00,MessariCrypto,"DeFi darling @synthetix_io has already deployed the first application on Optimism‚Äôs public testnet, and some suspect @UniswapProtocol will follow suit."
10942,2020-12-02 17:10:49+00:00,MessariCrypto,"These include: 

+ @optimismPBC's Optimistic Ethereum 
+ @the_matter_labs‚Äô zkSync  
+ @OffchainLabs‚Äô Arbitrum"
10943,2020-12-02 17:10:49+00:00,MessariCrypto,"While rollups are still a few months away from being production-ready, there‚Äôs already a burgeoning ecosystem forming around various rollup flavors."
10944,2020-12-02 17:10:48+00:00,MessariCrypto,Rollups have quickly become the go-to scaling solution for Ethereum‚Äôs PoW chain due to their ability to run smart contracts off-chain. Rollups are essentially new blockchains that process transactions independently of Ethereum before settling batch transactions to the main chain https://t.co/qjLAApJygh
10945,2020-12-02 17:10:48+00:00,MessariCrypto,Layer-2 solutions can significantly improve the number of transactions a Layer-1 can process without bogging down the underlying network with excess data and computing requests.
10946,2020-12-02 17:10:47+00:00,MessariCrypto,"In general, layer-2 scaling solutions facilitate transactions through off-chain means before bundling and submitting them as a single transaction to the base layer."
10947,2020-12-02 17:10:47+00:00,MessariCrypto,"In the near term, however, Layer-1‚Äôs aren‚Äôt competing with Ethereum 2.0. They‚Äôre in a much tighter race against viable Layer-2 solutions on Ethereum‚Äôs existing PoW chain. In particular, a solution known as ‚Äúrollups‚Äù."
10948,2020-12-02 17:10:47+00:00,MessariCrypto,"Others are building chains compatible with Ethereum‚Äôs virtual machine (EVM) that will offer familiar environments for Ethereum developers with minimal switching costs:

+ @avalancheavax's Athereum¬†
+ @Polkadot‚Äôs Moonbeam"
10949,2020-12-02 17:10:47+00:00,MessariCrypto,"Several networks are nearing completion on bridges to Ethereum that will allow value on Ethereum to interoperate with applications on competing chains:¬†

+ @NEARProtocol's Rainbow Bridge
+ @cosmos' Peggy
+ @solana's Wormhole"
10950,2020-12-02 17:10:46+00:00,MessariCrypto,"It‚Äôs easy to write off these new networks, as they are miles behind Ethereum in terms of developer firepower, financial middleware, and tradable tokens. But the competition is just getting started."
10951,2020-12-02 17:10:46+00:00,MessariCrypto,Those snake-bitten by rising fees will inevitably explore alternative platforms with better transaction throughput and lower fees if they haven‚Äôt already.
10952,2020-12-02 17:10:46+00:00,MessariCrypto,"Most new Layer-1s, whether it be @cosmos, @Polkadot, or @solana, have built their platforms partially based on the premise that developers and new retail users will grow tired of Ethereum‚Äôs unrelentingly high costs. Their strategy is not wrong."
10953,2020-12-02 17:10:46+00:00,MessariCrypto,"Meanwhile, nearly every high profile Ethereum competitor has launched or will launch by the end of 2020. The gap between now and a user ready stage of ETH 2.0 leaves an opportunity for other low-fee, low-latency competitors to eat into Ethereum‚Äôs monopoly"
10954,2020-12-02 17:10:45+00:00,MessariCrypto,This puts Ethereum in a precarious position following this summer‚Äôs DeFi bull market where network congestion created an unpredictable and oftentimes unforgiving fee market for users and developers.
10955,2020-12-02 17:10:45+00:00,MessariCrypto,"With basic transaction functionality 1-2 years away, ETH 2.0 can‚Äôt be a near term scaling solution for the current network."
10956,2020-12-02 17:10:45+00:00,MessariCrypto,"The launch of the Beacon Chain only signals the beginning of a multi-year journey towards scalability. Phase 0 is for staking and little else and at present, the Beacon Chain‚Äôs functionality¬†is practically non-existent."

10976,2020-12-01 19:55:29+00:00,MessariCrypto,"There are a variety of ways of approaching these costs that include doing everything yourself, outsourcing infrastructure to staking-as-a-service providers and exchanges, or pooling resources (both ETH and infrastructure) to validate."
10977,2020-12-01 19:55:29+00:00,MessariCrypto,"3) Infrastructure costs 

One of the main benefits of Proof of Stake is that it will cost just $120 a year to run a beacon node and validator client, which may be done using consumer hardware."
10978,2020-12-01 19:55:28+00:00,MessariCrypto,"2) Opportunity costs 

Stakers will be unable to withdraw their stake until Phase 1.5"
10979,2020-12-01 19:55:28+00:00,MessariCrypto,"In addition to rewards and penalties, which will determine the headline yield validators receive, validators must also consider various costs. 

1) Capital costs 
2) Opportunity costs 
3) Infrastructure costs"
10980,2020-12-01 19:55:27+00:00,MessariCrypto,".@BisonTrails estimates that if a validator is online greater than ~54% of the time, it should break even."
10981,2020-12-01 19:55:27+00:00,MessariCrypto,"Validators who perform inadequately (failing to remain online) or maliciously, will receive reduced rewards and could even risk losing some or all of their stake via slashing penalties."
10982,2020-12-01 19:55:26+00:00,MessariCrypto,"Validator rewards will go down as staking participation goes up.

This means that earlier validators will be rewarded more heavily for helping bootstrap Ethereum's PoS mechanism https://t.co/OL6ZCSIflG"
10983,2020-12-01 19:55:25+00:00,MessariCrypto,"Eth2 validators will be rewarded with newly issued ETH based on two factors:

10988,2020-12-01 18:41:12+00:00,MessariCrypto,"Why do validators stake 32 ETH? 

This number was a deliberate design choice since acquiring this amount is relatively attainable (~$19,000 at current prices) but expensive enough to prevent the validator count from ballooning to a point that would cause network overhead issues."
10989,2020-12-01 18:00:57+00:00,MessariCrypto,"More on what the introduction of PoS means for $ETH in the full report

10990,2020-12-01 18:00:56+00:00,MessariCrypto,".@ConsenSys estimates that in order to match the current security of Ethereum‚Äôs PoW chain, just under 16 million ETH would need to be staked. At this point, validators would be earning a theoretical max of 4.4% per year (all of these figures assume 100% uptime)."
10991,2020-12-01 18:00:56+00:00,MessariCrypto,"How much do validators make? 

The amount of yield that individual validators receive will be based on the total amount of ETH staked. Basically, the rewards validators receive will go down as staking participation goes up. https://t.co/B8BeweIlLc"
10992,2020-12-01 18:00:55+00:00,MessariCrypto,"The main catch here is that the deposit contract is a one-way street. Once ETH is staked, that stake, along with the accrued rewards will be completely immobile until a later phase not anticipated until some time in 2022 (there are proposals that may move this timeline up)"
10993,2020-12-01 18:00:55+00:00,MessariCrypto,"When an aspiring staker makes a valid deposit of 32 ETH or greater, the Beacon Chain mints an equivalent amount of ETH on the new chain. Validators then start accruing ETH rewards in exchange for their services."
10994,2020-12-01 18:00:54+00:00,MessariCrypto,"What is the deposit contract? 

It's a one-way bridge between Ethereum‚Äôs PoW chain and the Beacon Chain. Currently, there has been over 878,000 ETH (over $530M) staked from over 2,700 unique depositors who have opted to help bootstrap Ethereum‚Äôs proof of stake blockchain."
10995,2020-12-01 18:00:54+00:00,MessariCrypto,"1) a validator‚Äôs ability to remain online and active  
 
2) the amount of ETH that‚Äôs locked in a special contract called the deposit contract."
10996,2020-12-01 18:00:54+00:00,MessariCrypto,"In the meantime, Ethereum applications will continue to run uninterrupted on the original PoW chain.

Despite its limited functionality, the Beacon Chain comes with very real economic implications, as new ETH will be issued to PoS validators based on two variables."
10997,2020-12-01 18:00:54+00:00,MessariCrypto,"Eventually, the Beacon Chain will serve as the central nervous system for the entire Ethereum network. However, upon launch the Beacon Chain‚Äôs primary purpose will just be to bootstrap the new PoS consensus mechanism."
10998,2020-12-01 18:00:53+00:00,MessariCrypto,"If they perform inadequately or maliciously, they receive reduced rewards and could even risk losing some or all of their stake via a slashing penalty."
10999,2020-12-01 18:00:53+00:00,MessariCrypto,"If a validator performs adequately, mainly by remaining online and participating honestly in consensus, they are rewarded with newly issued ETH and eventually, transaction fees."
11000,2020-12-01 18:00:53+00:00,MessariCrypto,"Where proof of work miners help secure a network by running energy intensive, specialized hardware (ASICs), validators make an economic commitment in the form of 32 ETH and run software that validates new transactions."
11001,2020-12-01 18:00:53+00:00,MessariCrypto,"The Beacon Chain is Ethereum's new blockchain. 

Where Ethereum‚Äôs existing blockchain employs proof of work (PoW) consensus backed by a network of miners, the Beacon Chain employs proof of stake (PoS) consensus backed by a network of validators."
11002,2020-12-01 18:00:52+00:00,MessariCrypto,"Ethereum 2.0 boils down to launching a new blockchain from scratch with a completely new consensus mechanism and architecture, all without disrupting Ethereum‚Äôs existing $100B+ cryptoeconomy."

11022,2020-11-30 16:57:16+00:00,MessariCrypto,"Rollups + ‚ÄúPhase 1.5‚Äù would amount to a ~10,000x+ improvement in network processing capacity over the current state of Ethereum."
11023,2020-11-30 16:57:16+00:00,MessariCrypto,"Rollups are a type of layer 2 scaling technology that process transactions independently of the Ethereum blockchain, but settle snapshots of their state to the main chain."
11024,2020-11-30 16:57:15+00:00,MessariCrypto,"However, this phase may end up being unnecessary with phases 0-1.5 and the adoption of a layer-2 scaling technique called ‚Äúrollups.‚Äù"
11025,2020-11-30 16:57:15+00:00,MessariCrypto,"Phase 2 (that may never happen)

The final phase of Ethereum 2.0, involves unlocking smart contract execution across some or all the Beacon Chain‚Äôs 64 shards. Additionally, Phase 2 may introduce a new virtual machine."
11026,2020-11-30 16:57:15+00:00,MessariCrypto,"However, this will not take place until some time in 2022, so the earliest point in which the average Ethereum user today interacts with Ethereum 2.0 is at least one year away."
