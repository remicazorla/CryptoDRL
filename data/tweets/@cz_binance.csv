@jespow uses the word “offshore” quite often. Here is my feedback.
 
The term “offshore” appears overly narrow-minded, self-centered, misses the broader picture and unhelpful to the development of our industry.

The market votes with their feet, not decentralization idealism.

Increase your user base, increase adoption."
6102,2019-02-25 18:15:51+00:00,cz_binance,"Like to think we contributed to the adoption, maybe just a tiny bit, lol.  Congratulations #XRP!

The more adoption, the better, and the faster thing move around the world.  It's spreading."
6103,2019-02-24 15:30:32+00:00,cz_binance,"We seen ATH for trading system load about an hour ago, some users experienced ui delays during system auto scaling.  Still improving."
6104,2019-02-24 02:40:27+00:00,cz_binance,"Disagree on this one. Humans can use crypto equally well. 

The reason it is so hard for many to understand cryptocurrency is because our schools don't teach us what money really is."

6108,2019-02-19 16:28:32+00:00,cz_binance,"Is it just me? Or are we getting more excited at 4K than 20k? 

Nothing wrong with that, makes total sense. 

Just not used to so many messages on Twitter all of a sudden, it’s been a while."
6109,2019-02-19 11:55:39+00:00,cz_binance,1 day till the @binance_dex testnet release!

Someone asked me about credit card withdrawals on the AMA, here you go.  #CarefulWhatYouWishFor with @Binance.

Thank you @SpendCard"

6115,2019-02-12 12:54:08+00:00,cz_binance,XRP purchasing using a credit card is working now.  Slowly but surely.
6116,2019-02-12 05:07:02+00:00,cz_binance,"Finally got a date.  Targeting to release Binance Chain testnet (@binance_dex) for public testing on Feb 20th.  This is a testnet, your feedback would be most valuable."
6117,2019-02-11 05:50:32+00:00,cz_binance,"Apparently, I hold the torch now.  #LNTrustChain  

I must say, it feels very cool in my virtual hand. :)  Who should I send it to next?"

6122,2019-02-06 08:43:57+00:00,cz_binance,Many thanks to @CoinMarketCap for updating the $BNB circulating supply.  Doing ranking is much much harder than people imagine.  Keep up the good work!

6126,2019-02-03 15:36:48+00:00,cz_binance,I guess simple math proves crypto have nothing to do with it.
6127,2019-02-02 13:36:22+00:00,cz_binance,"For any internet (non-physical) based business, I don't understand why anyone would not accept crypto for payments.  It is easier, faster and cheaper to integration than traditional payment gateways.  Less paperwork.  And reaches more diverse demographic and geography."
6128,2019-02-02 12:58:07+00:00,cz_binance,"That's sad. There are many solutions to split private keys or signing to achieve 3/5, 5/7 etc.  Never neglect security.

Also, never have CEO carry private keys.  Bad on many levels. 

Personally, in good health and intent to live longer and prosper. Thx for asking.  Stay #safu."
6129,2019-01-31 12:26:36+00:00,cz_binance,"Buy crypto with your credit card!
