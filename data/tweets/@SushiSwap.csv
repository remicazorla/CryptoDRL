Why is my xSUSHI balance lower than my Sushi balance?

When you stake your SUSHI tokens, you “purchase” a share of the xSUSHI pool. Because xSUSHI appreciates in value compared to SUSHI, the amount of xSUSHI you get for your SUSHI decreases overtime."

539,2022-03-23 08:00:06+00:00,SushiSwap,"2.

Funds in Bentobox can be used for flash loans to generate a small fee, thus generating extra yield. Idle funds can be deployed by ""Strategies"" contracts, too. These contracts can help to generate extra yield by sending the idle assets to low risk protocols like the SushiBar."
540,2022-03-23 07:59:48+00:00,SushiSwap,"1.

In simple terms, Bentobox is like an Operating System powering your phone and Sushi’s products such as Trident https://t.co/lU36gMnkus , Limit Order https://t.co/SwXERhPnVm , or Kashi https://t.co/Dh7mz5GPm2 are the apps. Bento’s modularity brings a number of benefits:"

The proposal originally made by @ 0xMaki and executed by Sushi core team member, @ lufy, really shows the power of community, the power of governance and the power of dedicated contributors and it is something that should be celebrated."
652,2021-10-23 01:25:35+00:00,SushiSwap,"5/

The step that the community took to preserve the Sushi ecosystem and instill value to its governance token, resulted in a collaboration that generated over $800 million of sheer wealth and helped to establish Sushi as a DeFi blue-chip in a mere 6 months."
653,2021-10-23 01:25:34+00:00,SushiSwap,"4/

The community rallied behind a proposal that actually prevented them from doing what they liked to do most: Immediately sell their harvested $SUSHI rewards! 
https://t.co/VbtUdbmSPe

From September 29, 2020 all rewards were to be vested for 6 months."
654,2021-10-23 01:25:34+00:00,SushiSwap,"3/

With payouts as high as they were, Sushi farmers had one thing in common: As soon as rewards were harvested, they immediately sold. 

This was good for the farmers, but bad for the farm and the $SUSHI price was suffering. 

Something had to be done to reduce sell pressure."
655,2021-10-23 01:25:33+00:00,SushiSwap,"2/

Sushi reward farming began on August 28, 2020 and was critical to the protocol growth, as it was a major incentive to draw from other liquidity mining programs.

With sky high APYs, there was a DeFi flippening, as Sushi overtook Uni in TVL in less than a week!

Great, right?"
