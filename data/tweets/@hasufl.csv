1,2023-02-26 10:26:50+00:00,hasufl,"@storytruths for that reason I think the trend toward later token is extremely healthy for this market. it forces projects to think about making an actual product, not a token as the product"

1. security = guess what, actually less secure than options like rollup, restaking, etc.
2. fees = guess what, actually worse UX for users than paying fees in ETH or stables"

1. OGs get richer ‚Äî because companies take longer to go public?

2. virtual signaling gets louder ‚Äî do you mean for ETH? in our case, has 0 to do w signaling and everything with you just don‚Äôt need a token to launch a new chain initially"

458,2022-11-27 16:53:28+00:00,hasufl,@AlgodTrading IMO this is the type of situation where an industry cannot self-regulate and benefits from an external party (usually the govt) coming in a creating the same rule for everyone.

What actually happened was that B made *two* channels, one with A where they controlled B and E. And one with E where they controlled A and B.

This approach has some amazing properties:
A) savers backstop security but ONLY when demand from users is not high to pay for it
B) the network never spends more on mining than a target amount"
2858,2021-10-31 18:04:42+00:00,hasufl,"@Mario_Gibney EIP-1559 + perpetual inflation actually pairs the best parts of *both* of the possible forks you mention:

2862,2021-10-31 12:49:28+00:00,hasufl,"There is still possibility of borrowing stables against the tokens without making them available for lending. Due to lack of time, I will leave this scenario as an exercise to the reader :)"
2863,2021-10-31 12:49:28+00:00,hasufl,"3) Could projects put their treasury tokens into lending markets instead?

Proponents of this seem to expect a kind of ‚Äûfree lunch‚Äú that in my view doesn‚Äòt really exist. Your tokens only earn a yield if someone borrows them, which dilutes the supply as much as selling it."
2864,2021-10-31 12:49:27+00:00,hasufl,"This is definitely true and could be counted as an asset to the protocol itself. But counting it also raises some further questions:

a) Could a maintainer company be banned from continuing work on the protocol? If yes, what happens then?"
2865,2021-10-31 12:49:26+00:00,hasufl,"2) Should we count maintainer company balance sheets, and if yes, how?

To give an example, we said that Uniswap‚Äòs treasury is empty. But in practice, it is maintained by Uniswap Labs, which has raised several rounds of capital and might have years of runway left."
2866,2021-10-31 12:49:26+00:00,hasufl,Gnosis even has a huge treasury ($750m+) but at this size I would rather give that as an example of a product DAO that accidentally slipped into the investment DAO mindset - something we explicitly caution against in the article.
2867,2021-10-31 12:49:26+00:00,hasufl,"It is hence of much higher important that product DAOs manage their treasury well!

That said, there are some projects that fall into the product DAO category that deserve a shoutout: Keeper, Yearn, Synthetix, and Badger DAOs all have above-average treasuries."
2868,2021-10-31 12:49:25+00:00,hasufl,"I don‚Äòt mean that in negative way - you just cannot compare an investment DAO to a product DAO. If dxDAO disappeared tomorrow, no one except their investors would notice. 

But if Maker + Dai disappeared, tens if not hundreds of thousands of users would be affected."
2869,2021-10-31 12:49:25+00:00,hasufl,"1) The one on most people‚Äòs mind: Why didn‚Äòt we mention projects like Ohm, BitDAO, NounsDAO etc.? 

Simple, we were writing about projects that use a treasury + token as a tool to build a product for users, not projects where the treasury + token is the product."

So humans create institutions like moral codes/religion, a monopoly on violence, the legal system, markets, money, etc. to establish trust between participants and lower transaction costs."

4078,2021-09-02 09:13:44+00:00,hasufl,"Summary: I posited that EIP-1559 effectively batches many txns, breaking the way searchers used to express ordering preferences in a PGA. Do you agree/disagree? Share your thoughts"
4079,2021-09-02 09:13:43+00:00,hasufl,"So bundles will always be invented, only question is they are invented as a private/proprietary sidechannel between some searchers/miners or globally available for all. So IMO futile to long for a pre-bundle world."
4080,2021-09-02 09:13:43+00:00,hasufl,"c) We naively assumed that there are no bundles, but this thread shows by both searchers and miners 
*want* this txn type to exist. When they can communicate exact ordering preferences, the total value of the block goes up, at the expense of the users."
4081,2021-09-02 09:13:43+00:00,hasufl,"b) If it‚Äòs first-seen, backrunning changes from a bidding war to a latency war. Think a seeing a 1 gwei txn and then immediately sending the miner your own 1 gwei txn as well. So backrunning MEV only changes but isn‚Äòt removed."
4082,2021-09-02 09:13:42+00:00,hasufl,"However: 
a) It depends on how miners group their txns. Standard used to be by gas price, but what breaks the tie between same price txns? Can either be randomized or first-seen."
4083,2021-09-02 09:13:42+00:00,hasufl,"4. If the above were true (and remember only PGAs no bundles), then EIP-1559 would effectively lead to batch settlement instead of ordering by gas price which makes front/backrunning harder."
4084,2021-09-02 09:13:42+00:00,hasufl,"3. as a front/backrunner, how do you communicate your target position to miners? Using less gwei would put you behind the entire batch (bad case) or even out of the block entirely (worst case). Using more gwei would put you ahead of the entire batch (bad case)"
4085,2021-09-02 09:13:41+00:00,hasufl,"One for my MEV friends: I always said that EIP-1559 has no impact on MEV, but is that true? Assume we are still in PGA world and no bundles

1. in EIP-1559, the goal is for many txns to have the same priority fee (1-2 gwei, wallet default)

4191,2021-08-30 10:23:34+00:00,hasufl,@0xtuba @gakonst Since in Ethereum we have a gossip protocol and the next leader has no special role in that (they aren‚Äòt known in advance due to PoW lottery). And so we have to inform every node of every txn

Regarding Erigon's motive, I am now convinced that they support EGL with the same goal - to increase the gas limit.

Why? Because Erigon devs think their client (ex Turbo-geth) could handle much more throughput than Geth, which they argue is holding Ethereum back. https://t.co/rysh29Eb0U"

This is ofc total nonsense because high propagation time reflects itself in high uncle rates and we are not seeing that. The real bottleneck for the gas limit is state growth &amp; other negative externalities."

2) The larger the blocks, the longer they take to propagate, the more miners need BDN to stay competitive. The more money Bloxroute makes.

This is in line with Uri's previous comments, e.g. that the key to solving scalability is on the p2p layer."

4668,2021-08-11 18:02:07+00:00,hasufl,@ameensol namely that Dai should have never added USDC collateral. but then Dai just loses the market to USDC and USDT anyway and the systemic outcome for Ethereum is the exact same or worse.

4880,2021-08-05 18:19:09+00:00,hasufl,@2JohnGodden the political power of ETH holders. why would they accept an increase in inflation w/o good reason?
4881,2021-08-05 18:12:37+00:00,hasufl,"@megazen66 @nic__carter The fee you pay is set by supply and demand in the gas/blockspace market. EIP-1559 does neither lower nor increase that, it's completely orthogonal."
4882,2021-08-05 18:04:12+00:00,hasufl,@TimBeiko @nic__carter think Nic's question makes sense if you reframe it as ETH holders extracting security (not money/fees) from transactors.
4883,2021-08-05 18:01:08+00:00,hasufl,"@nic__carter yeah in the future could see a ""transactor lobby"" forming. but today it doesn't exist"

4885,2021-08-05 17:58:05+00:00,hasufl,@niceplz Pretty sure this greatly estimates the tip neccesary
4886,2021-08-05 17:55:44+00:00,hasufl,@JeremyRubin @nic__carter @TimBeiko is more security budget always better?
4887,2021-08-05 17:54:29+00:00,hasufl,@nic__carter @TimBeiko I'm still not sure I understand. why would transactors (many of who are eth holders btw) care who receives their fees - miners or holders?
4888,2021-08-05 17:53:02+00:00,hasufl,"No, if you want to transact, here's what you should do:

1) look up recent basefee, e.g. on Etherscan
2) set your gasPrice as basefee + 1-2 gwei (as tip)
3) send"
4889,2021-08-05 17:50:26+00:00,hasufl,@nic__carter what market would reject this? miners?
4890,2021-08-05 17:48:22+00:00,hasufl,@bcmakes Ethereum has also seriously considered giving part of the block reward to a dev/public goods fund around 2y earlier and strongly rejected the possibility. so it wasn't an oversight

4893,2021-08-05 17:43:14+00:00,hasufl,"@bcmakes Personally, I regret not giving that possibility more thought (although a dev fund also needs to be managed and introduces its own centralization vectors). 

Could prob compile a whole list of regrets/reflections about the EIP-1559 process"
4894,2021-08-05 17:40:24+00:00,hasufl,"@BitsBeTrippin @TimBeiko @VitalikButerin Idk who said that, but @gakonst and my model predicted that long-term 20-35% of miner revenue would be burned. On a per-block basis, anything can happen. Also the model can become outdated with changes in the MEV landscape, this stuff is moving fast"
4895,2021-08-05 17:38:02+00:00,hasufl,"@BitsBeTrippin @TimBeiko @VitalikButerin Second, Etherscan also cannot track all forms of miner revenue. This includes both Eden network and some types of Flashbots txns. If it were an Eden block (I did not check), then the first few slots would all show 0 payment to miners, but in reality, it happens off-chain."
4896,2021-08-05 17:36:52+00:00,hasufl,@BitsBeTrippin @TimBeiko @VitalikButerin It's futile to look at individual blocks since MEV isn't equally distributed over time but is very random. So some blocks can have 5% burn while others are gonna have 100%.

4921,2021-08-05 12:53:10+00:00,hasufl,"I should add, given the current level of demand for gas. That is the biggest (and least predictable) factor."
4922,2021-08-05 12:52:15+00:00,hasufl,"Don't expect the current burn rate to cont forever:
1) not all miners have started mining 30m blocks yet, so we're not at max capacity
2) once the mempool has been cleared entirely (which should happen any moment now), blocks will become smaller and basefee will fall again"
4923,2021-08-05 12:44:25+00:00,hasufl,"Miners can now mine blocks up to 30m gas. As long as they are &gt;15m, basefee will keep rising."

5045,2021-07-28 14:38:37+00:00,hasufl,"@SamuelShadrach4 @TheStalwart @gakonst This is unproven. Yes, delegated staking introduces a principal-agent problem. However, in a world with delegated staking, the amount of ETH staked will also be much higher because the oppt. cost is lower. So an attacker has to capture more ETH to cause a system fault"

If 100% of ETH is staked, nobody‚Äòs share of ETH goes up, right? So is staking all risk/no reward because of that? 

No, because you have to compare it to the alternative of holding ETH and getting diluted because you don‚Äòt stake."

These proofs of work must be
1) costly to make
2) provable on-chain
3) interpretable by a smart contract"

5056,2021-07-28 13:57:10+00:00,hasufl,"@brendanwoodcock @TheStalwart Since the validators in Lido are professional firms with strong historic track record, the slashing risk is probably a fair bit lower than if you solo-staked. I was comparing to holding ETH in your wallet w/o staking."

5067,2021-07-28 12:27:21+00:00,hasufl,@OisinKyne @thegostep Fast forward 5 years and I think most people will hold ETH in (non-custodial) banks where they passively accrue interest from being put to work in the Defi economy.

5221,2021-07-20 13:07:57+00:00,hasufl,"A few days ago I questioned whether Sushiswap should even try to build their own swap technology w/o a strong research partner, or rather license an existing solution. They chose the third option I didn‚Äòt see, which is to reimplement them instead."
5222,2021-07-20 12:58:45+00:00,hasufl,"I first thought Sushi was simply introducing three new static curves, but instead they copied the other big AMMs w/o forking them (at least in Uni‚Äòs case to respect the license)

And they are bundling these new pools with Bentobox and a new router (which are Sushi innovations)"
5223,2021-07-20 12:58:44+00:00,hasufl,"Okay, after reading the post, it turns out that the three new pool types are actually reimplementations of
1) Uniswap v3 (concentrated liquidity)
2) Curve v1 (I think - they say based on stableswap invariant, and no oracle used)
3) Balancer v2 (weighted pools)"

5226,2021-07-20 12:41:00+00:00,hasufl,Overall the talk was very light on details on the actual curves used. Hoping for a followup post soon.
5227,2021-07-20 12:38:28+00:00,hasufl,"3) some mix between xy=k but a bit more concentrated and gas-efficient
- Up to 32 assets per pool, weighting possible (basically like Balancer)
- new factory allowing more pool types to be added in the future"
5228,2021-07-20 12:38:28+00:00,hasufl,"Summary:
- new AMMs will be inside Bentobox, where idle assets can be used by yield farming strategies. No surprise there
- 3 new pool types.
1) concentrated liquidity
2) ‚Äûhybrid‚Äú which Joe said is for stablecoins.. bit confusing, expected this for the previous type"

6017,2021-06-09 01:04:19+00:00,hasufl,@Ndub1234 It does affect your security!
6018,2021-06-09 01:02:52+00:00,hasufl,"@Bquittem That‚Äòs the one I‚Äòm least sure about, but if Bitcoin leans into the buy-and-hold usecase, then it shouldn‚Äòt half-ass it and instead do that as well as possible. If that means making transacting on L1 a lot more expensive, 100% fine with me"

6020,2021-06-09 00:58:13+00:00,hasufl,"@nic__carter What, why"
6021,2021-06-09 00:57:14+00:00,hasufl,"@Bquittem L2 + sidechains:
- Give the LN folks every oppose they want, and do it yesterday
- BIP 300 + 301 for drivechain + RSK

- covenants

Privacy:
- sig aggregation
- CT"
6022,2021-06-09 00:53:40+00:00,hasufl,"@Bquittem Good question, would take me a bit to compile a full wishlist! Obviously I would most like more versatile smart contracts, but if we leave these aside for a moment, there are plenty of optimizations just around the use of SoV + payment as well"

6027,2021-06-09 00:38:28+00:00,hasufl,"@TeamBitcoin Nobody said there‚Äòs no tradeoffs, but some are worth making."
6028,2021-06-09 00:35:53+00:00,hasufl,"In short, I think it‚Äòs possible that the exhausting years of 2014-2017 have caused a sort of ‚Äûgovernance PTSD‚Äú that raised the bar for incremental but meaningful improvements to Bitcoin even higher than it was before."
6029,2021-06-09 00:30:59+00:00,hasufl,"@itsminawhile @wtogami How do you generate fees on Bitcoin if the BTC sit in custody, and you transfer with WBTC on Ethereum?"
6030,2021-06-09 00:30:00+00:00,hasufl,"So, large blockers lost because they ended up on a dying fork. That‚Äòs obvious.

But is it possible that small blockers also lost?

Bitcoin‚Äòs last soft fork was over 4 (!) years ago, and the road to Taproot - a tiny improvement in the scheme of things - has been excruciating."
6031,2021-06-09 00:17:55+00:00,hasufl,@O80925253 Maybe it is you who changed?
6032,2021-06-09 00:16:40+00:00,hasufl,@wtogami The bitcoin OGs knew this and tried to create social norms around validation (protection from miner attacks) and self-custody (protection from regulatory attacks on exchanges).
6033,2021-06-09 00:15:43+00:00,hasufl,"@wtogami This is the thinking that I try to challenge in my article (linked in the thread above). As a bitcoin holder, you are *not* immune from the choices of other bitcoin holders, as they affect security of the whole."

6035,2021-06-09 00:09:25+00:00,hasufl,@Espicious1 @kyletorpey @udiWertheimer @SovrynBTC @hodlhodl @EdanYago I don‚Äòt mean that in a negative way btw. I would not use a completely new AMM or lending protocol. The ability to fork battle-hardened stuff is extremely important. But it‚Äòs also no coincidence that this stuff was first built on Ethereum and not RSK
6036,2021-06-09 00:07:08+00:00,hasufl,What if Bitcoin actually lost the block size war? ü§î
6037,2021-06-09 00:04:14+00:00,hasufl,@kyletorpey @udiWertheimer @SovrynBTC @hodlhodl Why did it take another few years after Ethereum to launch Sovyrn (which is btw a copy-paste job)? Give me your best guess
6038,2021-06-08 23:59:29+00:00,hasufl,@kyletorpey @udiWertheimer @SovrynBTC @hodlhodl Ethereum‚Äòs design has enabled a huge amount of economic activity and innovation that wouldn‚Äòt have been able on Bitcoin. That doesn‚Äòt ‚Äûjustify‚Äú (not that they have to justify it to begin with) the creation of a new token?
6039,2021-06-08 23:55:59+00:00,hasufl,"@udiWertheimer @adanthar I don‚Äòt mind sidechains, I just wish there was more reason to use them. Unfortunately, there are strong social forces in Bitcoin that make building the critical mass of users+capital very difficult."
6040,2021-06-08 23:53:05+00:00,hasufl,"@kyletorpey @udiWertheimer @SovrynBTC @hodlhodl I find it a very difficult to understand view why Bitcoin has the right to ‚Äûmint a new money‚Äú but Ethereum and other coins don‚Äòt. Is free market competition for money supposed to end after the invention of Bitcoin? The way see it, it is only beginning."
6041,2021-06-08 23:50:09+00:00,hasufl,@udiWertheimer Thanks for clarifying. IMO this logic doesn‚Äòt make sense since WBTC is not trustless. It‚Äòs just a different form of BTC on an exchange. You have to compare it to ETH used in Defi vs ETH used on CEX. Then you get the real demand to use trustless vs trusted finance.
6042,2021-06-08 23:46:56+00:00,hasufl,@kyletorpey @udiWertheimer @SovrynBTC @hodlhodl By new money do you mean ETH?
6043,2021-06-08 23:46:14+00:00,hasufl,"@adanthar @udiWertheimer I don‚Äòt have your optimism that this would change when Bitcoin is in trouble, and if it does, then probably not without said decade-long battle"
6044,2021-06-08 23:44:20+00:00,hasufl,"@adanthar @udiWertheimer Yeah, Udi your response reminds me strongly of ‚ÄûBitcoin will eventually adopt any good features pioneered on other chains.‚Äú Today, we know that Bitcoin will exactly adopt 0 good features pioneered on other chains, and not because there are none, but because of governance fatigue"
6045,2021-06-08 23:41:45+00:00,hasufl,"@udiWertheimer Can you explain why you would care about that metric? Because CEX deposits &gt; bridge deposits show that people don‚Äôt value non-custodial finance? But that can‚Äòt be, because bridges are not non-custodial either. Likewise, what would bridge &gt; CEX deposits prove?"
6046,2021-06-08 23:36:38+00:00,hasufl,@kyletorpey @udiWertheimer I think this is fundamentally wrong. A non-custodial lending market that relies on an oracle is still more secure than a custodial lending market relying on that same oracle.
6047,2021-06-08 23:32:54+00:00,hasufl,@udiWertheimer @DzambhalaHODL Maybe that was unnecessary üòá
6048,2021-06-08 23:32:18+00:00,hasufl,"@DzambhalaHODL @udiWertheimer Definitely not saying that every user of other chains is a disgruntled former BTC user. Just that this is exactly where you would find disgruntled BTC users, blended in with the rest. It‚Äòs not like there is another option"
6049,2021-06-08 23:29:55+00:00,hasufl,"@btcdentist @udiWertheimer You can leave anytime, or I can take decision from you if you prefer"
6050,2021-06-08 23:29:17+00:00,hasufl,"@MachiOtah @udiWertheimer If you don‚Äòt believe the quantitative answer - I am now more interested in Ethereum than Bitcoin because of Defi. I think a chain‚Äôs ability to support a Defi ecosystem around its native token is extremely valuable, and closes many attack vectors. That‚Äòs your quantitative answer."
6051,2021-06-08 23:24:32+00:00,hasufl,"@econguy123 @udiWertheimer People have been saying for years that ‚Äûsmart contracts will be built on L2‚Äú. Based on my knowledge, building even simple applications on LN is devilish hard, and even those are fundamentally less expressive than Ethereum."
6052,2021-06-08 23:18:36+00:00,hasufl,"@udiWertheimer Every sane person will compare the two options: 1) Push for smart contracts on BTC, which is 10year+ lobbying effort and even then still has a large chance of failure, or 2) just pack up and leave.

You don‚Äòt observe 1), and conclude lack of demand? That‚Äòs truly wild"
6053,2021-06-08 23:16:01+00:00,hasufl,@udiWertheimer So how would that look like? Everybody thinks that Bitcoin‚Äòs core design is set in stone forever. Last soft fork was 4 (!!!!) years ago. Massive political debates about activating a virtually meaningless feature like Taproot.
6054,2021-06-08 23:14:26+00:00,hasufl,"@udiWertheimer You, on the other hand, argue that instead of just leaving (and/or taking their BTC with them via trusted bridges), they would somehow ‚Äûexpress demand‚Äú to implement these things on BTC."
6055,2021-06-08 23:13:03+00:00,hasufl,@udiWertheimer This is exactly what you would expect if the market wanted something (in this case L1 smart contracts) and couldn‚Äòt get it from Bitcoin.
6056,2021-06-08 23:11:11+00:00,hasufl,"@udiWertheimer I have no idea how you can be so confident what the market wants wrt Bitcoin. 
1) BTC dominance vs other L1 chains in secular downtrend
2) Smart contract chains beat Bitcoin on every metric: active users, volume settled, fees, etc. 
3) More and more BTC tokenized on other chains"
6057,2021-06-08 23:02:33+00:00,hasufl,"@rocket_fuel_ @udiWertheimer That is an extremely high bar, and hence would disprove Udi‚Äòs thesis entirely"

The exact opposite is true: 

You need to fork the chain to MAKE an invalid state transition (by changing the rules to make it valid)"

6900,2021-05-18 14:01:21+00:00,hasufl,@funky_junky_ The problem is self-custody + difficult to trace + bearer asset. The perfect setup for a robbery.

6906,2021-05-18 12:44:59+00:00,hasufl,"Using a smart contract wallet allows me to define all kinds of spending conditions around daily amounts, trusted addresses and applications.

E.g. I can immediately sign a Uniswap trade to my own address, but not to any external address w/o signing from several of my guardians."

* friends/family
* other hardware devices that you control
* your email+phone number (via Argent Guardian service)

A majority of them can replace your signer key."
6908,2021-05-18 12:44:59+00:00,hasufl,"So if you ever want to change the signer key (e.g. because your phone was lost/stolen/replaced), then you have to tell the smart-contract to update its signer key. This is where the social recovery part (via the guardians) comes in:"
6909,2021-05-18 12:44:58+00:00,hasufl,"A smart-contract wallet, as the name suggests, is an on-chain contract. It has one signer key and several guardians (think of those as an on-demand multi-sig setup).

The signer key is generated in the Secure Enclave of your phone, and it can never leave from there. https://t.co/FTyOXMssUN"
6910,2021-05-18 12:44:57+00:00,hasufl,"My workflow:
1) Establish an encrypted channel between Argent and a Defi app via Walletconnect. This only needs to be done once for each app.
2) Make all my txns on desktop
3) Review and sign the txn on the Argent mobile app, which acts as a 2FA"
6911,2021-05-18 12:44:56+00:00,hasufl,"I would consider myself a power user of Argent and have onboarded several friends to become power users themselves.

7445,2021-04-29 09:50:50+00:00,hasufl,"This shows how txn costs are affected by all three factors: gas cost (changes rarely/never), gas price (fluctuates due to supply/demand), and ETH price (fluctuates due to supply/demand)"
7446,2021-04-29 09:48:28+00:00,hasufl,"The way I tend to explain it is

Txns have a cost in gas (a ficticious resource)
Users bid for gas in Ether's smallest unit gwei.
Ether has a price in USD

Example: 
ERC-20 Transfer takes 21k gas
1 gas costs 50 gwei
21k gas cost 1,05m gwei
1,05m gwei = 0,0105 ETH = $28"

7555,2021-04-27 14:12:19+00:00,hasufl,@Heisinator Running a SOL validator also requires you to stake some SOL (I assume?). So I'd rather just compare the hardware and bandwidth costs alone. But I hear you that both of those could well be quite low relative to the required minimum stake.
7556,2021-04-27 14:10:13+00:00,hasufl,The hardware cost is not that big. I think we reached a consensus in the other thread that it's about $2.5-3k.
7557,2021-04-27 14:08:10+00:00,hasufl,@pantsueff @LefterisJP @lemiscate Would be curious to know the bandwidth requirements. Those must be the real bottleneck.

7566,2021-04-27 13:45:36+00:00,hasufl,@iamDCinvestor @0xNaut You currently need $80k to participate in Ethereum as a solo validator. Does $3k hardware cost (which is btw not that much higher than in Ethereum post-merge) really make a big difference?

7655,2021-04-26 00:07:23+00:00,hasufl,"@lightcoin @Evan_ss6 Maybe that's true for a small number of people today. But all holders of WBTC, renBTC, TBTC, sBTC etc. on Ethereum would disagree."
7656,2021-04-26 00:05:49+00:00,hasufl,"@lightcoin @Evan_ss6 Do you see what I'm trying to say? They aren't ""on bitcoin"" because they have no access to bitcoin's state, it's users, wallets, etc.
Just making a new ""bitcoin-friendly"" but empty blockchain doesn't give you anything"
7657,2021-04-26 00:02:10+00:00,hasufl,"@rob_mose @lightcoin @Evan_ss6 You're confusing cause and effect. Tbtc requires trustless collateral to already exist, it doesn't monetize it"
7658,2021-04-25 23:59:37+00:00,hasufl,"@lightcoin @Evan_ss6 I do think it matters a lot that RSK and Stacks are completely new blockchains with an empty and rather valueless state. So while in theory someone could build on them, in practice nobody does because other chains have much more valuable state."
7659,2021-04-25 23:54:13+00:00,hasufl,"@lightcoin @Evan_ss6 I don't understand PoX well enough, in what sense is the bridge stronger than WBTC?

That aside, the right comparison isn't BTC on Ethereum vs RSK/Stacks, but ETH and other native tokens vs BTC RSK/Stacks. The security model of the former is much stronger."
7660,2021-04-25 23:46:00+00:00,hasufl,"@lightcoin @Evan_ss6 The difference then is that Stacks has ~0 users, and RSK maybe a few hundred. So in what sense can people build on these platforms when nobody else is there? Having an EVM is a necessary but not sufficient condition. The real value is in the state"
7661,2021-04-25 23:39:08+00:00,hasufl,"@lightcoin @Evan_ss6 Because RSK and Stacks are about as much ""on bitcoin"" as Ethereum itself is - they utilize more or less trusted token bridges to import BTC, similar to WBTC/renBTC"

7841,2021-04-21 21:41:13+00:00,hasufl,@calebsheridan @bertcmiller @Evan_ss6 I know. Uniswap shows me an expected amount of tokens and a minimum amount of tokens. The min amount is controlled via slippage tolerance.

7849,2021-04-21 21:11:26+00:00,hasufl,"@bertcmiller If you made a hypothetical trade with Archer that has 1% slippage tolerance, I think you'd fully expect to get sandwiched.

7850,2021-04-21 21:09:37+00:00,hasufl,"@bertcmiller I can also set slippage tolerance to 0 without using Archer (and in fact, I frequently do). The tradeoff is that my txn will fail more frequently.

7863,2021-04-21 11:31:23+00:00,hasufl,"@richwgalvin @0xtuba @wilburforce_ first point makes a lot of sense to me. what does ""cross a spread"" mean?"
7864,2021-04-21 11:29:41+00:00,hasufl,@sasuke___420 @spocknimoy_xyz @wilburforce_ yeah the network effect of liquidity is very hard to overcome
7865,2021-04-21 11:26:56+00:00,hasufl,@0xtuba @wilburforce_ But that's just a guess from reading a limited amount of the pro/contra HFT debate. I'd love to learn more
7866,2021-04-21 11:25:11+00:00,hasufl,"@0xtuba @wilburforce_ I would say this is how things have grown, and now there's a large financial incentives (HFT firms) against changing the rules for the better"
7867,2021-04-21 10:55:46+00:00,hasufl,"@Lanadeltrade1 @wilburforce_ LP = liquidity provider (market maker)
FIFO = first in first out (the first order in the book is the first to be filled)"
7868,2021-04-21 10:54:44+00:00,hasufl,"This is both healthier for price takers as well as causing significantly fewer negative externalities (MEV, state bloat) than the HFT game."
7869,2021-04-21 10:52:53+00:00,hasufl,"Uniswap v3 can be seen as a limit order book approximation, but one important difference is on any given price movement, LPs are matched pro-rata instead of FIFO (h/t @wilburforce_). This changes the optimal LP strategy from who can be first to who can provide the most liquidity."
7870,2021-04-21 10:16:19+00:00,hasufl,@hexidethmal @cyounessi1 At least initially I think so. That‚Äòs why its important for MEV extraction to become democratized
7871,2021-04-21 09:09:17+00:00,hasufl,"@cyounessi1 After PoS all the MEV will go to stakers, yes. It's a big incentive to delegate to a staking pool or other form of professional validator who optimize for this kind of thing."

7896,2021-04-20 15:15:59+00:00,hasufl,"@CryptoChrisG @bertcmiller I think the best case for crypto, and I've been very consistent in that thesis for years, is that the competition from crypto forces existing institutions (e.g. gov+central bank) to become more user-friendly."
7897,2021-04-20 15:14:11+00:00,hasufl,"@CryptoChrisG @bertcmiller but in reality, many institutions are more agile than they seem and will adapt to the changing tides, including crypto. That's how they have survived in the past. There will never be ""no establishment"", there will just be more crypto people in it. Plebs will remain plebs."
7898,2021-04-20 15:12:37+00:00,hasufl,@CryptoChrisG @bertcmiller I guess my point is many people in crypto are very naive in thinking that crypto will replace all existing institutions and power dynamics. They envision a world where crypto won to be radically different from the past

8556,2021-03-09 12:59:29+00:00,hasufl,"@CursedMining That's why I tried to take a step back here and do exactly that. Ethereum has ""minimum viable issuance"" as its design goal. Is Ethereum in that minimum viable range issuance today, or is it underpaying or overpaying for security?

8601,2021-03-07 11:55:06+00:00,hasufl,@SamuelShadrach4 Of course it's a choice to sell blockspace via an auction mechanism. And why? Because are auctions are known to maximize user welfare. Ethereum could also sell every unit of gas for a constant price. It would just be a terrible system.
8602,2021-03-07 11:46:45+00:00,hasufl,@readyplayeruint @SamuelShadrach4 Who are you talking about?
8603,2021-03-07 11:16:14+00:00,hasufl,"@SamuelShadrach4 All major blockchains are indeed fixing either prices or quantities, and usually both. 
Ethereum:
1) Gas per opcode based on resource consumption
2) Gas limit per block"
8604,2021-03-06 23:29:50+00:00,hasufl,"@sendmoodz It's going to be very difficult for demand to stay above 25m gas for any extended period of time, in most cases I would expect it to dip back down after only a few blocks"
8605,2021-03-06 23:27:14+00:00,hasufl,"@sendmoodz For example, if demand spikes above 25m, then only one block later the basefee will already be 12.5% higher, after 2 blocks it's 27%, after 5 five blocks 80%, after only 10 blocks it's 300%+"
8606,2021-03-06 20:07:52+00:00,hasufl,"This means that 95-99%+ of the time, users will simply be able to pay the quoted price and reliably get their transaction mined in the next block."
8607,2021-03-06 20:06:34+00:00,hasufl,"So this shows it can only happen temporarily at the transition from normal demand -&gt; burst demand. It‚Äôs not possible to know how common FPAs will be in the future, but our intuition is ‚Äúvery rare‚Äù. Most likely sub 5% of all blocks, and probably more like sub 1%."
8608,2021-03-06 20:06:34+00:00,hasufl,"When that happens, the system degrades to the first-price auction we know today. But with every consecutive block mined, basefee will rapidly rise until the point where demand is once again below 25m gas. (Actually, it will keep rising until demand is exacly 12.5m gas)"
8609,2021-03-06 20:06:34+00:00,hasufl,One consequence of this change is that blocks will almost never be full. The only time where this doesn‚Äôt hold is when demand to transact at the current price rises very fast to exceed the new maximum of 2 * the gas target (currently 25m gas).
8610,2021-03-06 20:06:33+00:00,hasufl,"There is still a hard cap set as 2x the current gas target (so 25m gas), but this cap‚Äîcalled the gas limit, same as today‚Äînow only exists to prevent DoS attacks on nodes."
8611,2021-03-06 20:06:33+00:00,hasufl,EIP-1559 *effectively* removes the current fixed cap on quantity and instead fixes the price of transacting. That price‚Äîthe basefee‚Äîupdates automatically to target the same 12.5m quantity of gas consumed as today.
8612,2021-03-06 20:06:33+00:00,hasufl,"To cap the social cost, Ethereum currently puts a hard gas limit of 12.5m on blocks. As of right now, the marginal price of each unit of gas is around 120 Gwei. In other words, at a marginal price of 120 Gwei, there is 12.5m gas worth of demand to transact."
8613,2021-03-06 20:06:32+00:00,hasufl,"First, a quick excursion: Why do blockchains need to put a price on scarce resources anyway?
1) To maximize user welfare (allocate resources to those who gets the most utility from them)
2) To minimize the social cost txns have on other nodes"
8614,2021-03-06 20:06:32+00:00,hasufl,"One of the most common questions we get around EIP-1559 is how predictable the price of getting into the next block will be. Or in other words, how often will you able to pay the current basefee + minimum tip compared to the system degrading to today‚Äôs first-price auction (FPA)?"
8615,2021-03-06 19:18:39+00:00,hasufl,@barnabemonnot I think we should be careful not to confuse ppl even further. &gt;95% of the time you'll be able to bid the absolute minimum tip which is automatically set by your wallet

8752,2021-02-25 01:43:54+00:00,hasufl,"@danfinlay @nicksdjohnson I would put it this way, blockchains are supposed to make some forms of cooperation easy (especially among users) but other forms of cooperation very hard (especially among block producers). If it wasn't that way, they would lose a lot of their security guarantees."
8753,2021-02-25 01:42:06+00:00,hasufl,"@danfinlay It hasn't sailed at all. Users may complain about miners today, but not the point where they sell any ETH or stop transacting/using Defi applications. If either of those happen, miner revenue would suffer much more than it would from cooperation."
8754,2021-02-25 01:26:10+00:00,hasufl,@danfinlay I don't think many people argue miners couldn't implement an MASF if they wanted to. The argument is it would be self-destructive and hence not in their own best interest to do so

9650,2021-01-22 12:13:12+00:00,hasufl,@wintercooled I think we agree then that it means bouncing a check to another user?
9651,2021-01-22 12:11:46+00:00,hasufl,"@wintercooled Never seen anyone compare it to an inflation bug. If that was the case, both the sender + receiver would have the coin and the supply would be inflated. That's clearly not the case in Bitcoin, in a double-spend the transaction is reverted and the same coin is taken back."
9652,2021-01-22 12:10:02+00:00,hasufl,"@wintercooled I also disagree that's a double spend (but yes, that gets to the heart of last couple days' debate) because users can invalidate their own transactions for different reasons without affecting anyone else."
9653,2021-01-22 12:08:44+00:00,hasufl,"@wintercooled Basically my point is, if an actual double-spend happened no user would be comforted by the idea that it wasn't on the same chain but the network collectively switched to a heavier chain that doesn't contain their transaction."

9909,2021-01-15 12:55:24+00:00,hasufl,"@nic__carter And before that, Ethereum itself was bootstrapped via a Bitcoin-based ICO"

9916,2021-01-15 12:34:10+00:00,hasufl,@udiWertheimer @RajarshiMaitra You gave a good counterargument (practicality) but I‚Äòm pretty sure it‚Äòs not all people have in mind who say 1) is great and 2) is bad
9917,2021-01-15 12:28:09+00:00,hasufl,@udiWertheimer @RajarshiMaitra I disagree with none of that.
9918,2021-01-15 12:23:13+00:00,hasufl,"@NeedaShruberry Ah okay. Yes, agree."
9919,2021-01-15 12:19:23+00:00,hasufl,"@NeedaShruberry Transactions aren‚Äòt stored in the token contract anyway. What matters is the STATE (=&gt; who owns how many). You can port that over trivially. If you care about the txn history, that is stored in the blocks."
9920,2021-01-15 12:17:08+00:00,hasufl,"@NeedaShruberry Right, but the legacy token would probably not be seen as YFI (for example) by users, and would get delisted by exchanges while a new YFI pointing at the new contract would get listed

(Such a token migration wouldn‚Äòt be necessary with YFI, just giving an example)"
9921,2021-01-15 12:13:09+00:00,hasufl,"@RajarshiMaitra That‚Äòs where you wrong. There are plenty of objective practical difficulties in taking down Defi applications, even for the SEC. It‚Äòs NOT just security by obscurity."
9922,2021-01-15 12:12:01+00:00,hasufl,"@RajarshiMaitra I agree, and I encourage equally defensive thinking when it comes to applications on Ethereum that could be seen as legal arbitrage (which applies to all of the most interesting ones). If it‚Äôs not costly to take down, it‚Äòs not interesting"
9923,2021-01-15 12:10:29+00:00,hasufl,"@heliben2 And code is never law, it can only make changes more costly. Hope you took that away from the thread. Bitcoin once had an 8 *billion* btc supply inflation bug. Imagine telling yourself that we‚Äòre now stuck with that because ‚Äûcode is law‚Äú"
9924,2021-01-15 12:08:56+00:00,hasufl,"@heliben2 Not really, I think it‚Äôs totally fair to call this ‚Äûrolling back a narrative‚Äú, but that‚Äòs not inherently bad. Social contracts are constantly renegotiated and the people who once pushed for a fixed-cap YFI might not even be the same people who hold YFI today."
9925,2021-01-15 12:07:32+00:00,hasufl,"@heliben2 Yeah most are not designed to be immutable, i.e. the team hasn‚Äòt made it costly to update the supply and the scarcity is not a core reason why people hold the token. Both of those make a lot of sense for *equity* tokens, and would make v little sense for *money* tokens"
9926,2021-01-15 12:05:37+00:00,hasufl,"@NeedaShruberry That‚Äòs the short answer, the nuanced one is that who gets to keep the token ticker is an extremely messy process, especially if some people remain on the old chain/contract and are intent on keeping it alive."
9927,2021-01-15 12:04:56+00:00,hasufl,@NeedaShruberry Is present-day BTC a new token because we once switched to a new blockchain without the 8 billion BTC supply inflation bug?
9928,2021-01-15 11:57:24+00:00,hasufl,"@RajarshiMaitra And Bitcoin hasn‚Äòt survived because enforcers are slow at their job, yeah? You think it has been invulnerable for 12 years?"
9929,2021-01-15 11:56:28+00:00,hasufl,"@udiWertheimer An alternative view is the laws will eventually get updated to accommodate the new innovation as they are no longer enforceable, and it puts the ‚Äûhome team‚Äú at a severe disadvantage."
9930,2021-01-15 11:54:17+00:00,hasufl,"*All* scarcity in blockchains is at its root social, but the technical implementation can still affect how hard it is to change. In Bitcoin, the costs up updating scarcity would be unbearably high. For an Ethereum token that cost is much lower, and that‚Äòs also ok."
9931,2021-01-15 11:54:17+00:00,hasufl,"No, because anyone can make a new version of the token contract and if the community is sufficiently motivated they can migrate over. It‚Äòs the exact same as in Bitcoin: we could all switch to a new version without the supply cap - it‚Äòs just extremely unlikely."
9932,2021-01-15 11:54:16+00:00,hasufl,"Good question, and the answer is both yes and no.

Yes, because a smart contract can be immutable incl. by its creator.  Contracts can be upgradeable (by an admin key or a governance vote) but they don‚Äòt have to. Example: no one can take down or change a Uniswap pool."
9933,2021-01-15 11:43:31+00:00,hasufl,"@udiWertheimer I‚Äòm talking about the app layer on Ethereum fwiw. Not other L1 blockchains, especially not highly centralized ones"
9934,2021-01-15 11:39:38+00:00,hasufl,"@udiWertheimer I think it's all about the marginal cost of taking something down. On Ethereum it can be outside of the founder's own control once sufficiently decentralized, and then it can't be taken down without taking down Ethereum itself"

9936,2021-01-15 11:34:57+00:00,hasufl,"@udiWertheimer Yeah, practicality is a valid response. One reason would be that more projects today have pseudonymous founders and/or are based outside of the US."
9937,2021-01-15 11:32:30+00:00,hasufl,"One consequence from this is, if you're a Bitcoin supporter and frequently say things like ""but isn't x an unregistered security"", maybe you're a cuck"

9953,2021-01-14 23:40:06+00:00,hasufl,"@cyber_hokie @LynAldenContact There are ways for many channels to be updated in the same L1 txn so the users can share the txn fee, and that fee can be higher than any user could individually afford"

9955,2021-01-14 23:27:56+00:00,hasufl,@cyber_hokie @LynAldenContact It's also far more realistic that we'll see sustainable high fees on L1 if those txns are shared by multiple users at once.

9992,2021-01-14 11:42:05+00:00,hasufl,@leokcheng yeah I like that thinking
9993,2021-01-14 11:26:06+00:00,hasufl,"@tansawit @AlphaFinanceLab Right, good point. the high interest rates attracts more liquidity for others to deploy capital they don't currently need."
9994,2021-01-14 11:25:19+00:00,hasufl,"@tansawit @AlphaFinanceLab eh yeah, some lenders/suppliers can't withdraw"
9995,2021-01-14 11:16:41+00:00,hasufl,@mewn21 @bantg can you confirm if I'm on the right track?
9996,2021-01-14 11:16:16+00:00,hasufl,"@mewn21 I think you can program the whitelisted strategy in a way that Cream debt has to be paid back with interest before users can withdraw. When interest enters surge pricing, then vault users could see the vault APY become negative -&gt; they withdraw -&gt; the loan is paid back"
9997,2021-01-14 11:14:25+00:00,hasufl,"@mewn21 I would assume you can't get liquidated as long as your loan is denominated in the asset you borrow. Actually, you should definitely be liquidated before the interest on your loan exceeds user deposits in the yearn vault."
9998,2021-01-14 10:58:43+00:00,hasufl,"With uncollateralized loans, this will no longer be true as parties can only remove liquidity from the protocol. On the flip side, zero collat requirement means the borrower can afford to pay higher interest rates, which in turn will attract more single sided lenders as well."
9999,2021-01-14 10:58:42+00:00,hasufl,6) You'd think that this leads to strictly more borrow/lending volume but I'm not sure yet. The nice thing with overcollateralized loans is that they always add more liquidity to the lending book than they remove as borrowers.
10000,2021-01-14 10:58:42+00:00,hasufl,"5) In general I'm very curious how often the interest is settled, what happens if a protocol exceeds their credit limit, etc."
10001,2021-01-14 10:58:41+00:00,hasufl,"My question would be how this surge pricing interacts with zero collat loans. The interest they owe can rise, but if they only settle once a week, then either some borrowers can't withdraw in the short term or some of the non-whitelisted lenders get extremely rekt"
10002,2021-01-14 10:58:41+00:00,hasufl,4) Cream's interest rate is dynamic and changes as a result of borrow utilization. I think above 80% borrowed the interest rate for borrowers doubles every 8 hours to ensure there's always liquidity for lenders to withdraw
10003,2021-01-14 10:58:40+00:00,hasufl,3) Being whitelisted is a big advantage so maybe to qualify and align incentives future candidates will have to hold CREAM tokens in their treasury.
10004,2021-01-14 10:58:40+00:00,hasufl,"2) Lots of people were speculating what it means for two protocols (such as Yearn X Cream) to ""merge""/partner with each other. This is an unexpected advantage as Yearn vaults will be able to borrow for free."
10005,2021-01-14 10:58:39+00:00,hasufl,"Whitelisted protocols can now borrow from Cream without posting collateral. I have a few thoughts/questions on it

1) pool to protocol loans are a natural first step for uncollateralized loans when the borrowing protocol is itself non-custodial"

10238,2021-01-03 14:17:24+00:00,hasufl,@attmgromov @iamDCinvestor That's true but it still cuts into the profit of holding SNX if you have to sell some to pay back the debt

10241,2021-01-03 14:10:43+00:00,hasufl,"Good way of thinking about SNX staking:

Every sUSD you borrow from Syntethix is not one atomic risk position but two:
1) long sUSD
2) short BTC/ETH/Defi

Makes it clear you need to either hedge 2) or outperform it in other ways."
10242,2021-01-03 14:07:54+00:00,hasufl,"@iamDCinvestor You only get the sUSD by borrowing them from Synthetix. So you're long sUSD and short BTC/ETH/Defi, which makes it extremely risky.

Staking is VERY dangerous in a bull market because the majority of all OI is long BTC/ETH/Defi and stakers take the other side of this. https://t.co/eKWfX3lm20"
10249,2021-01-03 13:56:10+00:00,hasufl,"This tweet underrepresents the risk in SNX staking

If you had minted sUSD against your SNX, you would have lost 12% of that value in December 2020 because you're exposed to the debt pool.

Meanwhile, you received 1.0% sUSD from trading fees and 1.7% in 1-year-vested SNX rewards."

11361,2020-11-05 13:43:47+00:00,hasufl,@VitalikButerin @drakefjustin Imo both the stakers in these pools and exchanges want as much liquidity as possible on their shares. So are incentivized to brand them not as ‚Äûpool shares‚Äú but as a different version of ETH.

11963,2020-10-11 12:40:15+00:00,hasufl,@paddypisa Agree it's not the only solution and certainly not the one we are looking for in the long run.
11964,2020-10-11 12:37:52+00:00,hasufl,@paddypisa The key insight is that MEV is fundamentally a result of decentralization not of centralization. The difficult part is to prevent MEV while still keep block production in general decentralized.
11965,2020-10-11 12:32:59+00:00,hasufl,"@paddypisa You answer it in your first tweet. If MEV leads to the downfall of Ethereum, that implies users would prefer a chain where ordering is completely fair (realistic assumption imo) and take their revenue there. One centralized block producer can guarantee that."
11966,2020-10-11 12:28:03+00:00,hasufl,@paddypisa That's why one of the solutions for MEV is centralizing the sequencing process
11967,2020-10-11 12:27:06+00:00,hasufl,"@paddypisa It's the complete opposite. If mining was centralized, they could optimize revenue over the long-run and ban MEV.

13290,2020-08-30 00:13:49+00:00,hasufl,"@least_nathan personally, I think supporting multiple tokens is a great benefit, not just for fees, but also because it can make the native token MORE rather than less useful. for example, because that allows you to have DEXs rather than CEXs"
13291,2020-08-30 00:11:56+00:00,hasufl,"@least_nathan it exacerbates it in the sense that when users handle multiple tokens, you create demand among them to use these tokens to pay fees (e.g. so they can hold USDT only without also holding ZEC for fees)"
13292,2020-08-30 00:10:54+00:00,hasufl,@least_nathan so the answer would be: it's a concern when AE is used so much that it has a strong effect on token price - not really before that.
13293,2020-08-30 00:10:25+00:00,hasufl,"@least_nathan but to answer the question, EA is a concern because the native token needs to be valuable in order for public blockchains to securely support a lot of economic activity.

when you hold activity constant but make the token lose its value, the system can lose its security"
13294,2020-08-30 00:08:35+00:00,hasufl,"@least_nathan to clarify, by economic abstraction you mean = people pay fees in the non-native currency?

outside of transaction accelerators (which are only used at a tiny scale) I'm not aware of any such economic abstraction happening in Bitcoin or Zcash."

14348,2020-07-10 20:54:25+00:00,hasufl,@SGBarbour I think you make the same mistake as @danheld by looking at fees in $ terms. It ignores that the security bought by each $ in fees depends on the price of Bitcoin and the level of economic activity.

14740,2020-06-26 14:37:26+00:00,hasufl,"Even Blockstream calls this a trusted system AND a sidechain, so what‚Äôs their new working definition? Simple: a sidechain is now any chain of blocks. Let that sink in."
14741,2020-06-26 14:37:26+00:00,hasufl,"Further, there‚Äôs a second federation of 3 (think: admin keys) after consensus has stalled for two weeks. Since it needs 11 of 15 operators to make a new block, 5 of them can stall the blockchain indefinitely, and then 2 of 3 admins can steal your coins as well."
14742,2020-06-26 14:37:25+00:00,hasufl,"They did this by launching Liquid with a closed federation of 15 block producers rather than an open PoW chain. In this system, 11 of 15 operators can steal your coins at any time."
14743,2020-06-26 14:37:25+00:00,hasufl,Now you could think that the idea of the sidechain died together with the hope for this script extension. But this is not what happened: Blockstream simply relaxed the definition of a sidechain so it no longer needs to be trustless.

14754,2020-06-26 12:28:18+00:00,hasufl,"@dankrad @gakonst Relying on exit games is not safe whenever most users can‚Äôt withdraw within your exit window. The way I think about it, congestion-control can isolate your exit window from unexpected stuff happening elsewhere on the chain."
14755,2020-06-26 12:25:56+00:00,hasufl,"@dankrad @gakonst If it needs years worth of block space, then congestion-control does not help you here."
14756,2020-06-26 12:22:28+00:00,hasufl,"@dankrad The reason is that while gas prices are &gt;y, more and more supply is unlocked until eventually prices are back &lt;y and the chain has soaked up all the excess demand."
14757,2020-06-26 12:21:20+00:00,hasufl,"@dankrad In the simplest form, it‚Äôs a problem of ‚Äúcan all users withdraw who want to withdraw?‚Äù. So it‚Äôs both. Inflexible demand meeting inflexible supply makes gas prices explode. With congestion-control, you can have exit games with the properties I describe in the tweet."
14758,2020-06-26 12:17:40+00:00,hasufl,"@gphummer @jadler0 @Mable_Jiang Even a rational attacker has to model the consequences of governance-gone-rogue on the expectation of future cash flows. My guess is, it does not look good for him."
14759,2020-06-26 12:15:15+00:00,hasufl,"@fnietom ‚ÄúUseless‚Äù as in, this chain has been out-of-service for the entirety of its existence. What do you think happens to the price in the meantime as all users on exchanges rush to the exit?"
14760,2020-06-26 12:12:19+00:00,hasufl,@Chloethedev @jadler0 @gross_bit @Mable_Jiang 48 hours is way too short in the long-term. 30 days is probably fine. The only reason it‚Äôs 48h today is that there‚Äôs still a large risk of smart contract bugs. So it‚Äôs a tradeoffs between ‚Äúinsecurity from hackers or insecurity from governance‚Äù
14761,2020-06-26 12:08:13+00:00,hasufl,EIP-1559 can make mass-exit games viable because it is the first secure oracle for on-chain congestion.
14762,2020-06-26 12:06:43+00:00,hasufl,"@dankrad @jadler0 @Mable_Jiang Agree that‚Äôs possible and would require off-chain governance to kick in. If @jadler0 was going for that, it‚Äôs not enough for me to say a governance token not-held-by-the-majority is worth zero."
14763,2020-06-26 12:04:11+00:00,hasufl,"@fnietom It‚Äôs simply impossible to make such a statement, since you assume the market finds a useless fork of Bitcoin valuable indefinitely."
14764,2020-06-26 12:02:54+00:00,hasufl,"@jadler0 @gross_bit @Mable_Jiang Btw, this is a great use case for congestion controlled mass-exit post EIP-1559! As long as chain congestion is provably &gt;x, the exit period extends itself indefinitely until everyone who‚Äôs willing to pay y has had the chance to get their money out."
14765,2020-06-26 12:01:10+00:00,hasufl,"@jadler0 @gross_bit @Mable_Jiang K, I was wondering if there‚Äôs anything else to think about than congestion. Compound has several hundred million dollars stored. Users would be willing to pay a lot in fees to pull out. Smaller balances (mb sub $100) would surely be lost."
14766,2020-06-26 11:59:26+00:00,hasufl,@jadler0 @Mable_Jiang It doesn‚Äôt have monetary value since it‚Äôs not used as money. It has value from future cash flows. You don‚Äôt need to be a majority token holder to benefit from that.
14767,2020-06-26 11:53:24+00:00,hasufl,@jadler0 @gross_bit @Mable_Jiang How does a mass exit play out in Compound?
14768,2020-06-26 11:49:44+00:00,hasufl,@fnietom There‚Äôs no reason to beat around the bush: any cryptocurrency with permissionless block producer set can be DOS-ed indefinitely. Just a matter if the incentives to do so exist.
14769,2020-06-26 11:47:23+00:00,hasufl,"@fnietom Considerations like these are moot if the attacker is willing to outspend defenders for a sustained period of time. The longer this takes, the more confidence and price will race towards zero. Then the defenders‚Äô willingness to spend falls together with that."
14770,2020-06-26 10:59:14+00:00,hasufl,@fnietom I don‚Äôt think manual invalidating is a viable strategy against an attacker who consecutively mines empty blocks.
14771,2020-06-26 02:29:37+00:00,hasufl,@gross_bit @Mable_Jiang there's a 48h delay to all governance changes where users can withdraw
14772,2020-06-26 01:11:30+00:00,hasufl,"@Mable_Jiang are you thinking of any specific project? In the case of Compound, they'll just take a fee from the interest paid from borrowers to lenders. No need for complex constructions. Think it's all but certain we see this in the future"
14773,2020-06-26 00:57:31+00:00,hasufl,@Mable_Jiang it's much simpler than that imo. All governance tokens can be used to charge rent from users in the future.
14774,2020-06-26 00:55:28+00:00,hasufl,"@ncchan93 @kevinsekniqi sure, that's always possible in a permissionless network"
14775,2020-06-26 00:48:53+00:00,hasufl,"@kevinsekniqi That's not to say hashpower distribution is not important. But it goes hand in hand with the incentive layer, and both can make up for each other's weaknesses to some degree."
14776,2020-06-26 00:47:39+00:00,hasufl,"@kevinsekniqi Fairness is a serious concern in PoW, but I think there's a reason we have never seen selfish mining in the wild: the coin price is endogenous to the way miners look at Bitcoin. In other words, large miners have large sunk costs in hardware and are afraid to hurt the token price."

14784,2020-06-25 15:28:33+00:00,hasufl,"@SomsenRuben @RainDogDance @zndtoshi @ercwl btw, not burning txn fees when the protocol says they should be burned is theft from holders. Similar to increasing the issuance rate. I'm certain there would be a violent reaction to that"
14785,2020-06-25 15:27:34+00:00,hasufl,"@SomsenRuben @RainDogDance @zndtoshi @ercwl censorship is such a wide field, so you can hardly argue it's not profitable. A $50 minimum fee on Bitcoin would be censorship for all sub-$50 transactions."

14789,2020-06-25 14:49:51+00:00,hasufl,"@SomsenRuben @RainDogDance @zndtoshi @ercwl that's why, on top of the operational difficulty to collude, miners must be bound by their hardware investment into ASICs that is strongly correlated to the value of the coin itself."
14790,2020-06-25 14:48:58+00:00,hasufl,"@SomsenRuben @RainDogDance @zndtoshi @ercwl yes, if they can blocks consistently below 10m gas then BASEFEE will trend towards zero. But the game theory behind that is the same as in Bitcoin. If all miners collude, they can do practically anything. For example, enforce a minimum fee in the protocol or blacklist users."

14795,2020-06-25 14:11:38+00:00,hasufl,@RainDogDance @zndtoshi @ercwl keep in mind Ethereum has literally had a manual change to lower issuance. I think you overestimate what fights are worth fighting for miners.

14798,2020-06-25 13:13:14+00:00,hasufl,"@zndtoshi @ercwl yes, that's what I think. At least bring it outside of the control of miners. We probably talk to different circles of people then"
14799,2020-06-25 13:08:33+00:00,hasufl,"@zndtoshi @ercwl that's part of what I meant. In the past, there wouldn't have been support for a change like this. It shows an increase in adversarial thinking. Miners are not your friends."
14800,2020-06-25 13:06:30+00:00,hasufl,"@zndtoshi @ercwl that is correct, in Ethereum miners decide the block size (though historically after discussion w/ devs and community). I'm strongly opposed to this, as are plenty of other ppl I know. I have a feeling it'll be changed in the future."
14801,2020-06-25 12:13:17+00:00,hasufl,"@zndtoshi @ercwl I think the Ethereum developers understand why these constraints on capacity are necessary today, more so than a few years ago. Design philosophies of Bitcoin and Ethereum have started to converge for some time now."
14802,2020-06-25 12:10:30+00:00,hasufl,"@zndtoshi @ercwl I don‚Äôt see a problem with that statement (w/o watching the video). You can have a long-term goal of a high capacity system. In practice, it‚Äôs nothing more than a long-term goal. In the short-term, capacity must be constrained and fees are the result of demand for blockspace."
14803,2020-06-25 11:35:38+00:00,hasufl,"@zndtoshi @ercwl I should add, * when you can externalize costs. That‚Äôs one reason we need to constrain the blocksize. If fees are zero, blocks will always be filled with garbage, driving up costs to all validators."
14804,2020-06-25 11:34:05+00:00,hasufl,"@zndtoshi @ercwl Not sure how familiar you are with the idea of gas tokens that the original poster talks about, but those also don‚Äôt (and can‚Äôt) exist in Bitcoin. So there is no way to monetize blockspace later that you bought today."
14805,2020-06-25 11:27:13+00:00,hasufl,"@globedx @ameensol Ameen says Bitcoin can‚Äôt be changed because the Bitcoin community thinks it can‚Äôt be changed. That‚Äôs the idea of a Schelling fence. It‚Äôs not the result of size, but how people think about the respective project. Another project in Bitcoin‚Äôs position would have a diff community."
14806,2020-06-25 11:25:36+00:00,hasufl,"@zndtoshi @ercwl To quote gmaxwell, there is near infinite demand for highly replicated storage. Where is the connection to L2 in the question?"

14921,2020-06-13 23:07:13+00:00,hasufl,"Likewise, if private sector demand to borrow is low (e.g. due to economic uncertainty), very few bank deposits are created. 

Increasing the number of reserves affects neither (1) nor (2). We can confirm that by looking at countries like Canada that have no reserve requirements."
14922,2020-06-13 23:07:12+00:00,hasufl,"When banks lend too much money to un-creditworthy customers, their liabilities and assets go out of whack and the bank runs the risk of going broke. This shows that their ability to create loans is primarily constrained by the capital part of the balance sheet."
14923,2020-06-13 23:07:12+00:00,hasufl,"For every loan a bank makes, they create a deposit on the liability side which is backed by a financial asset on the asset side of their balance sheet. The financial asset can be the customer's future ability to repay or a more tangible form of collateral, like a house."
14924,2020-06-13 23:07:12+00:00,hasufl,"Pushing more reserves on banks does not get them to lend more. Instead, banks can already get all the reserves they need from the overnight market (where banks lend to themselves overnight) or from the Fed itself."
14925,2020-06-13 23:07:12+00:00,hasufl,"It is correct that banks create money (actually, they create deposits, which is the dominant form of money today) by debt monetization. But the amount of money creation is never constrained by reserves and always by having (1) enough capital and (2) enough private sector demand."
14926,2020-06-13 23:07:11+00:00,hasufl,"The folk view is banks can take these reserves and lend them to the private sector (up to the reserve limit), thereby ""multiplying"" the money via credit creation. This view is incoherent with how banks actually create money."

The Fed is effectively a bank for banks. It replaced private clearinghouses after the Federal Reserve Act of 1913."

14930,2020-06-13 22:03:21+00:00,hasufl,@bitstein It was a genuine question. Don't Bitcoin's boom and bust cycles indicate that investors are prone to herd behavior and bouts of mania+depression even in the absence of credit expansion?

15134,2020-06-05 16:06:19+00:00,hasufl,@MichaelDunwort1 Exactly! I'm arguing that blockchains are not magically different from that.

15136,2020-06-05 15:53:42+00:00,hasufl,@MichaelDunwort1 It seems to me that just passively holding Bitcoin and not pushing for any changes (or forking) is the most economically rational course for most people?
15137,2020-06-05 15:47:52+00:00,hasufl,"@MichaelDunwort1 My point is the rules and the economic motivations of actors are tightly intertwined. When users see an economic benefit to changing the rules, they will do so."

15139,2020-06-05 15:40:21+00:00,hasufl,@RainDogDance Let me rephrase. There was a large special interest group against bigger blocks as well as an intolerant majority.
15140,2020-06-05 15:38:19+00:00,hasufl,"@RainDogDance I don‚Äôt think there was a significant smaller-block fraction back then.

15141,2020-06-05 15:35:35+00:00,hasufl,"@RainDogDance @JeremyRubin You can review a change for years, but if the (significant) cost of adopting it outweighs the benefit it still won‚Äôt be adopted. The only way is to ride on an even more beneficial proposal, or bundle together with many less significant ones."
15142,2020-06-05 15:32:51+00:00,hasufl,@MichaelDunwort1 I agree with that view. Users are not == users. What matters is their economic relevance to the system.
15143,2020-06-05 15:19:40+00:00,hasufl,"@RainDogDance On a high level:
* all changes must be pushed by special interest groups
* intolerance of the majority exists on a gradient - the more intolerant, the harder changes are *in general*
* hence, there is a vast space of changes that are positive, but not positive enough."
15144,2020-06-05 15:16:11+00:00,hasufl,"@RainDogDance yup, I clarified that. I think there are significant informal barriers to changing Bitcoin that discourage the steps you describe in the first place (getting to that formal implementation stage)"
15145,2020-06-05 15:12:28+00:00,hasufl,@MichaelDunwort1 I'm thinking about users of a particular system. Anyone who interfaces with it in any way. Most people don't participate in governance unless the stakes are really high
15146,2020-06-05 13:26:09+00:00,hasufl,@muellerberndt the reason is all the cost incurred on the majority by these changes. The more people used custodians the lower these costs on the majority would be.
15147,2020-06-05 13:25:13+00:00,hasufl,"@muellerberndt Yes, intolerance of the majority exists on a gradient. The more intolerant it is, the larger special interest groups need to be.

15288,2020-05-27 00:59:03+00:00,hasufl,@gladstein it definitely helps when users can connect directly to the network rather than through someone else.

15941,2020-05-12 16:54:45+00:00,hasufl,"@evoskuil @RussHarben @SGBarbour Difficulty adjustment is a huge profit incentive for a monopoly. If you can make a credible threat to reorg all competing blocks, you can lower your CoC to zero without decreasing your profit much (other ofc than market disliking what you do)"
15942,2020-05-12 16:52:56+00:00,hasufl,"@evoskuil @RussHarben @SGBarbour Huh, I never assume that anywhere. In fact, I'm saying the monopoly has a de facto 100% profit margin no matter what they do because they have zero cost. But they can still make more or less revenue based on their decisions what txns they mine."
15943,2020-05-12 16:49:01+00:00,hasufl,Would be fun if someone took over Bitcoin and made a credible-enough threat to reorg all outside blocks that he can mine on a toaster
15944,2020-05-12 16:46:12+00:00,hasufl,"@evoskuil @RussHarben @SGBarbour (because difficulty adjusts downward)
of course, that could attract people to break the monopoly, but we'll ignore that here. the bottom line is, he can fully control his cost. it merely needs to be high enough to assert dominance."
15945,2020-05-12 16:45:11+00:00,hasufl,@evoskuil @RussHarben @SGBarbour I don't follow. A monopoly miner has effectively zero cost after his dominance is established. He could mine on a toaster if he wanted to.
15946,2020-05-12 16:43:05+00:00,hasufl,"@evoskuil @RussHarben @SGBarbour We can say with certainty that if revenue drops, the miner loses money. Not in cashflow, since he already fully controls difficulty. He can spend as much or little on mining as he wants. But in opportunity cost (costs would be the same, but revenue higher, without censorship)"
15947,2020-05-12 16:39:41+00:00,hasufl,"@evoskuil @RussHarben @SGBarbour Yeah, it comes down to us having different assumptions about how the market would react to censorship. I fully caveat my stance by saying it depends on the market punishing censorship by selling&amp;leaving

15948,2020-05-12 16:37:56+00:00,hasufl,"@specialenmity @evoskuil @RussHarben @SGBarbour Yeah, esp. since we clarified we both assume a monopoly miner who gets 100% of the in-protocol rewards."
15949,2020-05-12 16:35:00+00:00,hasufl,"@evoskuil @RussHarben @SGBarbour Exploring these tangents, it doesn't seem like we disagree about much at all.

I think their revenue from censorship (inside the protocol only) would go down because the benefit from monopoly pricing can't make up for ppl leaving and coin price dropping."
15950,2020-05-12 16:27:47+00:00,hasufl,"@evoskuil @RussHarben @SGBarbour They might make a lot more from fees in BTC, but the $ value of these coins would be much, much lower."
15951,2020-05-12 16:27:10+00:00,hasufl,"@evoskuil @RussHarben @SGBarbour These thought experiments typically break down once we stop seeing Bitcoin as a closed system. When miners stop processing any txn &lt;$100 and could enforce that forever, it's not clear at all that their revenue would go up. People can just leave and use something else."
15952,2020-05-12 16:26:04+00:00,hasufl,"@evoskuil @RussHarben @SGBarbour Ah, I wasn't aware you're talking about the miner charging monopoly prices. 

Are you thinking for everyone or only a small number of people? The way I see it, the more people are affected, the lower bitcoin's price will go."
15953,2020-05-12 16:21:17+00:00,hasufl,"@evoskuil @RussHarben @SGBarbour I'm already assuming a single monopoly miner for sake of simplicity. Where is the tragedy of the commons here?

Please ignore revenue made outside the system. Our initial question was if a censoring miner makes less money from mining Bitcoin than an honest one."
15954,2020-05-12 16:18:00+00:00,hasufl,@evoskuil @RussHarben @SGBarbour The fact that they can subsidize the loss with revenue generated outside the system (a Goldfinger attack) does not change that equation. Sufficiently large external incentive breaks every permissioned system.
15955,2020-05-12 16:16:48+00:00,hasufl,"@evoskuil @RussHarben @SGBarbour You did not show it, btw. We can evaluate their future revenue from mining BTC. 

In my example,
EV(honest mining) = $100m
EV(censorship) = $80m

they lose $20m, even if you assume the state to be the *only* miner"

17219,2020-02-07 01:29:26+00:00,hasufl,@joonian @pete_rizzo_ @0xstark It's a failed mechanism because security comes exclusively from congestion (tx fees). But demand to transact is not representative of the demand to hold BTC.
17220,2020-02-07 01:27:36+00:00,hasufl,"@joonian @pete_rizzo_ @0xstark I'd strongly push back because Bitcoin, in that scenario, wouldn't die from a lack of demand.

17223,2020-02-07 01:19:26+00:00,hasufl,"@pete_rizzo_ @0xstark As a result, you can't get into a position where miners can no longer afford to mine. That's not the problem here. The problem is that future rewards could go so low that an attacker no longer incurs a large opportunity cost by attacking Bitcoin."
17224,2020-02-07 01:16:35+00:00,hasufl,"@pete_rizzo_ @0xstark You're looking at it backward. The mining reward doesn't have to pay the cost of mining ops.

17227,2020-02-07 01:03:20+00:00,hasufl,@pete_rizzo_ @0xstark It's a problem because an attacker has to burn less and less money *relative* to Bitcoin's network value.
17228,2020-02-07 01:02:17+00:00,hasufl,"@pete_rizzo_ @0xstark All values in $ here. If the $ price of $BTC increases, the $ network value increases, and the $ security budget increases."
17229,2020-02-07 01:01:13+00:00,hasufl,"@pete_rizzo_ @0xstark This is a massively important property of Bitcoin and one of the reasons it has stayed secure over 11 years. Problems emerge if the security budget, in BTC, falls below a critical threshold (full disclaimer: we don't know where that threshold is.)"
17230,2020-02-07 00:59:49+00:00,hasufl,"@pete_rizzo_ @0xstark Our point is, it doesn't matter for security if the market moves up, down, or sideways. The security budget, consisting of future block rewards, scales with the network value.

Example: $BTC doubles, network value doubles, security budget doubles"
17231,2020-02-07 00:56:09+00:00,hasufl,@pete_rizzo_ @0xstark I don't assume anything about that. Sounds like a completely tangential issue.

17233,2020-02-07 00:47:42+00:00,hasufl,@pete_rizzo_ @0xstark So basically it's instrumental to Bitcoin's long-term robustness that the miner incentive is sufficiently large. Experts disagree just how large.

19422,2019-10-18 13:20:12+00:00,hasufl,@SavantSpecter @RyanSAdams @PeterRizun You address an interesting problem. The system designers have to make a conscious decision which users the system should serve and which it shouldn't serve. A system that tries to serve everyone ends up serving no one.

19425,2019-10-18 13:05:36+00:00,hasufl,"@PeterRizun @RyanSAdams Exactly! The goal of monetary policy is the same as of the system as a whole: maximizing value for its users. ""Security"" is how well it can deliver that value under adversarial conditions."

19427,2019-10-18 12:26:57+00:00,hasufl,"@RyanSAdams It depends on how you define security. If we see security as the maximum MEV (and hence economic activity) a system can tolerate relative to its network value, then security increases linearly with MR."

19582,2019-10-11 15:34:35+00:00,hasufl,@Leorzhang @csuwildcat Why does more hashrate push fees down?
19583,2019-10-11 15:33:29+00:00,hasufl,"@joekelly100 @mikekelly85 @nic__carter No, because the network at current parameters can tolerate more than $125m MEV even if users wait for 6 confirmations or less. 

It can tolerate that level of MEV because their two-year commitment forces miners to maximize the average BTC coin price over two years."
19584,2019-10-11 15:29:07+00:00,hasufl,"@arlynculwick Weird that you come to the opposite conclusion. I absolutely agree that miners have to factor in price volatility. To me, that means less commitment at the same revenue, resulting in less security."
19585,2019-10-11 15:27:21+00:00,hasufl,"@csuwildcat @Leorzhang Absolutely. If someone spent $50b on destroying Bitcoin today, he could do a ton of damage. 

Ultimately Bitcoin relies on defenders being willing and capable of outspending an attacker. 

The Bitcoin protocol basically solves the coordination and financing of that defense."

19587,2019-10-11 15:05:15+00:00,hasufl,@Leorzhang @csuwildcat Can we assume that hashrate will be growing if a censorship attack renders the network unusable? I think we may be talking about two different attacks here.
19588,2019-10-11 15:02:34+00:00,hasufl,"@Leorzhang @csuwildcat Is that what you meant? The fees must indeed be in the billions. I just checked my model, and for miners to afford a 50% price drop from a 1000-block censorship attack, the attacker must pay them at least 400k BTC in fees."
19589,2019-10-11 14:59:49+00:00,hasufl,"@Leorzhang @csuwildcat I'm not sure any of that really matters in this attack. The crux is that miners who accept censorship-transactions don't maximize the value of Bitcoin, so the fees in these transactions would have to be absurdly high for them to be worth it."
19590,2019-10-11 14:57:46+00:00,hasufl,"@joekelly100 @StevieJarosz @_prestwich @bcmakes Then the bribe is part of MEV, and they are still committed to the value of BTC. MEV has to exceed the damage to that commitment."
19591,2019-10-11 14:50:44+00:00,hasufl,@Leorzhang @csuwildcat Why billions? The cost of the attack is how much you pay in fees; the transactions themselves don't have to contain any value.
19592,2019-10-11 14:48:47+00:00,hasufl,"@matt_odell @csuwildcat Not necessarily. It depends on whether the attacker can subsidize the costs by making other income streams of his more valuable (seigniorage from fiat, taxation, capital controls...)"
19593,2019-10-11 14:47:06+00:00,hasufl,"@Leorzhang @csuwildcat Same as in the regular censorship attack. Sabotage Bitcoin to make your external income streams more valuable (e.g., seigniorage from the fiat system, or revenue from effective taxation)"
19594,2019-10-11 14:45:42+00:00,hasufl,"@csuwildcat @Leorzhang Whether an identity layer qualifies as price-positive for BTC, I don't know. What do you think?"
19595,2019-10-11 14:45:13+00:00,hasufl,"@csuwildcat @Leorzhang Yeah, that makes sense. If you can identify to miners as a business that positively affects the price of BTC, they should prioritize your transaction even at lower fees because ignoring it might not be worth the risk of lowering Bitcoin's value."
19596,2019-10-11 14:41:34+00:00,hasufl,"@joekelly100 @_prestwich @bcmakes I think there's a fallacy in there. BTC hardware becomes less useful as it depreciates. If that's not the case, and depreciated hardware can still mine somewhat competitively, your assumed depreciation schedule has been wrong in the first place."
19597,2019-10-11 14:33:03+00:00,hasufl,"@csuwildcat @Leorzhang In general, users should really start seeing miners as their allies against outside attackers. Due to the miner commitment, they sit in the same boat. Maybe together we can come up with ideas on how such attacks can be stopped."
19598,2019-10-11 14:29:55+00:00,hasufl,@csuwildcat Good question. Definitely a tricky proposition for miners! Maybe @Leorzhang has an idea of how he would handle this attack as a miner?
19599,2019-10-11 14:27:44+00:00,hasufl,"@csuwildcat Basically, the attacker would have to pay miners so much that MEV is &gt; the loss to their commitment. When an attacker directly pays miners, we can just treat him as part of the attack coalition, at which point the attack should be the same as the regular censorship attack."
19600,2019-10-11 14:26:11+00:00,hasufl,"@csuwildcat It's certainly an interesting idea that hasn't come up in the literature on possible attacks. You would figure that miners have a large incentive to simply ignore these ""censorship transactions"" if the price of BTC would otherwise fall."

The latter becomes only relevant when miner revenue is so low that the system can't afford a lot of user activity anymore. It's a backstop for security."

19721,2019-09-27 13:52:05+00:00,hasufl,"Overall, these are great podcasts for one because Laura is a great host that checks her ego at the door and doesn't pretend she gets something when she doesn't. And second, her show has enough of a moat that she can ask uncomfortable questions and still get high-profile guests."
19722,2019-09-27 13:44:26+00:00,hasufl,"There are other reasons, e.g. that most other podcasts are too long and force you to skip the first 30 minutes of ever-repeating ""what's your background"" questions instead of giving a 60-sec summary and then jumping right into the action."
19723,2019-09-27 13:41:49+00:00,hasufl,"This frustrates me because when the host didn't get it there's a good chance I, the listener, didn't get it either. But whether to not look bad, or not make the guest look bad, hosts typically don't follow up and push for better explanations until it clicks. This happens _a ton_."
19724,2019-09-27 13:41:49+00:00,hasufl,"The second reason is that @laurashin keeps asking until she understood. I can't remember how many times I was annoyed with other shows where a guest gives an insufficient explanation of a concept or thing that happened, and it's 100% obvious the host didn't get it."
19725,2019-09-27 13:41:48+00:00,hasufl,"Hence, any podcast without a significant moat in reach either gets mediocre guests and good interviews or good guests and mediocre interviews. Good guests and good interviews require that the value of the podcast to the guest is high even when questions are hard."
19726,2019-09-27 13:41:48+00:00,hasufl,"When too much leverage resides with the guests, interviews will be worse because guests can select easy conversations over hard ones. Who wants to face hard questions on-air when there are ten other podcasts with the same audience?"
19727,2019-09-27 13:41:48+00:00,hasufl,"That a host should see eye-to-eye with the guest seems obvious, so why don't other crypto podcasts do this as much? I think the answer lies in the relatively high supply of podcasts, and relatively low supply of interesting guests."
19728,2019-09-27 13:41:47+00:00,hasufl,"First, she asks uncomfortable questions. It's hard to do this delicately, and sometimes you get a crazy show like EP78 with Dominic Williams of Dfinity who practically collapsed from her (modest!) pushback.

Most people see majority changes as forks and minority changes as altcoins. So Protestantism would be an altcoin. The Pope reinterpreting a bible verse would be a fork. But we are leaving the original debate here.

20213,2019-09-07 11:14:49+00:00,hasufl,"@MaciekLaskus @udiWertheimer No, Protestantism is a clean hard-fork from Catholicism. I was speaking from the perspective of the individual user."
20214,2019-09-07 11:05:06+00:00,hasufl,"@MaciekLaskus @udiWertheimer The utility of Bitcoin depends even more on other users than religions. In religion, you can follow some of the rules and ignore others. If someone locally breaks a rule in Bitcoin, they are out. That makes disagreements in Bitcoin more dangerous, but also less common."

20216,2019-09-07 10:53:55+00:00,hasufl,@udiWertheimer I have to trust that I know someone's utility function. I have to trust that they know it themselves. I then have to trust they actually do what's in their best interest. Humans are irrational.

Bitcoin: You have to trust very little under normal operations. In case of failure, everyone in the network needs to agree how to fix it."
20219,2019-09-07 10:31:31+00:00,hasufl,"There's a widespread denial about Bitcoin's trust model, even though the above view is supported by factual Bitcoin history. There is no reason to be ashamed, either: While Bitcoin is still a trusted system, it requires LESS TRUST LESS OFTEN than alternative systems."
20220,2019-09-07 10:31:30+00:00,hasufl,"The periods of social consensus are so pivotal that we care a lot about where others stand, and invest a lot of energy so people who stood against us before (e.g. NYAG supporters) lose their voice in future social consensus."
20221,2019-09-07 10:29:11+00:00,hasufl,"Bitcoin is not a system that requires NO TRUST between participants, nor would that be desirable. So far, humans had to to intervene every two years, either to fix a dangerous bug, undo damages from a bug, or push back against an internal takeover."
20222,2019-09-07 10:29:11+00:00,hasufl,Real talk: We are vigilant about the values of other bitcoiners because we have to TRUST they will stand with us when shit hits the fan and some dangerous force is threatening to destroy Bitcoin's social contract.

20289,2019-09-04 14:47:13+00:00,hasufl,@fnietom @phildaian Do you remember where you got this definition? That seems way too broad to ever be proven since you can't know the profit opportunities of an attacker (e.g. of a nation-state to defend their monetary sovereignty and ability to tax)
20290,2019-09-04 14:42:42+00:00,hasufl,@phildaian @jadler0 @fnietom What would you two suggest to replace it with?

Why?"
20292,2019-09-04 14:36:46+00:00,hasufl,"@fnietom @phildaian When Bitcoin defenders collectively spend more money than potential Bitcoin attackers could muster for an attack, we have proven Bitcoin's incentive compatibility in our model. We can't prove however that the model is not going to change in the future."
20293,2019-09-04 14:32:01+00:00,hasufl,"@phildaian @fnietom Incentive compatibility, at the end of the day, can only be defined in the context of the amount of money that both the attacker and the defenders are willing to spend."
20294,2019-09-04 14:29:59+00:00,hasufl,@phildaian @fnietom 100% agree.
20295,2019-09-04 14:29:18+00:00,hasufl,"@phildaian @fnietom If you disagree with that @fnietom, can you explain why the UASF worked if it never threatened a chain split?"
20296,2019-09-04 14:27:29+00:00,hasufl,"@ManuelPolavieja @fnietom I want to understand, is your argument that paper-based futures markets can be used to indefinitely suppress the spot price of any asset?"
20297,2019-09-04 14:26:17+00:00,hasufl,"@phildaian @fnietom I think excess hashrate strengthens incentive compatibility but is not a prerequisite. We should always assume 100% of the hashrate is rational, not honest."
20298,2019-09-04 14:24:02+00:00,hasufl,"@phildaian @fnietom Agree. Specifically, a UASF as we've seen it is the threat of a hard-fork (basically users saying ""we accept a lower coin value but with our rules"" to which the miners say ""okok, you called our bluff. We do care more about coin value than rules after all"")"
20299,2019-09-04 14:20:29+00:00,hasufl,@fnietom @phildaian Your proposed attack on PoS may not be *profitable* either when the defenders can fork away.

20302,2019-09-04 14:07:37+00:00,hasufl,@fnietom @ManuelPolavieja Because we seem to be in agreement that both in PoW and PoS any attacker with deep enough pockets can control the system. I want to understand exactly where you think the space of possible responses to that in PoW and PoS differs.

(100% chosen for sake of simplicity. We know that 40% won't keep mining for long if the attacker refuses to build on their blocks)"
20305,2019-09-04 14:00:13+00:00,hasufl,@fnietom @ManuelPolavieja I don't see why relying on the market is a bad thing here? The market can stay solvent a lot longer than most attackers can.
20306,2019-09-04 13:52:31+00:00,hasufl,@ManuelPolavieja @fnietom You don't think the price of the token would skyrocket while you buy up half the supply?
20307,2019-09-04 13:51:42+00:00,hasufl,"@RyanSAdams @TrustlessState I'm sure creative attackers can benefit from messing with non-bearer assets, esp. once these assets are integrated into ""decentralized"" infrastructure like Compound/Maker/etc. The attacker only needs to profit in the bearer asset, it doesn't have to be the target of attack."
20308,2019-09-04 13:47:31+00:00,hasufl,"@TrustlessState @RyanSAdams I agree that they contribute to security, just not as much as they contribute to the incentive to attack.

20309,2019-09-04 13:36:47+00:00,hasufl,@fnietom @ManuelPolavieja Why is UASF impossible in PoS?
20310,2019-09-04 13:34:48+00:00,hasufl,@ManuelPolavieja @fnietom I think you forget that any energy you burn in PoW is paid for with fees and block rewards.
20311,2019-09-04 13:33:40+00:00,hasufl,@TrustlessState @RyanSAdams They can also make the native asset less useful (the price of the native asset is the backbone of blockchain security) by making it more expensive to use than necessary.
20312,2019-09-04 13:30:20+00:00,hasufl,@TrustlessState @RyanSAdams Miners/stakers can attack the network to mess with non-native tokens without also having forced exposure to these non-native tokens (via stake or via hardware). That's a BFD.
20313,2019-09-04 13:27:57+00:00,hasufl,@TrustlessState @RyanSAdams Non-native tokens free-ride on the network security provided by the native token. They increase the incentive to attack the network without also contributing to its security.
20314,2019-09-04 13:26:33+00:00,hasufl,@ManuelPolavieja @fnietom Any attack is a financial attack.
20315,2019-09-04 13:25:03+00:00,hasufl,"@fnietom @ManuelPolavieja Can you explain why a hashrate majority can't ""destroy consensus for profit"" in PoW? Assuming we agree that if building a massive short position works for one asset, then it works for the other as well."
20316,2019-09-04 13:23:06+00:00,hasufl,"@ManuelPolavieja @fnietom 1. It doesn't matter what you buy tokens/hardware/energy with. Their price is the result of supply/demand.

2. There's global arbitrage for tokens (no one can buy tokens at 10% of the global average price). With energy, that happens all the time. That's a point for tokens."
20317,2019-09-04 13:16:51+00:00,hasufl,@ManuelPolavieja @fnietom How are tokens less constrained than electricity?
20318,2019-09-04 13:03:22+00:00,hasufl,@RyanSAdams No disagreement about that. You know I strongly support the layered scaling approach
20319,2019-09-04 13:01:18+00:00,hasufl,@TrustlessState @RyanSAdams Hosting non-protocol-native assets threatens incentive compatibility.
20320,2019-09-04 12:55:27+00:00,hasufl,"@RyanSAdams I would, however, strongly push back on the idea that being the transport layer for a completely centralized token is an indicator of that success. If anything, pricing out such use cases would be the more positive sign."
20321,2019-09-04 12:54:41+00:00,hasufl,@RyanSAdams Point granted! I don't count myself towards that group (bought $ETH shortly before even buying $BTC).
20322,2019-09-04 12:47:48+00:00,hasufl,@RyanSAdams Still doesn't explain why USDT on Ethereum would have been unthinkable. Tether didn't even exist before 2017 (had a mere $5m mcap going into the year)

20324,2019-09-04 12:27:08+00:00,hasufl,@RyanSAdams Why was that unthinkable? Using the Bitcoin base layer never made sense for a centralized asset. Same will happen to Ethereum eventually (or at least you should hope so)
20325,2019-09-04 10:59:47+00:00,hasufl,@fnietom Any system can be attacked by irrational (loosely defined as not EV maximizing) actors with deep pockets. Your arguments don't convince me that it can be attacked by rational actors. You suggest it is profitable to completely corner a market just to crash it. That's madness!

20329,2019-09-04 10:40:14+00:00,hasufl,@fnietom Do you think you buy 51% of a big PoS network's stake *and* hedge it without ever disclosing your identity? Seems highly unlikely to me.
20330,2019-09-04 10:32:09+00:00,hasufl,"@fnietom Same can be said about OI for single stocks, surely it has happened before in history if the attack is indeed possible?"
20331,2019-09-04 10:30:14+00:00,hasufl,"@fnietom What do you mean by ""the original coin becomes worthless so that doesn't affect the attacker""? Dropping the coin value in ""his"" reality to zero is the goal of the fork"
20332,2019-09-04 10:28:09+00:00,hasufl,"@fnietom Last, I reject the premise that owning over half the stake in a network can be hedged. That's the equivalent of hedging over half the voting stock in a publicly traded business - why should the market allow that?"
20333,2019-09-04 10:25:54+00:00,hasufl,"@fnietom Having that option to severely punish misbehavior (in both PoS and PoW) helps incentive compatibility in a major way, even when it's never used."
20334,2019-09-04 10:23:14+00:00,hasufl,"@fnietom While I agree that censorship is worse in PoS, the users can still collectively fork the network without the censor. Arguably it's even easier to selectively punish the censor without hurting honest validators as collateral."

20339,2019-09-04 09:38:05+00:00,hasufl,"@fnietom Not convincing. First, controlling 51% of the supply is extremely hard, arguably harder than acquiring 51% of all hashrate.

and no confidence crises possible, because we don't trust each other at all in the first place. We only transact with full collateral and settle immediately."
20393,2019-08-31 13:01:25+00:00,hasufl,"@CoveringDelta @RainDogDance @RyanMilb @RaoulGMI If I now want to send you 100, that won't work - my side of the channel only has 50 sats of collateral left.

As you see, there's never any credit/CP risk/undercollateralization. 

We both can broadcast the presigned tx and redeem each other's collateral at any time."
20394,2019-08-31 12:59:02+00:00,hasufl,"@CoveringDelta @RainDogDance @RyanMilb @RaoulGMI Maybe an example helps the best. Imagine we open a channel with 100 sat each. So the channel is 100/100. We both get a presigned tx to redeem at 100/100. 

Now I send you 50 and we update the channel balance to 50/150. Presigned tx are also updated."
20395,2019-08-31 12:55:31+00:00,hasufl,"@CoveringDelta @RyanMilb @RainDogDance @RaoulGMI To reiterate, if your CP in a channel gets hacked he cannot steal your money. He can only force liquidation of the channel (take the collateralized contract and redeem it onchain) and then you both get what you own, you only lose the channel."
20396,2019-08-31 12:50:39+00:00,hasufl,"@CoveringDelta @RainDogDance @RyanMilb @RaoulGMI As long as both sides of a channel are happy with the arrangement and the channel is sufficiently collateralized, they can keep transacting contracts instead of onchain bitcoin. What makes this trustless is the ability for either party to unilaterally cash out to the main chain."
20397,2019-08-31 12:45:11+00:00,hasufl,"@CoveringDelta @RainDogDance @RyanMilb @RaoulGMI They are though. You can broadcast a valid presigned transactions to turn it into onchain bitcoin immediately. All that can stop you at this point is miner censorship, and that is true for an onchain transaction as well."
20398,2019-08-31 12:43:12+00:00,hasufl,@CoveringDelta @RainDogDance @RyanMilb @RaoulGMI If you understand this architecture you will see that trust is absolutely not the issue - it is all the collateral required to make this work.
20399,2019-08-31 12:41:08+00:00,hasufl,"@CoveringDelta @RainDogDance @RyanMilb @RaoulGMI It's super important to understand that
1. Every transaction is fully collateralized, thus there's zero credit/cp risk
2. Every transaction is settled immediately by exchanging these collateralized contracts - it saves the cost of exchanging the collateral itself"
20400,2019-08-31 12:38:48+00:00,hasufl,@CoveringDelta @RainDogDance @RyanMilb @RaoulGMI What makes this more scalable is that it's very cheap to exchange these contracts back and forth *as long as all parties in that contract are sufficiently collateralized*.
20401,2019-08-31 12:36:54+00:00,hasufl,"@CoveringDelta @RainDogDance @RyanMilb @RaoulGMI There is no credit in LN, all transactions are settled immediately between parties - though, and that's the crucial part, not on the base chain but by exchanging trustless contracts (the presigned tx) that either party can take and redeem at the base chain at any time."
20402,2019-08-31 12:23:02+00:00,hasufl,"@CoveringDelta @RainDogDance @RaoulGMI It scales worse than trust-based systems where an intermediary (or federation of intermediaries) manages the ledger, which is ok. We can have many different Bitcoin payment systems with different trust/scalability tradeoffs. LN is very faithful to the on-chain trust model."
20403,2019-08-31 11:45:37+00:00,hasufl,@RainDogDance @CoveringDelta @RaoulGMI And the presigned transaction always reflects the current state of the channel (who owns how much)
20404,2019-08-31 11:44:57+00:00,hasufl,"@RainDogDance @CoveringDelta @RaoulGMI The key insight @CoveringDelta is that a valid presigned transaction is 99.9% as good as an on-chain transaction, because either party can unilaterally take the presigned transaction and turn it into an onchain transaction."
20405,2019-08-31 11:31:35+00:00,hasufl,@CoveringDelta @RainDogDance @RaoulGMI They are secure because the two parties exchange presigned transactions. Either of them can unilaterally close the channel and finalize the current state.

You can try to stiff customers with fake outcomes, but then word gets around and customers simply leave. The incentives are properly aligned towards honesty since outcomes are easily verifiable."
20884,2019-07-11 23:24:12+00:00,hasufl,@BrettRichey Why? You can have centralized companies like Binance or BitMEX. Put them on top of decentralized payment rails so you're not easily shut out from the financial system.

When the majority of validators is reachable, it can prevent unreachable validators from joining the network. That works in PoW, but it's even easier in a consortium. Thus, the network can never decentralize."
21211,2019-06-15 15:18:45+00:00,hasufl,"Libra/Globalcoin turns this concept on its head and then takes it to the extreme. With a consortium of global companies, validators are not just known, but hyper-reachable. Globally operating companies, naturally, can be pressured globally."
21212,2019-06-15 15:18:44+00:00,hasufl,"Thus, we can think of validators as either unknown and unreachable, known and unreachable or known and reachable. In Bitcoin, some validators are known and some unknown. That's fine because the unknown validators keep the network working even as known validators are shut down."
21213,2019-06-15 15:18:44+00:00,hasufl,"If you are known, you can still be unreachable by operating from a regulation haven and offer your services world-wide.

21214,2019-06-15 15:18:44+00:00,hasufl,At the foundation of cryptocurrency is the ability to validate transactions anonymously. Why does this matter? Known validators can be pressured to comply with local regulation and censor all users and transactions that don't don't comply.

21298,2019-06-07 03:23:37+00:00,hasufl,That Polo allowed someone to build such a massive position using this scheme and then not even prevented him from withdrawing is hard to forgive. All that regulation is worth nothing if you don't have basic risk management on your exchange.

21834,2019-04-30 17:09:32+00:00,hasufl,@lawmaster It's not fine at all. It's all about breaking expectations. Users of banks don't expect them to hold 100% reserves when they deposit and are compensated for that with interest. Tether holders expected 100% reserve and are not compensated for risks beyond that.

22060,2019-04-20 17:14:37+00:00,hasufl,"@panekkkk @cyounessi1 @zhusu @Rewkang If dai becomes more attractive, that is good for borrowers. But the effect is much smaller for borrowers than dai holders."
22061,2019-04-20 16:59:56+00:00,hasufl,"@panekkkk @cyounessi1 @zhusu @Rewkang Increased demand can cause the price of dai to rise, which is bad for borrowers.

Demand primarily matters for keeping the price of dai at around $1 and create basic network effects and liquidity for easy selling (and rebuying.)"
22062,2019-04-20 16:50:08+00:00,hasufl,@cyounessi1 @zhusu @Rewkang So no matter how good you make dai - for the borrower it will not make CDPs more attractive beyond a certain point.
22063,2019-04-20 16:48:50+00:00,hasufl,@cyounessi1 @zhusu @Rewkang Our point is that the borrowers of dai and the holders of dai are two different groups of people. To CDP owners the decentralized properties of dai matter little - they want enough liquidity to easily sell dai after borrowing - that is all.
22064,2019-04-20 16:13:45+00:00,hasufl,"@tommyburd @APompliano @MartyBent Ah, I get it now"

22068,2019-04-20 13:27:21+00:00,hasufl,"@panekkkk Yes, it's about scaling. Bitcoin is scaling beyond its on-chain capabilities today, with bitcoin banks. I've sent and received bitcoin with Coinbase and Xapo many times without ever touching the base layer."
22069,2019-04-20 13:25:51+00:00,hasufl,"@panekkkk @BobMcElrath Gun Sirer also supports BCH, who are currently debating to integrate Avalanche on their base layer (see recent Epicenter podcasts with Aumery Sechet). That's why we were talking about L1 scaling - it's not as well-established as you think."
22070,2019-04-20 13:22:55+00:00,hasufl,"@panekkkk @BobMcElrath Yes, Bob's quote is about L1. It's a response to Gun Sirer, who is also talking about L1 because he is working on a new L1 consensus protocol called Avalanche."
22071,2019-04-20 13:19:58+00:00,hasufl,"@panekkkk Nic is saying the present reality is bitcoin banks are already here. They are not going away because users like them - yes, even when L2 becomes a big success. But we have the chance, and responsibility, to shape these banks to our demands (for example w/ proof-of-solvency)"
22072,2019-04-20 13:12:26+00:00,hasufl,"@panekkkk @BobMcElrath You made this debate about L2, none of the people you quoted in your OP were talking about that."
22073,2019-04-20 13:10:40+00:00,hasufl,"@panekkkk I think the LN will be massively successful, no idea what capitulation you are talking about"
22074,2019-04-20 13:09:24+00:00,hasufl,"@panekkkk Cheaper transaction capacity can be plugged into that in the form of higher layers with worse security guarantees, like a network of payment channels or bitcoin banks. These proposals go back to Hal Finney."
22075,2019-04-20 13:06:38+00:00,hasufl,"@panekkkk Many bitcoiners have known this for a long time, hence the scaling debate ended the way it did. Bitcoin has embraced the fact that blockchains are hard to scale and focusses on producing more expensive, but higher quality, block space."
22076,2019-04-20 13:05:00+00:00,hasufl,@panekkkk Yes. I think you are misunderstanding the discussion you quoted. Bitcoin's base layer cannot scale to compete with existing payment processors. You cannot have cheap transactions that are at the same time broadcasted and verified by the entire network of nodes.
22077,2019-04-20 12:59:45+00:00,hasufl,@panekkkk What?!
22078,2019-04-20 12:12:29+00:00,hasufl,"@UpstairsAdagio @zhusu @Rewkang @cyounessi1 It's not at all the same. Borrowers benefit from a strong and stable dai, but only up to a certain degree. They don't save in it, they sell it immediately. So yes, dai needs a certain base network effect, but after that other factors matter a lot more to borrowers."
22079,2019-04-20 11:41:18+00:00,hasufl,@ercwl @TusharJain_ Correct
22080,2019-04-20 11:26:48+00:00,hasufl,"@MichaelKogan14 @cyounessi1 - everyone who holds dai
- everyone who owes dai"
22081,2019-04-20 11:23:08+00:00,hasufl,"@zhusu @Rewkang @cyounessi1 dai's network effect matters for two things

1) ensure demand for dai to stay near $1
2) in some rare cases, push the price of dai way over $1 to entice new CDPs to be opened

These effects matter little for the CDP creator. He is happy when he can sell his loan at a low spread."
22082,2019-04-20 11:18:58+00:00,hasufl,"@MichaelKogan14 @cyounessi1 You mean decrease supply? In theory, MKR holders can vote to force-shutdown any existing CDP. But that has never been used before"
22083,2019-04-20 11:18:01+00:00,hasufl,"@Rewkang @cyounessi1 Yes, the system is getting better. No doubt about that"
22084,2019-04-20 11:14:38+00:00,hasufl,"@MichaelKogan14 @cyounessi1 Well, that's why they are raising the stability fee. It's their lever to control demand for CDPs. That dai is under $1 should have a self-regulating effect on the system as well, because borrowers who sell dai now have to worry that it will rise again in the future."
22085,2019-04-20 11:08:32+00:00,hasufl,"@Rewkang @cyounessi1 Yeah, it's not comparable. 

I'm not saying that demand for CDP won't continue to grow, just that we can't assume that it will. Plenty of reasons: more expensive now, more competition, dai at &lt;$1 another big risk factor for borrowers"
22086,2019-04-20 10:59:39+00:00,hasufl,"@Rewkang @cyounessi1 ""2. Avg APR for personal loan is 30%+"" 

for an overcollateralized loan? Do you have any examples of that?"
22087,2019-04-20 10:55:45+00:00,hasufl,@Rewkang @cyounessi1 What makes you think we can draw proper conclusions from past growth at near zero fees to future growth at very high - likely uncompetitive - fees?
22088,2019-04-20 10:47:57+00:00,hasufl,"@cyounessi1 I just realized we have no good data to believe that demand for CDPs at the current stability fee will stay as high as it was in 2018 at a very low stability fee. And if people closed their CDPs today, they pay the new rate only for the past couple of weeks."

22093,2019-04-19 17:40:40+00:00,hasufl,@zen_bacon I think you can pay your stability fee in either MKR or dai.
22094,2019-04-19 17:21:39+00:00,hasufl,"@zen_bacon Yes, that is possible. I've heard quite a few people suspect that Maker has supported the peg via washtrading for a long time and when they stopped, it broke below $1."
22095,2019-04-19 17:19:11+00:00,hasufl,"@zen_bacon The reason the foundation owns dai is that they own MKR as well, so they are entitled to some of the stability fees. What they do with this dai isn't really of any concern, it's their profit and not required to keep the system afloat."
22096,2019-04-19 17:05:57+00:00,hasufl,"@zen_bacon Yes, that makes no sense. Maker doesn't defend the peg, CDP owners do. The treasury has nothing to do with all this"
22097,2019-04-19 17:00:11+00:00,hasufl,"@spencernoon I guess branding as a ""better bitcoin"" gets me every time as well"
22098,2019-04-19 16:56:50+00:00,hasufl,@spencernoon Listing low block time as a feature is definitely a classic
22099,2019-04-19 16:26:19+00:00,hasufl,"And we are not talking about the sum of both demand types, as in a ""dai OR CDPs"" statement. We are talking about ""dai AND CDPs"", so the intersection between the two. 

Whichever is smaller at any given time sets the cap for the entire system."
22100,2019-04-19 16:26:18+00:00,hasufl,A few months ago we wrote that demand for CDPs limits Maker's scalability when the market still believed it is limited by demand for dai. Today we can safely say that neither is fully correct. Maker is constrained by demand for BOTH dai AND CDPs.https://t.co/Vi8RecJxa0
22101,2019-04-19 16:16:32+00:00,hasufl,"@Muhd_Amrullah I know that's the point. I find it surprising they don't even give the system any time to recalibrate around the previous raise, they just immediately raise it again."
22102,2019-04-19 16:11:25+00:00,hasufl,"Boy, Maker really wants people to close their CDPs at this point. I'm surprised the last two raises haven't done the trick already. Who continues an overcollateralized loan at 14.5% p.a.?"

22565,2019-03-07 01:07:06+00:00,hasufl,Final words: Given my own and @CremeDeLaCrypto's concerns I think we might be at peak hype for Maker in relation to how much uncertainty there is around the project. Including some that might well not have any solution (decentralized oracles.)
22566,2019-03-07 01:07:05+00:00,hasufl,"As a result, demand to lever up cryptocurrency looks small, definitely not enough to grow dai to the levels from some of the crazier valuations I have seen. Maker can allow collateral with different trust-tradeoffs, but at the cost of sacrificing some of their own trustlessness."
22567,2019-03-07 01:07:05+00:00,hasufl,"In the real world, collateral is a) highly illiquid and b) retain its use value. Some examples: 1) real estate 2) inventory 3) unpaid invoices. These assets *make sense* to lever up as a business owner. Highly liquid assets? Not so much, can always just sell them instead."
22568,2019-03-07 01:07:05+00:00,hasufl,"4. Let's talk about collateral. MKR/dai are only as trustless as the collateral they use. The problem: tokens like ETH (or even BTC) are pretty damn useless as collateral once the novelty value is gone, and the demand to lever them up in a trustless way is quite limited."
22569,2019-03-07 01:07:04+00:00,hasufl,"The supply of other stablecoins is a direct function of the demand to hold them. But dai's supply is a function of demand to sell it, not to hold it, because it is created by borrowers, most of which immediately exchange it for something else."
22570,2019-03-07 01:07:04+00:00,hasufl,"3. In recent months, Maker has struggled to maintain their peg against the dollar (trading at a 3-4% discount). It is really hard to manage a system of their complexity to optimally match supply and demand of dai."
22571,2019-03-07 01:07:04+00:00,hasufl,2. Will MKR holders act in the system's best interest? They can sell their MKR at any time so they have an incentive to maximize short term returns that shareholders of public or private companies simply don't have.
22572,2019-03-07 01:07:03+00:00,hasufl,"1. The oracle problem is a big question mark for me, not just for MKR but any project that requires blockchain-external data to work. Frankly, I'm not sure it *can* be solved in a decentralized way."

- Bitcoin rebuilds trust every block
- It needs to be expensive by design
- Trusted middlemen are amazing assets 
- Bitcoin is valuable where trust should be competitive, but isn't"
22806,2019-02-14 13:46:55+00:00,hasufl,"As a result, Bitcoin's true value lies in making trust competitive. 

It's a protocol for hosting trust tournaments, and hence building trust from scratch between total strangers."
22807,2019-02-14 13:46:55+00:00,hasufl,"And that's fine because there are enough situations where middlemen cannot be trusted by definition. Why? Lack of competition.

The production of money is the prime example here. It's much harder for the market to punish a monopolist than a producer in a competitive market."
22808,2019-02-14 13:46:54+00:00,hasufl,"Tying it back together, if two parties already have a middleman they trust, then in practice they will always be better off using him instead of Bitcoin."

The tournament is only for situations where trust has to be built from scratch every time."
22810,2019-02-14 13:46:54+00:00,hasufl,"The strength of the trust is directly linked to the reward. 

This is why Bitcoin *needs* to be costly to use. (And it is also why some people are afraid Bitcoin becomes untrustworthy when rewards become smaller and smaller)."
22811,2019-02-14 13:46:54+00:00,hasufl,"The tournament process ensures that the winner has a high degree of integrity. 

But with every tournament, people only sign up if there is a sufficient reward waiting for the winner."
22812,2019-02-14 13:46:53+00:00,hasufl,"Every block, Bitcoin hosts a tournament for your trust. 

For comparison, a king hosts a series of tournaments to find new members for his king's guard. New recruits are more likely to be skilled and trustworthy if they had to endure personal hardship to get the position."
22813,2019-02-14 13:46:53+00:00,hasufl,"This is what Bitcoin solves: Lack of competition between middlemen. You're still trusting middlemen, but Bitcoin makes the middlemen prove first that they can be trusted. 

They do that by spending money before they can make money, which binds their honesty to their profit motive"
22814,2019-02-14 13:46:53+00:00,hasufl,"Trusted middlemen are extremely valuable. 

They only become problematic if there is no cost for misbehavior - for example, because there is no competition that keeps them in check."

22927,2019-02-11 13:24:42+00:00,hasufl,"Here are some more questions I would like to see answered:

1) At what size would you start calling the fund overcapitalized? Any plans on capping the fund and changing the model once that size is reached?"

22929,2019-02-11 13:24:42+00:00,hasufl,"ADL means winners pay for the losers, but it also guarantees that customers will never pay more than is needed. The insurance fund means losers pay for losers, but makes them, in theory, overpay up 10x or more for the same security. The difference goes to BitMEX as profits."
22930,2019-02-11 13:24:41+00:00,hasufl,"So the fund is arguably too big, but that's not my main concern. It is that BitMEX itself owns the fund and not an external insurer or industry consortium. If they see the fund as what it is, an asset on their balance sheet, they are incentivized to grow it as much as possible."

I see that as increasingly unlikely, especially considering that since the last considerable loss (in April 2018), the fund has grown from 4.8k to 21k BTC."
22932,2019-02-11 13:24:41+00:00,hasufl,"Better examples can be found in 2018:
16.1.2018, the fund lost 132 BTC (5% of total)

18.7.2018, the fund lost 103 BTC (1% of total)

22933,2019-02-11 13:24:41+00:00,hasufl,"So are BitMEX customers overinsured? The post gives a counterexample: In March 2017, the day the Winklevoss ETF was rejected, Bitcoin's price dropped 30% and depleted the insurance fund, causing ADL to happen.

22934,2019-02-11 13:24:40+00:00,hasufl,The insurance provided by the CME does explicitly NOT live on their own balance sheet. This is my big problem with the BitMEX insurance fund.

22935,2019-02-11 13:24:40+00:00,hasufl,"That difference in itself is totally fine, as the CME is a KYC exchange and also has more of an institutional audience. Losses can, in theory, be recouped via the legal system, which is hardly possible on a non-KYC exchange like BitMEX. 

However..."

I don't think these two can be fixed later, Etherum will at some point get harder to change so it's essential to get the direction right early."
23403,2019-01-03 13:09:39+00:00,hasufl,"@sassal0x @VitalikButerin It's interesting you mention that because my main worry about Ethereum is whether censorship-resistance can be guaranteed with the current architecture. 
1) verification becomes too costly because chain state grows too fast, more and more nodes dropping out"
23404,2019-01-03 13:01:19+00:00,hasufl,@antiprosynth @koeppelmann @VitalikButerin It's not actually so different from the DAO situation. Would people vote to censor an account that's not theirs to improve the long-term prospects of Ethereum? I think most of us would - including Bitcoiners - hence we have to eliminate such attack vectors before it happens.

I challenge VB's concrete statement that Ethereum users would let him die to save a few accounts from censorship. I say that would never happen because VB is too important within Ethereum. Maybe not to you, but to many others."

It's an interesting thought experiment whether a globally streamed hostage situation could be enough to coordinate such a change."
