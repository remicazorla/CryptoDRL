3815,2021-11-30 21:10:18+00:00,jamie247,@racrozier Inflation as a tool (the only tool) is a dangerous game because it assumes you can manage it to the point of it not slipping into hyperinflation which obviously some of those countries in the chart failed to do.
3816,2021-11-30 21:06:59+00:00,jamie247,"@racrozier Yeh agreed. I mean honestly I am not qualified to have this discussion 😂 

Who knows. But as I guess;

- People will hedge into crypto
- Govts will tax cap gains in Fiat
- Govts will take payment in crypto
- Fiats currencies become crypto backed as a standard"
3817,2021-11-30 21:04:14+00:00,jamie247,"@racrozier Yes early adopters are disproportionately rewarded

But the most valuable asset you can have in the Metaverse is time &amp; attention. 

That’s why the 15 year old will kick your ass and mine

But it is a system anyone with an internet connection can enter. It does not discriminate"
3818,2021-11-30 20:59:18+00:00,jamie247,"@racrozier But of all taxes I dislike inflation the most because it is the least fair. 

The effects of inflation not only are greater, but disproportionately greater, for poorer people.

And it is the least honest"
3819,2021-11-30 20:56:57+00:00,jamie247,"@racrozier It’s a good question. I’m not a hardcore libertarian.

I pay a good chunk of change largely though cap gains on crypto earnings. 

I don’t mind paying taxes generally at a reasonable rate. 

I mean I live in the UK not Dubai or Switzerland even though I could."
3820,2021-11-30 20:53:26+00:00,jamie247,"@racrozier and as you imply should that happen suddenly it would be a disaster and a total collapse of social order. 

My gut tells me it might allow a gradual transition by offering as a hedge for citizens to balance out the game"
3821,2021-11-30 20:49:53+00:00,jamie247,"@racrozier The reality is we can’t all exit Fiat entirely (even if we wanted to) we are bound by current models of citizenship, ownership &amp; taxation.."
3822,2021-11-30 20:47:05+00:00,jamie247,"@racrozier But honestly I don’t know how this plays out but I do know the current system of Fiat, nation states and big government is probably not it"
3823,2021-11-30 20:44:53+00:00,jamie247,@racrozier It doesn’t divorce or absolve the citizen from the particular civic deal they make with their country of residence and therefore it doesn’t require a web 3 equivalent although long term I do believe ‘DAO like’ forms of collectivism could be more effective that nation states
3824,2021-11-30 20:42:04+00:00,jamie247,@racrozier So the question is in that paradigm is it reasonable and appropriate a citizen some hold assets (crypto) that partly protect their wealth from this behaviour by governments.. I say yes.
3825,2021-11-30 20:40:21+00:00,jamie247,"@racrozier Record levels of government indebtedness (that proceeded COVID) paid for by inflation is deceitful and avoids the debate of what is actually sustainable. 

It’s also assumes organic GDP growth will be able to pay for it which may never come. And globally is likely already over."
3826,2021-11-30 20:37:27+00:00,jamie247,"@racrozier I think it’s better if politicians are obliged to rationalise taxation explicitly to their citizenship. 

Citizens can then accept that or not, vote accordingly or exit to another country."
3827,2021-11-30 20:20:24+00:00,jamie247,"@racrozier I don’t think anyone is surprised. 

But inflation is effectively taxation by misrepresentation. 

And one can exit that paradigm now."

I actually don’t feel overwhelmed by following 8k in fact a lot of it is repetition which allows you to spot patterns and the spread of memes

And where it exists I quite like the mix in the stream"

In fact it could be said I am a hoarder of peoples. 

Ive never got why some folk have hundreds of thousands of followers and follow back sub 100"
8889,2021-02-25 21:39:06+00:00,jamie247,"I actually feel bad for saying this now because you could make various false inferences from such a clumsy statement 

One should not measure ones worth by followers.

Don’t let that happen to you. Take the stage 🎤"
8925,2021-02-25 08:52:00+00:00,jamie247,"What #NFT innovators / creators need to realise is the space just got a lot more noisy &amp; competitive

No one cares if you an OG. Everyone is now an ‘expert’ and noobs flooding won’t be able to tell the difference

No point complaining about it. Just need to up your game."

How decentralised is #crypto really? 

Could Bezos switch off most #DApps?

11107,2020-10-19 21:13:31+00:00,jamie247,"@CryptoJack2 Yes I think traditional contemporary artists coming into the space is perhaps (2) and everything moves down. 

I think it will be great PR for the space, break a few records but no where near as exciting as what Metaverse ‘natives’ will create with mixed reality etc"
11108,2020-10-19 21:06:51+00:00,jamie247,@CryptoJack2 That does not mean 1) can’t and won’t make a shit tonne of money. They really will. But less over time or at least not as much as the proceeding phases

b) is what adds premium and scarcity. There fewer the people who can actually make it or the more cross discipline collaboration required the better"
11110,2020-10-19 21:03:24+00:00,jamie247,"@CryptoJack2 Personally I would say the difference between 1 &amp; 2+ 

a) themes &amp; a visual aesthetic that have mass appeal 

b) technical proficiency to produce 

ie the required mastery of technologies like motion graphics, gaming engines, machine learning algos + use of multi media"
11111,2020-10-19 20:56:21+00:00,jamie247,@itsparrott I mean given a lot of the artists I am buying are building with gaming engines it feels an obvious next step
11112,2020-10-19 20:51:03+00:00,jamie247,"The reason this is less exciting to me is it’s just a dumb asset / transaction / form collateral in my portfolio it isn’t something I can experience. 

An immersive #VR #NFT is that AND something I can jump into (ideally in a social context) the later really bringing a premium"

11115,2020-10-19 20:32:18+00:00,jamie247,@DChapmanCrypto the #metaverse will be open..

Would love to understand the underlying unit economics of an equivalent dimension of land in each virtual world today for a comparable experience."
11158,2020-10-18 11:08:57+00:00,jamie247,"@gabusch But do you think virtual real estate value is about adjacency or content? 

Because this would imply the later which dilutes the former in my head. 

People to go the content"
11159,2020-10-18 11:07:24+00:00,jamie247,"@matthewniemerg Yeh for sure. 

I guess the point is if you have great content people come to you and you can be anywhere.

Doesn’t that break the real estate model?

Then what’s next?"
11160,2020-10-18 11:04:04+00:00,jamie247,@gabusch you mean the value of the land only holds based on the economic activity it enables on top right?
11161,2020-10-18 10:59:37+00:00,jamie247,@matthewniemerg Therefore I want to optimise for the cheapest space with the highest throughout of experience
11162,2020-10-18 10:59:03+00:00,jamie247,@matthewniemerg As these virtual environments become increasingly social and experiential I don’t care about the size of the space but the throughout of what I can do in it with people
11163,2020-10-18 10:57:32+00:00,jamie247,"@matthewniemerg this simple replication of the physical world to the virtual is natural and obvious and works to bootstrap the Metaverse but I don’t think it holds long term.

Firstly I’m likely not wandering around virtual worlds I’m porting so conventional physical proximity is less relevant"
11164,2020-10-18 10:50:19+00:00,jamie247,"@Mooie_89 @AaveAave Yeh in particular bootstrapping content via borrowing against virtual land will happen. 

But ultimately it’s artificial scarcity.

Long term Web3 will remove that tax and systems will naturally align to the actual system resources required for the experience itself."
11165,2020-10-18 10:19:52+00:00,jamie247,"The point of the #Metaverse is it’s almost limitless potential

It’s not about the dimensions of space it’s about what you want to do in it surely..?"
11166,2020-10-18 10:18:31+00:00,jamie247,"I’m not convinced the biz model of artificial scarcity of real estate in virtual worlds will hold over the next 3 years

13548,2019-11-27 13:50:07+00:00,jamie247,"@PeterMcCormack @danielwingen I’m not here to defend ETH but you could make many similar arguments against why Bitcoin isn’t decentralised.

The point is: is it decentralised enough to function and I guess (for censorship resistance) the only objective measure is has a network been successfully attacked."
13549,2019-11-27 13:45:05+00:00,jamie247,@PeterMcCormack @danielwingen Pathway
13550,2019-11-27 13:44:32+00:00,jamie247,@PeterMcCormack @danielwingen So to demand or expect a nascent network out of the gate to be ‘fully decentralised’ and in the narrow context of censorship resistance is strange
13551,2019-11-27 13:42:07+00:00,jamie247,"@PeterMcCormack @danielwingen Why? You don’t codify assumptions because they make systems, especially complex systems fragile.

If you think of a protocol as a ‘startup’ until you have ‘product market fit’ you need to be able to experiment and pivot. 

You can not do that easily and be fully ‘decentralised’"
13552,2019-11-27 13:39:50+00:00,jamie247,"@PeterMcCormack @danielwingen I can agree with this. The degree &amp; form of decentralisation (say censorship resistance) comes at a cost. My point is that trade off is a design choice.  

borrowing from a decade of thinking around lean startup principles decentralisation should in many cases be a pathway.."

You might be able to say it is more or less decentralised which makes it a.. spectrum

But even then you would need to know you are comparing apples 🍏 and agree on quantifiable measures"
13557,2019-11-27 13:06:09+00:00,jamie247,@PeterMcCormack In fact likely more exact to say its a spectra
13558,2019-11-27 13:04:32+00:00,jamie247,"@PeterMcCormack Shame you are ducking the question dude. 

But it’s because the simple fact is decentralisation could and should be measured in several ways. 

Which makes it a spectrum. 

Prove me wrong."
13559,2019-11-27 12:52:19+00:00,jamie247,"@PeterMcCormack We can then discuss why internet protocols   optimising distributed networks for functions different to money would have the same design choices as Bitcoin. 

This is based on the misunderstanding all tokenised protocols are trying to be alternatives to Bitcoin."
13560,2019-11-27 12:43:00+00:00,jamie247,"@PeterMcCormack Let’s play a game: 

If decentralisation is not a spectrum it must be binary.

Fundamentally, there needs to be an entirely new data economy where data, its ownership and access is governed by the individual locally not on someone else’s servers so they can freely grant and revoke access on their own terms as they move around the web."
14146,2019-07-26 08:45:19+00:00,jamie247,This will force a paradigm change where it is not just in the interest of customers and citizens that we gain greater control of our data and its security but the commercial interests of the companies we interact with.

14999,2019-01-08 15:04:15+00:00,jamie247,"So whilst the market will likely grow modestly the main investor opportunity is in the changing of the guard in the blue-chip top 10 as fragile players are replaced with better more robust teams and projects only just coming online that chose not to ICO

(not investment advice)"
15000,2019-01-08 15:04:15+00:00,jamie247,"Combined this all brings a degree of stability to the market and should produce a slow upward trend, probably marked by a few bull runs as people misinterpret there being a return to frenzy 2018."
15001,2019-01-08 15:04:14+00:00,jamie247,"Early projects, where execution risk is greater, will be removed from public markets entirely and financed privately slowly removing the scam narrative and normalising failure to classic startup framing / ratios"
15002,2019-01-08 15:04:14+00:00,jamie247,"Now exchanges are seeking approvals, classic VCs and family offices are the primary financiers, the markets will become more conservative, integrate and normalise.

As a consequence: Exchanges will begin to actively stop wash trading and manipulation reducing volatility."
15003,2019-01-08 15:04:14+00:00,jamie247,Since the Ethereum #ICO there has been this rush with great hubris to do everything on-chain only possible whilst the community has been able to self-finance and existed in a regulatory grey frontier where leniency for all but the worst behaviour would likely be shown
15004,2019-01-08 15:04:13+00:00,jamie247,"The more I think about 2019 and see the month of Jan take shape the more I think there is a semi-bullish case to be made for #crypto

I think '19 will be 'THE YEAR OF OFF-CHAIN' &amp; MARKET NORMALISATION

Big difference between raising obscene amounts of $ without tech, let alone any traction

vs

A network in development for 2+ years, privately funded, executed on tech, got test net adoption, launching tokenised network
