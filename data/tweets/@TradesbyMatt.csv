0,2023-02-26 20:51:57+00:00,TradesByMatt,@TradersParadise 😬 good week. We will see what this next one brings
1,2023-02-26 13:55:39+00:00,TradesByMatt,🤝
2,2023-02-26 13:47:06+00:00,TradesByMatt,@I_Am_The_ICT Thanks! Going to be interesting…but should be fun! That’s the goal at least😂
3,2023-02-26 00:59:35+00:00,TradesByMatt,"Have to remember this for the World Cup of Trading. Got to pace out, plenty can happen in a year."
4,2023-02-25 22:38:07+00:00,TradesByMatt,@Tradermayne Lol I get a comment about my eyes every day as well. Good stuff
5,2023-02-25 17:05:02+00:00,TradesByMatt,"@ogpasha One more link for you which is my take on all of it and a little more on admin side of comp etc (commissions, margins, platforms) https://t.co/P4cVveLxKI"
6,2023-02-25 17:03:56+00:00,TradesByMatt,@ogpasha https://t.co/xGiKruPL0k standings data looks jacked cause of weekend but it updates every day. Comp been running since 1983
7,2023-02-25 17:01:33+00:00,TradesByMatt,@D_Man_Trades @I_Am_The_ICT He should do next year so I have a shot winning this year😉
8,2023-02-25 16:14:22+00:00,TradesByMatt,"Here’s the first stand alone video on the challenge. (Filmed early Friday morning so the account gain is different than this thread currently). I go over platform, challenge requirements etc. give it a watch and a like https://t.co/P4cVveLxKI"
9,2023-02-25 16:11:19+00:00,TradesByMatt,@Tradesdontlie But historically (last few years) 250%/350% account gain has been winning it so we will see what this year brings for it!
10,2023-02-25 16:10:34+00:00,TradesByMatt,@Tradesdontlie Thanks! Yeah I think thats a good idea. Unfortunately no “guaranteed” way to win given unknown levels of traders competing but makes sense. I plan on compounding 1 mini per 10K. Unfortunately margin requirements are high so makes it harder to do any faster. Fun so far though!
11,2023-02-24 21:16:06+00:00,TradesByMatt,@iammoezart Thanks bro! We will see what happens!
12,2023-02-24 20:35:00+00:00,TradesByMatt,@NQmonopoly I am using Dorman Clearing and then Robbins (you have to use them for their competition)
13,2023-02-24 18:43:04+00:00,TradesByMatt,@TradersParadise Join me! Actually maybe enter next year so I have a shot at it this year😉
14,2023-02-24 17:03:37+00:00,TradesByMatt,Excited to see how it plays out (whether good or bad!) and will be a massive learning experience either way. You when a trophy (so nothing much) but would still cool to have! Follow along here and on my youtube.
15,2023-02-24 17:03:37+00:00,TradesByMatt,"Current standings can be found by googling the challenge and going to Standings tab. They show the top 5 for each division, I think updated end of day."
16,2023-02-24 17:03:37+00:00,TradesByMatt,"I ended my first week in the competition at ~32% up on the account trading only 1 NQ contract the entire time. Haven't touched the ES yet. 

Main goal is to hunt the leaderboard while being patient and confident in my trades."
17,2023-02-24 17:03:36+00:00,TradesByMatt,"I am excited to see how I handle that side of the challenge as well as less leverage etc. (margin requirements are higher in the challenge)

During the challenge I am using Sierra Charts. Love it so far. Hard to setup but once good, it's awesome."
18,2023-02-24 17:03:36+00:00,TradesByMatt,It is pretty interesting so far. The hardest challenge imo is balancing being aggressive while not burning out over the year. I have done week/2 week long total profit challenges but it is much easier to hyper focus a week or 2 than stay in the game all year.
19,2023-02-24 17:03:36+00:00,TradesByMatt,"Some of the beef with the Robbins is that you can have multiple different accounts and run different strategies in them etc to get to the leaderboard.

I am only running 1 account in this challenge.

This is a third party audited live funded account."
20,2023-02-24 17:03:35+00:00,TradesByMatt,"I joined the Robbins World Cup of Trading Challenge in the Futures division and today is the end of my first week. The challenge goes from 1-1 through 12-31.

I am doing the challenge to mix things up and have some fun with it. I started with the minimum $10,000 deposit."

26,2023-02-19 20:26:34+00:00,TradesByMatt,"It now makes sense why Instagram does nothing about the hundreds of fake accounts and refusing to verify. 

They were just waiting and creating the problem to get paid."
27,2023-02-19 20:07:57+00:00,TradesByMatt,"@sweatystartup Don’t forget to add in your thought about having athletic coach upsales at each location selling the pro sports dream to dads

In all honesty though, day cares actually seem like cash cows. And every single one I have looked at has wait lists and $$$$ monthly costs"

39,2023-02-01 21:40:27+00:00,TradesByMatt,"Day trading is not for people swimming in debt. If you have credit card debt and don’t know how to pay off a card every month, don’t trade. Simple."

44,2023-01-25 13:36:52+00:00,TradesByMatt,"@Tr3ggs Agreed. Talking investment portfolio, not highly leveraged day trading."
45,2023-01-25 03:58:44+00:00,TradesByMatt,"The important follow up question. Do you underperform, on pace, or outperform the market?"
46,2023-01-25 00:53:58+00:00,TradesByMatt,Do you self manage your stock portfolio or pay someone to do it for you?
47,2023-01-20 23:23:06+00:00,TradesByMatt,@allex_640 I might like attracted more
48,2023-01-20 23:11:35+00:00,TradesByMatt,Todays stream was a good one. Love talking day trading psychology and perspective with you all. You can watch the recap with some of the discussion on my YouTube channel right now.

104,2023-01-03 21:13:25+00:00,TradesByMatt,"On any given month, you must be prepared to hit it hard  or to not take any trades and net $0. It all depends on the opportunities that emerge from the market. 

Patience. Don't force the process."
105,2023-01-03 21:13:25+00:00,TradesByMatt,"As a trader, it can be very dangerous to setout with timeline dollar goals.

As you start to trade and scale, speed of growth has to be dictated, to a large extent, by market conditions.

To force growth is almost to guarantee you’ll take trades you’ll regret."

523,2022-01-10 17:41:02+00:00,TradesByMatt,"@Dpjeezy any prop firm that you are considering giving money to etc. For me, topstep checks those questions and I have used them for years so my confidence is with them."
524,2022-01-10 17:40:25+00:00,TradesByMatt,"@Dpjeezy a lot of prop firms either never put you in a live account OR they only handle the evaluation portion and then pass you on to someone else. That is not ok imo, I want one company to own the entire lifecycle

Hope that helps answer your question. Ask yourself those when evaluating"
525,2022-01-10 17:39:02+00:00,TradesByMatt,"@Dpjeezy For me the choice of a prop firm comes down to a few things.
1. Based in the US
2. Fantastic support / able to call as well
3. Leadership is known (not anonymous)
4. Been around the longest or near it
5. Proof of withdrawals
6. Funds traders with their own money (cont.)"

527,2022-01-10 16:18:53+00:00,TradesByMatt,The last 2 trading days has allowed me to really understand (I think) the current market condition. Unfortunately sometimes the best way to understand the norm is to take a few Ls and adapt to it. Time to buckle up!

651,2021-11-08 19:43:30+00:00,TradesByMatt,Very solid advice here. I would take off #4 but everything else I back 100%

677,2021-10-26 17:13:28+00:00,TradesByMatt,"@coopgrafik Thanks for the encouragement. Days like today suck to be in front of people tbh, but I think it helps and is important"
678,2021-10-26 16:07:08+00:00,TradesByMatt,Wow what a terrible day of trading for myself. Lots to be better on moving forward. Tough one. Nice Reversal for the shorts out there. On to the next!

681,2021-10-25 15:24:43+00:00,TradesByMatt,@FrankLonghorn that laptop was a beast. It was big in size which was the biggest con. If you need a laptop I would make sure it's not too big for you otherwise just get a desktop

706,2021-09-28 15:51:17+00:00,TradesByMatt,@sweatystartup Most people are too lazy/incapable to do it themselves but the upfront transparency builds a trust and understanding they are capable of buying into. It’s an awesome case study tbh.
707,2021-09-28 14:42:58+00:00,TradesByMatt,"Got to love West Coast time. Done trading for the day at 7:30am up $771. 

Thanks for coming and hanging out in the stream! A few more technical things I need to figure out for the travel streaming setup but we are pretty much there!"

710,2021-09-27 17:50:56+00:00,TradesByMatt,@EstateRanger I use this same saying with my lawyer too. I want someone who knows the ins and outs as it’s built (because they helped build it) and grows with me.
711,2021-09-27 02:53:11+00:00,TradesByMatt,🚨 Update: NO STREAM TOMORROW! I want to enjoy one more day of vacation sleep in + I’m not set up yet lol. Stream returns Tuesday from California. See you all at market open! 🚨

716,2021-09-25 22:27:11+00:00,TradesByMatt,@nickk254 Honestly! Trying to get us committed to international flight only for the real fit to happen😂
717,2021-09-25 21:45:42+00:00,TradesByMatt,"Update: The baby slept literally the entire flight and didn’t make a peep. 

Don’t be afraid to live life with a new baby! They will surprise you and you’ll be so happy you did the trip/experience."
718,2021-09-25 17:41:31+00:00,TradesByMatt,Low key feel like a thread on traveling with babies would blow up on Twitter. It’s the great unknown until you’re in it.
719,2021-09-23 22:34:08+00:00,TradesByMatt,"@Wayne0708 simple, I was not trading Topstep today lol"
720,2021-09-23 15:25:28+00:00,TradesByMatt,@iammoezart Yep. Top ticked exit. Hate to see it but is what it is. No revenge trading for me today
721,2021-09-23 15:23:46+00:00,TradesByMatt,Today was one of those days that just got away from me. Wasn't seeing the market clearly and gave back the week of gains. Sucks to happen but unfortunately happens time to time to pretty much anyone who trades. Main goal is to be better on Monday than today and to always improve!
722,2021-09-22 14:50:44+00:00,TradesByMatt,@SullyBusiness Easy. My dogs. Lots of toy and food sponsorships on the way. Crazy what a few viral videos will get you. https://t.co/03UisSoXHz?
723,2021-09-22 14:36:40+00:00,TradesByMatt,Nothing beats being done 30 minutes into the day. Bottom ticked the V bottom on stream today and let it run. See you all tomorrow for the last stream before we move the stream to California!
724,2021-09-22 01:32:00+00:00,TradesByMatt,Nothing better than evening golf in Texas. “Cold front” blowing in felt so good today. First time filming and had an absolute blast.

730,2021-09-21 01:11:23+00:00,TradesByMatt,Going to be filming a round of golf with the boys tomorrow. Should be a good time. Will be very relatable for those of you that shoot mid 80s and higher and are in it for the hangs! Stay tuned for it! I won’t have ball tracers this vid but maybe next🤔 https://t.co/I9XXsDRbre

I have gotten better about ignoring the trolls which helps the videos stay up (always deleted when the hate was nonstop)

At the end of the day we are all just trying to be the best versions of ourselves!"
736,2021-09-20 22:12:51+00:00,TradesByMatt,@deucyjuicy Good! Glad you are finding value in his videos (as you should if you are watching). Have a good one!

738,2021-09-20 21:11:50+00:00,TradesByMatt,@deucyjuicy Traders v traders is dumb. We are all(I think) going for the same goal here which is to make epic communities and trade well. Lets do that and focus on it. Everything else is pointless imo. I'm not to prideful for an apology but im not wasting any more time (8 months later) on it
739,2021-09-20 21:09:46+00:00,TradesByMatt,"@deucyjuicy Look man I got no beef with Vinny or any of his community. He donated to charity which I thanked him for (and continue to cause epic). I'm sorry I called him a shill, in the moment it felt as if he was donating in order to advertise. Vinny if you are reading cheers"

742,2021-09-20 20:26:51+00:00,TradesByMatt,@vstolyarov You’re not wrong. This was also a joke tweet lol.
743,2021-09-20 20:26:13+00:00,TradesByMatt,@deucyjuicy Despite popular belief (to him) I actually don’t hate him in the slightest. Got no beef with him actually (on my side). For some reason he thinks we do. I’m all for any trader pushing other traders to be their best.
744,2021-09-20 18:57:31+00:00,TradesByMatt,"I added /s but according to my DMs I need to also say ""This is a JOKE""! Red days happen, markets are dipping and retracing about a month so far, and we are all going to be alright haha"

749,2021-09-20 02:07:41+00:00,TradesByMatt,Great story here
750,2021-09-19 16:36:32+00:00,TradesByMatt,@SullyBusiness Don’t be scared to go out and do things like you normally would (parks/travel/eating places). Seen too many people scared to do this early on with their kids. Imo earlier the better to get used to normal life again + it’s fun to bring your baby places!
751,2021-09-19 04:01:11+00:00,TradesByMatt,@ZackHonarvar Distance is greatest factor here. The other thing on private planes is it’s always per leg. So a trip from Austin to Vegas for instance is 20K each way for 7 seats.

I look forward to collaborating with you on stream about ideas and strategies as well as different markets to trade. See you there!"
1034,2021-06-05 19:42:11+00:00,TradesByMatt,The low volume/volatility of the Summer is a great place to give this a try and I am excited to learn from the failures and successes and to see how we can integrate some of these learnings into the full size account!
1035,2021-06-05 19:42:10+00:00,TradesByMatt,"This Summer I plan on trying new strategies used by the community as well as things I have been wanting to try but didn't want to risk on my normal account. I will also be following a scaling plan of 1 micro per $1,000 (This will change in relation to the new FairX futures)"
1036,2021-06-05 19:42:10+00:00,TradesByMatt,"I want to do this for a few reasons. Hopefully to continue to build the community and get someone new into trading, but also to give myself some freedom to try some new things without the consequences being detrimental if things go poorly"
1037,2021-06-05 19:42:09+00:00,TradesByMatt,"The goal of this challenge is to take $2,000 (I feel this is a relatable number for those of you joining in or cashing a funded account to join in) and grow it all summer long (hopefully). I will take it high or go down with the ship, all trades will be on the stream."
1038,2021-06-05 19:42:09+00:00,TradesByMatt,"In this new Season, I will be doing a small account challenge. I have been seeing many people on Youtube doing these lately and I want to join in on the fun (i.e. @TradersParadise gg btw)"
1039,2021-06-05 19:42:08+00:00,TradesByMatt,"Monday marks the return on stream and the NEW ""Summer Season"" aka Season 1 on my channel. 

The goal of this is to begin a new journey with you all. As many traders know, the Summer is normally a time where things slow down and volatility falls off a bit"
1040,2021-06-05 19:42:07+00:00,TradesByMatt,"THE RETURN

This Monday 6/7 at 8:20am CT, we are back LIVE on Youtube. 

This break spending time with my newborn daughter has been incredible and I will always remember these first few weeks with her. 

Coming back, we are doing things a little differently this summer👇"

1059,2021-05-28 14:32:44+00:00,TradesByMatt,@atxREpodcast Yeah always have been curious on that. Zillow has shown my house going from 590-830 the past year and 2 months in 78704...and that’s without the kitchen remodel and other improvements so was trying to get a gauge on realism lol
1060,2021-05-28 14:28:26+00:00,TradesByMatt,@atxREpodcast How accurate do you find Zillow estimate pricing to be?

1156,2021-05-03 15:14:52+00:00,TradesByMatt,Switching to micros in prep for baby being born and for the new schedule with her. I want to be in a spot where I am good leaving at any point needed (not having to be stressed cause of drawdown and needing to go to hospital) and where I’m trading less size while on less sleep

1319,2021-03-31 21:59:23+00:00,TradesByMatt,This has been fascinating to see and honestly hasn't really produced much in my scene until the last few weeks through the form of donations. It is interesting to see how people react to gaming streams / vs value add streams and what people find to be fair. Interesting case study

1330,2021-03-29 23:24:27+00:00,TradesByMatt,@A1SteakSawce Different styles of trading on longer moves maybe. I trade minis 99% of the time though so I’m the wrong person to ask about micros tbh

1412,2021-03-12 14:38:02+00:00,TradesByMatt,@matthewesp @sweatystartup Yeah courses make tons of sense in pretty much every aspect of life OTHER than trading due to the 16 year old kids taking away all credibility for future online courses. Honestly a bummer because if done correctly could be huge but it’s already got a bad taste in peoples mouth
1413,2021-03-11 23:42:04+00:00,TradesByMatt,@capitalcainer Excited to hear your experience with this. Been thinking about it myself
1414,2021-03-10 19:39:32+00:00,TradesByMatt,Congrats! Keep the risk tight and the leverage low! Community is winning!

1558,2021-02-08 22:03:13+00:00,TradesByMatt,I think my trading the past 6 months has gone parabolic (in a good way) due to pressing super hard and then taking regular breaks (travel/rest/vacation). I wasn’t able to take these breaks while 9-5 working and it has made a huge differences in my trading/focus/drive. Recommend

1693,2021-01-25 17:36:54+00:00,TradesByMatt,"@MykeSmith Comparison is the number 1 killer imo. You see someone who made 1K when you made 500 so you want to push for it or it just makes you sad. Not worth it. Same thing on losing side making you feel better than you are. No place for either, the problem is people still want to see all"
1694,2021-01-25 17:30:53+00:00,TradesByMatt,Applies to every area of life.
1695,2021-01-25 16:58:21+00:00,TradesByMatt,"@chartmonkey_ @Alex42172806 ""difficult""...just hard on Topstep..actually currently having my best day of 2021 on personal😂 Trading is weird."
1696,2021-01-25 16:54:29+00:00,TradesByMatt,"If you live your life comparing PnLs, not only are you wasting your time not making your own money, you will be continuously sad because someone will always be making more than you. Best to just stay in your own lane and always try to improve day over day!"

1698,2021-01-25 16:42:10+00:00,TradesByMatt,@Alex42172806 yeah was very fast...all good though. Will be doing the combine journey on stream again starting feb 1 and will continue to bounce personal on stream sometimes as well like I have been doing.

1700,2021-01-25 16:32:03+00:00,TradesByMatt,"sad on Topstep account, very very happy on personal...just the way life works and also exactly why I trade Topstep...to keep some risk off the table.

1701,2021-01-25 14:11:10+00:00,TradesByMatt,@justice32926 Yeah fun to watch since I missed the party but it’s crazy
1702,2021-01-25 13:24:44+00:00,TradesByMatt,Almost the HARDEST thing in a market like this is having ENOUGH money to participate in it all. Having to pick and chose where you want size is no bueno when everything is ripping and opportunity cost is king.
1703,2021-01-25 13:22:45+00:00,TradesByMatt,"@MikeCBamber I'll be honest here...I think the people buying hard into these  are actually real accounts...maybe a few fakeys out there, but I think majority are real. Takes some action to make all these pump to heaven"
1704,2021-01-25 13:13:42+00:00,TradesByMatt,There are many people out there putting entire life savings into this only to have it increase 50% in the premarket. Everything is fine🙃 market is healthy🙃 stonks only go up🙃
1705,2021-01-25 13:12:26+00:00,TradesByMatt,"People WILL get left holding massive bags at the top of $GME, but until that day comes, people are getting VERY rich. The real question is will they lock it in or let greed take over? Stay tuned..."
1706,2021-01-25 13:02:49+00:00,TradesByMatt,Wow $GME looking like a 50% gap up. $amc and $bb with the big gaps also. $NQ_F straight parabolic the past week. Crazy times

1711,2021-01-24 15:07:39+00:00,TradesByMatt,@TFlinn22 Basically nonexistent for stocks. I like it for futures because I’m scalping super quick and it can change based off orders. I don’t see that in stocks and length of trade is much longer
1712,2021-01-24 13:58:44+00:00,TradesByMatt,Appears I’ll be watching both $AMC and $BB this week on stocks

1825,2021-01-06 18:19:00+00:00,TradesByMatt,@1snipertrader @Emmonspired @Balchw379 @PatrickTunni @patrickrooney at the end of the day this entire conversation comes down to 1. how can we change ourselves mentally to come ready to go every morning. 2. How can our order mgmt (not strat) change with the market. These things are agnostic of what account since rules should be rules on DD
1826,2021-01-06 18:18:48+00:00,TradesByMatt,@1snipertrader @Emmonspired @Balchw379 @PatrickTunni @patrickrooney Was just typing this up. Cont.

Even if I did, would have saved me 3K just closing right before the max loss and moving on with my day. They are there for a reason."
1828,2021-01-06 18:06:33+00:00,TradesByMatt,@Emmonspired @Balchw379 @PatrickTunni @patrickrooney Don’t know don’t care. I spend too much time focusing on my own accounts to worry about what everyone else is doing with their time
1829,2021-01-06 18:05:10+00:00,TradesByMatt,@Balchw379 @Emmonspired @PatrickTunni @patrickrooney Played by the rules. At some point I will ask for bump but I’m not there yet I don’t think. I don’t want to mentally F myself by thinking I have more room or something when I frankly don’t need it
1830,2021-01-06 18:01:49+00:00,TradesByMatt,Unpopular opinion: Just because you really want to be a day trader doesn't mean you have the right build for it. You could stay consistent on time and desire and still be unprofitable in the end. This is why it is good to have backup plans for when you realize it finally
1831,2021-01-06 17:58:05+00:00,TradesByMatt,"$ES_F savage move across markets on rip but look at yesterday VAL hold and send it almost 80 points into ATH in 12 hours or so, insane https://t.co/Tv98JdzF0S"
1832,2021-01-06 17:52:48+00:00,TradesByMatt,@Emmonspired @PatrickTunni @patrickrooney Yep exactly and 100% changes trading and the way you see things. Need that daily meditation to get right
1833,2021-01-06 17:42:52+00:00,TradesByMatt,@Emmonspired @PatrickTunni @patrickrooney Emotional capital is important and if you can find that mental stability before trading I *think* it will help a ton. Good luck
1834,2021-01-06 17:42:23+00:00,TradesByMatt,@Emmonspired @PatrickTunni @patrickrooney That’s fair enough. Same situation as a small account tbh. Got to keep an eye on that max DD when working small or on TS. I will say the rules will help if you let them. Good luck on your journey in demo and back to finding. Change what isn’t working and find that inner peace
1835,2021-01-06 17:32:17+00:00,TradesByMatt,"@Emmonspired @patrickrooney Just trying to help, not roast. I speak for everyone on twitter saying we want to see you get out of the headspace and current reality you are in"

1837,2021-01-06 17:27:41+00:00,TradesByMatt,@Emmonspired @patrickrooney That’s my point. I don’t see how scaling in more contracts would help on a trendy day like today.

1859,2021-01-05 02:33:24+00:00,TradesByMatt,Shoutout to my wife watching the Bachelor and giving me some time with my thoughts and Shiner Bock to think about our industry a bit.
1860,2021-01-05 02:32:25+00:00,TradesByMatt,"Trading should be fun, no one is forcing you to do this and the fact we are given an opportunity for something new everyday is incredible. Have fun with it, it is after all your life."
1861,2021-01-05 02:32:25+00:00,TradesByMatt,Losing is the fastest way to learn aka paying for your education. Losing is highly looked down on (because they want you to buy their course cause they dont lose) but should really be embraced and studied even though it sucks. Losing pays for itself when you learn what not to do.
1862,2021-01-05 02:32:25+00:00,TradesByMatt,"Trading is not meant for everyone. Period. Some people's brains are able to process and make decisions fast and others are not which is ok, there a million industries out there for you to be an expert in."
1863,2021-01-05 02:32:24+00:00,TradesByMatt,"Trading is a business and will have expenses (commissions, platforms, losing days). You have to pay to play."
1864,2021-01-05 02:32:24+00:00,TradesByMatt,"Trading accounts and savings should be VERY separated (not financial advice, go ask for help if you need it). Full time trading should rely on BOTH being well funded with emergency plans in place in order to save emotional capital down the road."
1865,2021-01-05 02:32:24+00:00,TradesByMatt,"""Risk Management"" is in the eyes of the beholder. True risk management looks different for everyone and comes down to Funding and Emotional capital at play. There is no ""right way"" to do this. i.e. risk mgmt for a 20 yr retirement plan looks different than risk mgmt for 70 yr old"
1866,2021-01-05 02:32:24+00:00,TradesByMatt,You will take losses. You will take losses larger than you originally planned. No one wants to show this because it hurts their course sales but it is one of the true things in our business. Got to put up money to make money.
1867,2021-01-05 02:32:23+00:00,TradesByMatt,Emotional Capital is some of the only true individual alpha left.
1868,2021-01-05 02:32:23+00:00,TradesByMatt,"Sizing up is one of the most dangerous things for a trader. Comes back to the best way to be a better trader is to have a large account, sucky, but true. Stay underlevaged!"
1869,2021-01-05 02:32:23+00:00,TradesByMatt,Most of what you see on Twitter/Youtube is not the full picture for that individual on both the profit side and the loss side. Take everyone and everything with a grain of salt.
1870,2021-01-05 02:32:23+00:00,TradesByMatt,"There are great traders that use stoplosses. There are great traders that do not use a stoploss. Figure out what YOUR brain prefers and run with it, no need to try and convert other traders to your way of thinking."
1871,2021-01-05 02:32:23+00:00,TradesByMatt,"No paid course, chat, or livestream will give you the tools you need to make money in 90 days. Go to ""school"" and be ok with the time it takes to pick things up. You don't want a lawyer or doctor practicing in 90 days so what makes you think you should make the same in less time?"
1872,2021-01-05 02:32:22+00:00,TradesByMatt,The markets don't give participation medals. Just because you are participating does not give you the right to think you should be rich. Be humble or get humbled.
1873,2021-01-05 02:32:22+00:00,TradesByMatt,"Your ""alpha or edge"" is also someone else's alpha. There are no new things in the market, just new ways of executing them. Helping out a fellow trader will not make you lose your edge even though 95% of people think it will. You are a baby fish trying to help other baby fish."
1874,2021-01-05 02:32:22+00:00,TradesByMatt,"There is no magic sauce way of trading. You will find people that make money scalping, swinging, never selling, always shorting, etc. Someone somewhere made more money doing something totally different than you, and that is OK."
1875,2021-01-05 02:32:22+00:00,TradesByMatt,"Stop paying for livestream trading, chat rooms, etc. There are free communities not built on the back of your dollar. Use the extra money for trading in your account."
1876,2021-01-05 02:32:21+00:00,TradesByMatt,"Hindsight is ALWAYS perfect. If someone has no skin in the game and talks in the past instead of present, run away! Best place to learn trading (both what to do and not) is from someone doing it, not just drawing lines on a chart."
1877,2021-01-05 02:32:21+00:00,TradesByMatt,"Most failure from trading is not from picking a wrong move, it is from being overleveraged and underfunded. Quickest way to be good at trading is have a larger trading account while remaining underleveraged. 
This can be done through prop firms or working another job while saving"
1878,2021-01-05 02:32:21+00:00,TradesByMatt,"Heavy capital is needed to make it in trading, small accounts *can* work, but odds of strikeout are incredibly high.

2013,2020-12-15 17:17:03+00:00,TradesByMatt,"This is an ideal short setup in my book. Short the test of the bottom of the range with decreasing Delta, no Delta push, and ride out the short (in this example a move of 70 points in a few minutes).
 (11/12)"
2014,2020-12-15 17:17:03+00:00,TradesByMatt,Here you see CD remain flat (no buyers) while price pushes up to the bottom of the previous range we just broke. (10/12)
2015,2020-12-15 17:17:02+00:00,TradesByMatt,"Now in this picture a few minutes later, we see the lower highs are maintained on both the 1min and CD charts and then we finally broke out of the range. 
Maybe you were short leading into this break. But the second big entry comes where the arrow is marked. (9/12) https://t.co/bHepq0atMY"
2016,2020-12-15 17:17:01+00:00,TradesByMatt,"Once we see this situtation start to unfold, we can immediately know that we should NOT be trying to long the bottom of the range, we should instead be shorting the pops and top of the range due to sellers beginning to own the move. (8/12)"
2017,2020-12-15 17:17:01+00:00,TradesByMatt,Both of these highs still fall within the consolidation range but we are able to see that sellers are in control of this move from this point on since buyers are failing to bring CD to a new high and the 1min price to new highs. (7/12)
2018,2020-12-15 17:17:01+00:00,TradesByMatt,"Take a look at this chart, paying attention to the highs noted on both CD and the 1min $NQ_F chart.

On this picture I have noted two lower highs on both the 1min chart AND the CD chart. (6/12) https://t.co/BYXtMFEMn8"
2019,2020-12-15 17:17:00+00:00,TradesByMatt,"If CD is truly flat, neither side is favored and one should sit out.
The higher probability for trading comes from going WITH the side that is favored, that way you are on the correct side of the breakout, even if you are just scalping.
 (5/12)"
2020,2020-12-15 17:17:00+00:00,TradesByMatt,"Most range traders will try and play both ends of a range, shorting the tops and longing the bottoms.
When you introduce CD into your trading strategy, you will notice that one side (long or short) will be favored in a range.  (4/12)"
2021,2020-12-15 17:17:00+00:00,TradesByMatt,"One of the most challenging setups to trade (for me) is a range day where the time charts look to be both bullish and bearish. 
There is a way to trade this that puts you at a higher probability of success for when(not if) the breakout occurs. (3/12)"
2022,2020-12-15 17:17:00+00:00,TradesByMatt,Cumulative Delta is one of the main drivers in my trading strategy. It is measuring the change in market order pressure on the buy and sell side. (2/12)

2256,2020-11-16 00:38:11+00:00,TradesByMatt,@t3mpoz Nice! I didn't see that they added the other ones as well... Will be playing by ear but I could see myself blasting all 3 challenges as well
2257,2020-11-16 00:36:29+00:00,TradesByMatt,"@sovier @Emmonspired @Tradovate I said I would be looking for a backup to Tradovate which I still am. All problems last week were sim only so don’t really apply, as I said here on twitter and on stream every day after I found out lol"
2258,2020-11-15 23:20:25+00:00,TradesByMatt,"@Emmonspired @Tradovate yeah sim only right now, word on the street is funded will come. Really just for a good time and some bragging rights, I plan on either copying trades to it or trading some minis and then hammering the micros challenge on stream for that day"
2259,2020-11-15 23:17:59+00:00,TradesByMatt,Sign up for the first challenge starting in 1 day here! https://t.co/r6e7dWEuH0

2263,2020-11-13 13:47:02+00:00,TradesByMatt,Friday the 13th trading vibes going down today https://t.co/hyhX6oW86L
2264,2020-11-13 02:18:18+00:00,TradesByMatt,o dang tomorrow we have Friday the 13th trading vibes...
2265,2020-11-13 02:08:22+00:00,TradesByMatt,A video for you to enjoy tonight. See you all on stream tomorrow morning for some Friday vibes. https://t.co/HYErlDKrkV
2266,2020-11-13 00:44:06+00:00,TradesByMatt,"@robjceo Who said playing games lol. I’m not here to play games, I make money. My goal with trading = income and time. I have both those off stream which allows me to enjoy on stream trading in different variations"
2267,2020-11-13 00:36:38+00:00,TradesByMatt,"@lander_port Benefit viewers sure, it’s also just fun to do these every now and then and to have a “challenge for yourself”. As far as my income, mostly make off stream anyways for obvious reasons"
2268,2020-11-13 00:35:09+00:00,TradesByMatt,"@mkt_trader Of course, I will say the goal of not doing it with Topstep would to be a little more liberal but at end of day, goal is to grow it so somethings must be hard lined"
2269,2020-11-13 00:34:12+00:00,TradesByMatt,"@mikebuysstocks I think growing an account is useful (stay motivated and have goals etc) but at the end of the day income is king. You wouldn’t go 10,000 to 2 million in 6 months at your job correct"
2270,2020-11-13 00:33:01+00:00,TradesByMatt,@callingelisha I think personality but also life circumstances. If you’re in debt and you see guru adds on YouTube you think you’ll get rich and have life changed quicker and hold onto that...maybe (just thinking)
2271,2020-11-13 00:19:23+00:00,TradesByMatt,Talked on stream about a micro only small account “challenge” where we try and grow it to x. Haven’t done one of these in forever but could be a good time and super challenging to get done. Should it happen?
2272,2020-11-13 00:16:34+00:00,TradesByMatt,Might make a video on this thought and🤔
2273,2020-11-13 00:16:03+00:00,TradesByMatt,"The sooner you learn trading isn’t a get rich quick but really a grind of a journey that actually takes time, the better"
2274,2020-11-12 19:00:09+00:00,TradesByMatt,@paul051966 Well done!
2275,2020-11-12 16:54:36+00:00,TradesByMatt,"+$509 trading Only Micros today on the stream... max size 4 lots at one point. Felt good to have low risk on the table and to be able to see the market clearly while still getting a bag. Thanks for watching if you did, and if not, tune in tomorrow!"

2285,2020-11-11 14:05:00+00:00,TradesByMatt,UI on Tradovate is so much better than motivewave.... still eyeing TT as a potential backup/main. Tradovate just needs to fix the data load on chart and I'll be happy with that +1 backup.
2286,2020-11-11 13:58:05+00:00,TradesByMatt,Micros today on the potential low volume. come hangout  https://t.co/HYD6xLrQcy

2288,2020-11-10 17:52:50+00:00,TradesByMatt,"@lander_port @MotiveWave Yeah...pretty crazy honestly. Internet in a nut shell though, as well as humanity. Everyone wants free and easy"
2289,2020-11-10 13:57:55+00:00,TradesByMatt,"Going over and trying out @MotiveWave today on stream...going to be looking at the platform, additional features, order management, etc. https://t.co/QI8dbiDm7L"
2290,2020-11-10 02:20:11+00:00,TradesByMatt,@RealEdgeClear My application is already waiting for you in the morning:) please reach out with any next steps!

2292,2020-11-10 01:34:03+00:00,TradesByMatt,@OnlyFutures @MotiveWave @IBKR @NinjaTrader Not what im looking for these days. Left them over a year ago with no intention of returning

2295,2020-11-10 01:16:26+00:00,TradesByMatt,"Again, I understand I was not affected and it was sim only, but nothing wrong with locking cash after some good wins"
2296,2020-11-10 01:08:31+00:00,TradesByMatt,Given the news today I did withdraw my profits from Friday and today in my Topstep Funded Account. Cash is king and I don’t mess around with unknowns. Still leaving some to play and have my other Tradovate account but again looking at Motive on stream tomorrow.
2297,2020-11-10 01:01:30+00:00,TradesByMatt,@Bayside_Zach Thought that was 1 year paid upfront when I was looking through briefly...silly me lol
2298,2020-11-10 01:00:15+00:00,TradesByMatt,@iammoezart Incredible!
2299,2020-11-10 00:23:12+00:00,TradesByMatt,@whoisAdamSmith @MotiveWave Nothing for me. I wasn’t affected
2300,2020-11-09 23:03:22+00:00,TradesByMatt,"@wesnemitz Yeah agreed. I’ll be going a different broker route. I will say, I didn’t have any trouble today, but everyone was blowing up about it. Even if I didn’t have any trouble this time, doesn’t mean I’ll be as lucky next time. Would rather be proactive than reactive on this issue"
2301,2020-11-09 22:45:17+00:00,TradesByMatt,@Bayside_Zach I am eyeing motivewave...thanks for the recommendation. I wish they had a lifetime option but other than that the orderflow package is looking real real nice to me
2302,2020-11-09 22:19:12+00:00,TradesByMatt,"@lander_port It did, they sent an email out about it"

2309,2020-11-09 02:48:57+00:00,TradesByMatt,Ended up coming back to the screen for a bit. Hit a few more bangers on this lazy Sunday night on the $NQ_F. Don't forget to tune in tomorrow morning https://t.co/N7WKSm9YwK

2312,2020-11-08 02:49:41+00:00,TradesByMatt,@RealBrianWatt Was telling a friend this. Ready to unfollow the man
2313,2020-11-08 02:15:56+00:00,TradesByMatt,"@CouRageJD @boosterich This. And at the end of the day if you really need the extra money being taken away from taxes, work more and make more. Be a capitalist. Don’t complain when at the end of the day it hardly changes anyone’s lives anyways"
2314,2020-11-07 14:54:11+00:00,TradesByMatt,@Emmonspired Most brokers are back to normal. At least get 1 account with a standard broker for quick margin changes
2315,2020-11-07 13:51:54+00:00,TradesByMatt,About to have to hire a full time Korean to English translator to translate comments and speech for YouTube. Anyone interested? This is only like 15% a joke lol

2509,2020-10-01 01:39:33+00:00,TradesByMatt,"@TFlinn22 Nope, point of the stream is to build community and find like minded traders. Combine is a good route to do that in a lower risk perspective, but that is not the goal of the stream and never will be."
2510,2020-10-01 01:06:13+00:00,TradesByMatt,Insane month🙌🏼 let’s finish 2020 strong

2517,2020-09-30 02:20:41+00:00,TradesByMatt,Nights like tonight are the real reason I’m on twitter. So funny scrolling through my timeline #Debates2020
2518,2020-09-29 21:16:21+00:00,TradesByMatt,Trading Lunch has been more profitable than first 2 hour trading the last week for me. Taking notes on conditions for improvements
2519,2020-09-29 11:58:04+00:00,TradesByMatt,@TraderTom16 @optionsmonk2 I 100% agree with this.
2520,2020-09-29 00:51:34+00:00,TradesByMatt,"Now of course we aim for every trade, every day, every week, and every month be profitable, but be practical and play the long game. Just saying all this to help us all remember"
2521,2020-09-29 00:47:32+00:00,TradesByMatt,If you make 50k each month for 6 months in a row and scratch 6 months in a row you’re still up for the year. See the bigger picture and stop getting caught up on the micro level.
2522,2020-09-29 00:45:52+00:00,TradesByMatt,"I see a lot of new traders focused on immediate gratification. They are focused on today and today only. Trades today matter, sure, but your track record is what matters more. Play the long game."

2524,2020-09-28 22:43:33+00:00,TradesByMatt,@optionsmonk2 Losing is no big deal as long as you respect your Daily loss IMO. Everything else is discretion based on styles and opionions so I disagree with your need to keep them small (which even then is relative to each person)
2525,2020-09-28 22:34:13+00:00,TradesByMatt,"I have said this a million times, but if you don’t know how to take some drawdown or a loss and bounce back with a clear head, you’re in the wrong industry. If you can’t lose mentally, you will lose financially."
2526,2020-09-28 22:30:09+00:00,TradesByMatt,I have found the saying of “90% of traders fail” to be true purely from reading the idiotic responses/comments to my tweets and live trading. It’s pretty easy to figure out who will last and won’t based off what people say. Closed minded people will not last

2547,2020-09-16 20:22:14+00:00,TradesByMatt,"Comparison of win size, loss size, and contracts traded are going to be different for every single trader! Getting worked up because someone trades more size or less size or makes more or loses more than you doesn’t matter. We just have to stay in our lane!"
2548,2020-09-16 14:21:49+00:00,TradesByMatt,Stock Talk going down in a little over a hour. This is where we talk long term investing and portfolio management as a group. Will be epic https://t.co/EcmbowKuvg
2549,2020-09-16 09:35:41+00:00,TradesByMatt,@wesnemitz Yeah I would never personally use them for futures or trading for that matter given the reviews of crashing. Seems to be a good platform for Stock Talk though and our watchlist/portfolio management
2550,2020-09-15 22:42:39+00:00,TradesByMatt,"Think or Swim all set up for the future Stock Talk streams. Funny enough, I have never used it so will be a little work in progress the first couple days poking around. VERY excited for this journey with you all, big things coming for the Team"

2554,2020-09-15 16:26:46+00:00,TradesByMatt,Super successful first stream of Stock Talk. The idea behind this is long term investing and using all of our brains to find good picks! It will be fun to have this every day after the trading stream and to watch the portfolio grow!

The pnl is important (because it’s my job) but the passion/hobby side makes up for it on down days and keeps me motivated to always be improving. You have to LOVE it to endure it"
2594,2020-09-03 18:09:32+00:00,TradesByMatt,"People want to be always be seen as the best and perfect, human nature I guess. But this is not reality (I.e. where is the pain you took (drawdowns or stops) in order to “call the top”? Very few show this, and are the only ones deserving respect imo)"
2595,2020-09-03 18:06:47+00:00,TradesByMatt,I see a lot of people patting themselves on the back for “calling the top” 👀 the Trader’s universe/community is a very weird place filled with people who feel they must be right all the time. No other industry like this I have ever seen

2606,2020-09-01 16:24:39+00:00,TradesByMatt,There are thousands of trading strategies that work and make money. Just because someone doesn’t use your specific strat doesn’t make them a bad trader needing conversion. Something to remember as we talk with each other. If it makes money for YOU then do it!

2617,2020-08-31 20:37:47+00:00,TradesByMatt,You get an ATH and you get an ATH and you get an ATH
2618,2020-08-31 17:32:33+00:00,TradesByMatt,and ANOTHER day of new ATH for $NQ_F...insane but what can you do other than ride with it? Trend is your Friend

Let’s get the bag this week Team! It’s almost game time."
2623,2020-08-30 17:44:47+00:00,TradesByMatt,@andymilonakis Didn’t know you live in Austin. Come hangout on my stream sometime! South downtown
2624,2020-08-30 14:54:28+00:00,TradesByMatt,"@Tradermayne @AliCripToe Not sure if you are actually buying off Amazon, but I got most of my build from here. You can get a better GPU for less money listed in your list. Give it a peak, this thing CRUSHES https://t.co/w7NISzcNOW"
2625,2020-08-29 23:02:36+00:00,TradesByMatt,"@Tradermayne Just built my first PC as a beefy trading/streaming machine. Don’t be intimidated, it’s a lot easier than you would think. YouTube showed me how step by step!"
2626,2020-08-29 02:04:27+00:00,TradesByMatt,@CouRageJD 1000 new today alone? Gah damn
2627,2020-08-28 22:46:41+00:00,TradesByMatt,@wesnemitz Still need to make the video! But been streaming with it for about 3 weeks (even though I have been using old settings erg!) you will notice a major quality jump on Monday!
2628,2020-08-28 22:35:56+00:00,TradesByMatt,So my stream should be very very clear on Monday. Realized I still was using settings from the old Pc 🤦‍♂️ fingers crossed!
2629,2020-08-28 21:27:31+00:00,TradesByMatt,@pipelinegg Sponsor by @GFuelEnergy or @redbull to go with my 600viewers every morning 😬
2630,2020-08-28 16:11:21+00:00,TradesByMatt,Gold! Ended stream red and walked out feeling decent. Have a great weekend! https://t.co/CKpSgGbi6D
2631,2020-08-28 12:51:12+00:00,TradesByMatt,Live in 30 mminutes! What better way to spend your Friday morning watching the markets with the team?! https://t.co/j2b8I72xeQ
2632,2020-08-28 00:00:02+00:00,TradesByMatt,"@whoisAdamSmith But agreed, could potentially be shorter"
2633,2020-08-27 23:59:50+00:00,TradesByMatt,"@whoisAdamSmith I mean if everyone is paying 100-200 to get in, we get 200-500 people in the comp, that would be worth my time lol"
2634,2020-08-27 23:47:03+00:00,TradesByMatt,"@whoisAdamSmith Like the idea of the 1000. I would push for 30 days. Allows for more movement in the top tier traders. Traders could pull back, catchup, go down etc. plus 30 days straight is nuts!"
2635,2020-08-27 23:46:07+00:00,TradesByMatt,@TeribleTreasury @earn2trade I agree on the last part! However I’m not in for it to be nested within a combine. Looking for something stand alone!
2636,2020-08-27 23:35:17+00:00,TradesByMatt,"Ohhh!!! Let’s get it. Looking forward to this. @weis_brian please let me know if you need any outside help making this happen, will help where I can cause I think it would be a blast for all traders"
2637,2020-08-27 23:34:18+00:00,TradesByMatt,I am saying sim cause legal reasons (have literally no backing for this) but if normal accounts are allowed maybe it’s just a 2K account balance entry and you work up. Largest balance at end wins. Lots of ideas here but I think all of them would be a blast
2638,2020-08-27 23:32:58+00:00,TradesByMatt,@quadzilla_jr @Tradovate @TopstepTrader @weis_brian Yeah that’s a good idea as well. Was trying to keep it even playing field but this way allows for the degens to come out😈
2639,2020-08-27 23:29:38+00:00,TradesByMatt,@Tradovate @TopstepTrader @weis_brian is this something y’all have thought about doing before?
2640,2020-08-27 23:21:48+00:00,TradesByMatt,Or like 3 minis if we want to see some crazy crazy. Although I think 1 mini would offer the most respect for the winner
2641,2020-08-27 23:20:48+00:00,TradesByMatt,"I think a comp for futures where you are limited to (sim) 1 mini, $$x,xxx drawdown from the starting balance, 1 month to moon it, winner takes all would be so fun and fun to watch. Not sure if it’s legal to do etc. but if it’s legal, I’m up to work with someone on this"
2642,2020-08-27 22:50:58+00:00,TradesByMatt,@0x141e That CME one is interesting. I’ll have to take a look next time it’s open
2643,2020-08-27 22:43:52+00:00,TradesByMatt,Are trading comps a thing only in crypto or in normal futures/equities as well?
2644,2020-08-27 17:56:08+00:00,TradesByMatt,@ChartTrader360 Lmao

The monthly $9 fee, is their data on returns right now / -Is there a ideal deposit value (dip my toes in the water to see how it works) for testing?"

2689,2020-08-20 22:50:36+00:00,TradesByMatt,"The market changes, traders change. If you or someone criticizes something you did months ago, shake it off because you are likely to be trading a variation based on the new market conditions. Change is healthy. Continuous development is a must."

2740,2020-08-10 15:33:18+00:00,TradesByMatt,"$1,026 PROFIT this morning. Great start to the week and good energy all around. https://t.co/KzsSHP0fJ3"

2749,2020-08-06 16:26:14+00:00,TradesByMatt,@marcoplc Yes:)
2750,2020-08-06 15:05:55+00:00,TradesByMatt,Great fun day on stream. Shorted the very top of the MNQ. Bagged $139 and am now done with Step 1 of the 150K Topstep account. Step 2 Starts tomorrow!
2751,2020-08-05 19:37:00+00:00,TradesByMatt,@Alexxeon There are almost always trade opportunities out there. Just have to be patient for them
2752,2020-08-05 16:05:47+00:00,TradesByMatt,@sovier Super
2753,2020-08-05 15:55:24+00:00,TradesByMatt,Bring back #volatility2020
2754,2020-08-05 15:04:45+00:00,TradesByMatt,Thanks for tuning in! Only took 2 micro trades for $308 profit and both were winners. Easy day and on to the next!
2755,2020-08-05 12:41:24+00:00,TradesByMatt,Trading live at market open. Will be looking at currency futures as well today on TSTrader. Put a reminder on and come hangout! https://t.co/Oq9GNhoWT3
2756,2020-08-05 02:29:37+00:00,TradesByMatt,@sovier That’s my entire point. You get wayyyy more attempts to earn money and get better at trading than you do just burning through your own 3K. You get 3K per reset on the topstep account.
2757,2020-08-05 01:16:10+00:00,TradesByMatt,@EdwinCk2 $100. All info can be found through my pinned tweet
2758,2020-08-05 00:18:24+00:00,TradesByMatt,@ProlongWealth @RealBrianWatt I stream 30. I doubly for trading 60 is needed. I’ll let you know how it turns out
2759,2020-08-05 00:17:56+00:00,TradesByMatt,@Bayside_Zach Extrapolate it out then. Say you use 5 months and 10 resets. Still better than losing your own 3000 which would still be inevitable if you are having to reset do to hiring loss limits
2760,2020-08-05 00:16:34+00:00,TradesByMatt,@Bayside_Zach if you have made profit and break a rule you can email and ask to be sent back to Step 2 instead of step 1
2761,2020-08-05 00:15:48+00:00,TradesByMatt,@sovier Hypothetical to show how incredibly much you could lose and still be better off than losing 3000 of you own money
2762,2020-08-04 22:29:00+00:00,TradesByMatt,All parts ordered for my new Trading/streaming computer. We went big and did it right. Will make a video on building and how it is in case you are in the market or interested in your own.

2812,2020-07-28 23:08:33+00:00,TradesByMatt,@DamonTanksley Wanted to try something new for myself and they had a few features I was curious in. But I can’t use them so back to TSTrader
2813,2020-07-28 20:49:50+00:00,TradesByMatt,Day 1 Step 1 recap...basically a scratch day learning some forex trading https://t.co/UEXTG9AN02
2814,2020-07-28 20:28:32+00:00,TradesByMatt,"If you already have a funded account through Sierra you will be ok, is what I was told. Since I don’t, I have to find a new option"
2815,2020-07-28 20:28:03+00:00,TradesByMatt,"@Dusty_119 Sierra is ditching Rithmic. Not Topsteps fault, Sierra is just moving on I guess"
2816,2020-07-28 20:07:12+00:00,TradesByMatt,"Received word from topstep they will be cutting ties with Sierra in the next week or so...bummer. Scratch the previous idea...onto something new, or maybe back to TSTrader"
2817,2020-07-28 16:37:00+00:00,TradesByMatt,"@JonBonTrader While I am complaining, it's nice to have low effort trading with fairly low risk on the table. not scalping for seconds is a healthy change up haha"
2818,2020-07-28 16:28:23+00:00,TradesByMatt,@CryptoGainz1 Posting huge losses is such a soft flex that I’m all about. “Kids I lose more than your net worth in a day and I am still able to trade on”
2819,2020-07-28 16:27:06+00:00,TradesByMatt,Going from exclusively trading  $NQ_F to a forex pair is almost comical from a time and money perspective. Forex is slow after trading minis lol
2820,2020-07-28 15:47:19+00:00,TradesByMatt,@covertsaj @Unforeseen I will ask Topstep if they are aware and what their contingency is
2821,2020-07-28 15:46:09+00:00,TradesByMatt,"@PAdirectives been there, done that. Apart form Tradovate, Sierra is the only other platform I see for the combine that has features I want to try out that no one else offers"
2822,2020-07-28 15:43:34+00:00,TradesByMatt,@covertsaj @Unforeseen I will be using it with Topstep per their recommendations here...assuming I go through with using it. But it is interesting to me for sure and I would like to do it https://t.co/HjtGOJuhuE
2823,2020-07-28 15:34:02+00:00,TradesByMatt,"Thinking I’m going to give Sierra Chart a try during this next combine I will be doing on stream. Everything on stream this far has been Tradovate/TSTrader so will be interesting to see comparisons etc. Never used Sierra before so if you have helpful tips and tricks, lmk"
2824,2020-07-28 12:29:54+00:00,TradesByMatt,"Streams this week: I have 9amCT meetings today, tomorrow, and Thursday. I will try and get live after them but it’s a toss up. We WILL be live Thursday for $AAPL $AMZN $GOOGL earnings in the afternoon and Live Friday morning as usual!"

2981,2020-07-05 21:39:14+00:00,TradesByMatt,🔴 REMINDER: Streaming my trading LIVE Monday-Friday this week starting at 8:20CT! 🔴
2982,2020-07-05 19:16:36+00:00,TradesByMatt,"@nickel285 Thanks, will highlight those tomorrow on stream"
2983,2020-07-03 16:34:02+00:00,TradesByMatt,@andrelondonuk @PAdirectives @vijayreddy83 You are close minded so I’m out on this convo lol. Everyone talking in circles and a waste of time. Good luck in your trading everyone (for whoever actually is a genuine trader)
2984,2020-07-03 15:47:06+00:00,TradesByMatt,@andrelondonuk @PAdirectives @vijayreddy83 All I’m doing is saying your kind of full of it lol. You come out yelling scam and I am just saying you’re wrong as well as trying to understand why you think. But you seem to not really have thoughts on it and just saying it for shits and gigs
2985,2020-07-03 14:49:17+00:00,TradesByMatt,@andrelondonuk @PAdirectives @vijayreddy83 Also harder as you go on? Not sure what that means either. You’re eluding to not being able to pass the combine I guess? Maybe use less contracts and try harder. Not a scam just cause you can’t pass lol
2986,2020-07-02 22:16:05+00:00,TradesByMatt,@andrelondonuk @vijayreddy83 Lol
2987,2020-07-02 21:45:30+00:00,TradesByMatt,"@andrelondonuk @vijayreddy83 Curious why you feel they are a scam? Not good enough to get funded and pass the combine? Never missed a payment withdraw from them, customer support is above and beyond, and they don’t hide behind anonymity. Entitled to your own thoughts, just thought I’d share mine"
2988,2020-07-02 21:16:45+00:00,TradesByMatt,Let me know if you enjoyed the podcast. Makes me want to go do some more so let me know which ones are your favorite!

2994,2020-07-02 13:44:42+00:00,TradesByMatt,Come hangout! Last stream of the week so you know it's green
2995,2020-07-02 13:20:59+00:00,TradesByMatt,I am live streaming my Futures trading session. Watch on YOUTUBE here: https://t.co/HaMZIMWexB or on TWITCH here: https://t.co/dIRFYSN7PZ
2996,2020-07-02 12:22:16+00:00,TradesByMatt,"@JamaCapital Flip side of that, no one really has videos of passing combines consistently either"
2997,2020-07-01 21:41:02+00:00,TradesByMatt,Reminder! My appearance in the Topstep podcast debuts tomorrow at 3PM Central! I will post a link when live. https://t.co/6O7zcTLfMP
2998,2020-07-01 20:45:12+00:00,TradesByMatt,"completing combines = showing you how to pass all of the combines on Topstep
trading funded acc = trading my 150K as normal"
2999,2020-07-01 20:44:41+00:00,TradesByMatt,Which of the following are you more interested in watching on the live stream every morning?
3000,2020-07-01 19:47:40+00:00,TradesByMatt,"If you were interested in the 25% Topstep, it expires tomorrow...not sure if at midnight tonight. So today is your last day! If interested in 25% off combine: Go here and when you select your account size, enter “classic25” https://t.co/29Ed4It3iP"
3001,2020-07-01 13:53:21+00:00,TradesByMatt,@vrbo Just sent DM
3002,2020-07-01 13:24:31+00:00,TradesByMatt,"@nvtrader123 Yes, the weekend will be nice! Unfortunately I have much more work than when I stream so hardly the day off...one day though lol"
3003,2020-07-01 03:06:04+00:00,TradesByMatt,"@livingrightco @vrbo Agreed, not that hard to just credit the account. Keep my money, but let me book at a time where I’m not risking a life. But maybe it is, if so, they should work on it."
3004,2020-07-01 03:04:31+00:00,TradesByMatt,@AllEyezOnCBs This is good to know...not sure how it works but worth a shot.
3005,2020-07-01 03:03:53+00:00,TradesByMatt,"@StudentofMarke2 Pretty shady, showing their true colors through all of this, that’s for sure. @vrbo"
3006,2020-07-01 02:53:51+00:00,TradesByMatt,"A refund would be ideal since there is no way we will be putting her at risk, but even if you can’t do that, why are you not offering credit for the next year out or something? You are showing no empathy or lack of caring as cases are back on the rise. Pretty sad."
3007,2020-07-01 02:52:33+00:00,TradesByMatt,@vrbo had a birthday trip scheduled and now one of the guests is pregnant putting them at high risk of covid. Owner won’t let us cancel because trip is at the end of July. Cases are skyrocketing here in Texas. Completely unsafe and ridiculous. (1/2)
3008,2020-06-30 20:18:01+00:00,TradesByMatt,@DucksterMeister Yeah that is one option. You can also just trade micros like you were saying. Just depends on how long you want to take and how much risk you want to put out. Lots of trading options available!
3009,2020-06-30 20:00:13+00:00,TradesByMatt,@DucksterMeister yeah I trade micros and scalp it
3010,2020-06-30 19:59:50+00:00,TradesByMatt,"@TicTocTick yeah join up, no commitment, just 1800 people trying to help each other out and make money. If you bring positivity and something to the table then its a win for everyone. https://t.co/Vpe1JFWTpd"
3011,2020-06-30 19:59:20+00:00,TradesByMatt,"@iammoezart yeah join up, no commitment cause everything is free, just 1800 people trying to help each other out and make money https://t.co/Vpe1JFWTpd"
3012,2020-06-30 19:05:51+00:00,TradesByMatt,@trainhard49 Premium tomorrow! Passed the Pro Account on stream a couple weeks ago. I do recommend going Pro first and then premium!
3013,2020-06-30 18:16:40+00:00,TradesByMatt,Update: Stream tomorrow morning will be starting around 9:30 (so 1 hour later than normal). I had a meeting come up during our normal time. See you then!
3014,2020-06-30 18:10:31+00:00,TradesByMatt,@TDP_Academy one thing to note: 25% off offer expires Thursday. After that I am back to only giving my 20% off discount
3015,2020-06-30 18:09:55+00:00,TradesByMatt,@TDP_Academy Cheers!
3016,2020-06-30 17:59:20+00:00,TradesByMatt,@TDP_Academy Above link is for a shot at a free month. This is just the account page and use same code: https://t.co/29Ed4It3iP
3017,2020-06-30 17:57:26+00:00,TradesByMatt,"@TDP_Academy Well I can fix that problem for you.
If interested in 25% off combine: Go here and when you select your account size, enter “classic25” at checkout code for the full discount https://t.co/hVAn5t1nKl"
3018,2020-06-30 17:56:38+00:00,TradesByMatt,"@TDP_Academy Better yet though...best to just trade a few contracts and use the drawdown. However you look at it, win win. $2700 saved if you blow account, or you turn $300 into XXX,XXX if you’re decent"
3019,2020-06-30 17:55:31+00:00,TradesByMatt,"@TDP_Academy Well of course haha...15 lots you would need to scale in. No one would be willing to give you money to market 15 lots in over and over again, most likely not sustainable and terrible risk management for a business haha. You pay $300 get access to 3K drawdown and scale in 15 lots"
3020,2020-06-30 17:38:14+00:00,TradesByMatt,@TDP_Academy Believe they call it 150K due to you are allowed overnight(Globex) trading on 15 contracts = super high margin requirements.
3021,2020-06-30 17:22:44+00:00,TradesByMatt,"If interested in 25% off combine: Go here and when you select your account size, enter “classic25” at checkout code for the full discount https://t.co/hVAn5t1nKl"
3022,2020-06-30 17:22:38+00:00,TradesByMatt,"Tomorrow I start trading my Premium funded 150K Topstep account. If you want to follow along or are curious about Topstep, there are 2 more days to get 25% off! Get it while it's hot, although I can always get you 20% off. Couple more days of 25% off topstep."

3032,2020-06-27 23:28:03+00:00,TradesByMatt,@1greencandle @TraderRJPM Thank you!
3033,2020-06-27 22:30:54+00:00,TradesByMatt,@TraderRJPM Thanks! My targets and trade invalidations come with market structure and the way the buyers/sellers are moving with or against me. So basically every trade is different!
3034,2020-06-27 18:06:06+00:00,TradesByMatt,@1greencandle Couldn’t agree more with this
3035,2020-06-27 13:31:48+00:00,TradesByMatt,@TraderRJPM @1greencandle Have tons of information on my YouTube and their website about it. Feel free to browse

3076,2020-06-23 20:54:05+00:00,TradesByMatt,@TDP_Academy If it’s a legal Q at 5K it’s also legal at $5. Both are annoying. People just see a number larger than $50 and lose their minds

3272,2020-06-05 01:44:55+00:00,TradesByMatt,@RealBrianWatt It’s all a bit confusing until you go through it a few times honestly

3339,2020-05-27 12:22:13+00:00,TradesByMatt,@BlackFlagMarine @TheRealJayPelle Yep. I also feel there are some people legitimately trying to pay it forward/have good karma and help people out who are starting out or need a boost. I believe you can tell these from the other types easily who are just out to make a quick buck
3340,2020-05-27 12:16:34+00:00,TradesByMatt,@BlackFlagMarine @TheRealJayPelle Yeah exactly. Lots of goons out there. Find someone who trades live or chats live and forget the rest imo. Have a handful of people I watch and everyone else is meh to me for that reason
3341,2020-05-27 12:02:56+00:00,TradesByMatt,"@TheRealJayPelle If youre paying for a service and they are hiding a 9-5, bad. If you don’t pay, they are out in the open and have decent reasoning who cares. I still work 9-5 cause I like my job and am able to do both it and trade. Once I can’t trade anymore I’ll leave but till then I like both"
3342,2020-05-27 01:33:04+00:00,TradesByMatt,@JPLokey Thanks for the feedback and tuning in so often!
3343,2020-05-27 01:32:35+00:00,TradesByMatt,"@RealBrianWatt What platform, what chart, how much money do you have, at are margins, what symbols. Never ends! Lol"
3344,2020-05-27 01:18:48+00:00,TradesByMatt,@RealBrianWatt Unfortunately it doesn’t get better on YouTube lol. Appreciate you!
3345,2020-05-26 22:14:41+00:00,TradesByMatt,Just got news I will be working remote till at least September 1st. Streams are staying around for a good long while! Good news!
3346,2020-05-26 20:05:22+00:00,TradesByMatt,"Is there any way you feel the stream could be more fun, entertaining, or helpful?  I want to create the best day trading stream possible! Let me know!⬇️"

3354,2020-05-22 11:53:58+00:00,TradesByMatt,REMINDER: NO stream today or Monday due to Memorial Day. I’m vacationing:) have a great long weekend and see you Tuesday at market open!
3355,2020-05-22 01:09:04+00:00,TradesByMatt,It can be pretty easy to get “desk locked” when trading. Do push-ups on the hour and get a water pacer to help combat the slug you will become from being desk locked
3356,2020-05-21 21:48:57+00:00,TradesByMatt,@FX_ENTROPY 💰
3357,2020-05-21 17:52:09+00:00,TradesByMatt,👀 @trader1sz thanks for the follow. Trying not to puff my chest right now. Been following you for years
3358,2020-05-21 15:50:17+00:00,TradesByMatt,happy thursday/start of long weekend everyone!
3359,2020-05-21 15:49:14+00:00,TradesByMatt,Thanks for tuning in to the live trading stream this morning! We bagged $621 on the day and kept it much more under control than yesterday lol. Next stream will be Tuesday morning at market open so make sure you come stop by! $NQ_F $ES_F #micros
3360,2020-05-21 01:38:54+00:00,TradesByMatt,@RealBrianWatt @MykeSmith Thanks for the shoutouts Brian. A lot of my trading style I owe to watching you over the years!
3361,2020-05-20 14:24:17+00:00,TradesByMatt,Had to start a second stream on the morning due to internet dying. Sad.
3362,2020-05-20 12:32:23+00:00,TradesByMatt,🔴Live Futures Day Trading - Come hangout on stream with me at https://t.co/7MHzZs2naX $NQ_F $ES_F #daytrading #stockmarket
3363,2020-05-20 12:07:41+00:00,TradesByMatt,Hopping on stream in 25min. Getting an early start cause will need to leave again early like yesterday. Tomorrow stream resumes to normal
3364,2020-05-20 12:02:02+00:00,TradesByMatt,🎯 🎯 🎯 read this and get motivated! Going live in 30 min! (Written by member of free chat) https://t.co/jSwg3iXEku
3365,2020-05-19 22:47:59+00:00,TradesByMatt,@AnimeDayTrader It will stay that way but you learn to have better suspension as time goes on haha. You got it!
3366,2020-05-19 22:44:55+00:00,TradesByMatt,@AnimeDayTrader Wow! Awesome. Make some money and be risk conscious. Then open your own account and bag all the gains! Good luck!!
3367,2020-05-19 22:39:18+00:00,TradesByMatt,My goal in doing these is to show how accessible a trading account is for everyone and how you can go from a small few hundred dollar investment with Topstep and turn it into thousands almost risk free. Truly game changing in my opinion
3368,2020-05-19 22:38:08+00:00,TradesByMatt,Started a 150K Topstep combine with the goal of streaming the journey and funded account. Well I was short heavy NQ at 407 when it dumped. Passed step 1 on the first day and now just waiting for minimum days. Will start streaming the account for step 2 and on since step 1 is done
3369,2020-05-19 22:17:32+00:00,TradesByMatt,@RealBrianWatt @MykeSmith @OnlyFutures Likewise!
3370,2020-05-19 22:13:44+00:00,TradesByMatt,"@RealBrianWatt @small_exchange Need to look into this, thanks for sharing. Haven’t heard of it before."
3371,2020-05-19 21:57:03+00:00,TradesByMatt,@RealBrianWatt @MykeSmith @OnlyFutures I actually have never paid for it. As I have been redoing my YouTube stream the past several days I have thought about. But currently don’t use it. Maybe tomorrow I will look more into it
3372,2020-05-19 21:44:30+00:00,TradesByMatt,@MykeSmith @RealBrianWatt @OnlyFutures Essentially streamlabs is what all big name users use. It is the go to platform for streamers so they cover their basics very very well
3373,2020-05-19 21:41:08+00:00,TradesByMatt,"@MykeSmith @RealBrianWatt @OnlyFutures Yeah you can go into each one separately (hosted dashboard) or you can view comments live in the streamlabs application or dashboard. If you go the multi stream route like restream, they also have a chat in their app that consolidates each platform chat. Nice and helpful"
3374,2020-05-19 21:38:30+00:00,TradesByMatt,@RealBrianWatt @MykeSmith @OnlyFutures That is correct. You can even go super crazy and use something like https://t.co/8465tAPKll to stream to all of those platforms at once if you want 🤯
3375,2020-05-19 21:34:47+00:00,TradesByMatt,@RealBrianWatt @MykeSmith @OnlyFutures No problem! Sharing the knowledge hopefully. Picked live streaming back up a few weeks ago and got a dedicated computer for it running streamlabs myself. So using streamlabs OBS every morning right now. We should somehow get a 3 way stream going soon! Might be fun
3376,2020-05-19 21:30:00+00:00,TradesByMatt,"@MykeSmith @OnlyFutures Nice, yeah worth it imo. Just adds some “fun” elements to the stream natively that you kind of have to work for with OBS normal. Cheers!"
3377,2020-05-19 20:50:21+00:00,TradesByMatt,"@MykeSmith @OnlyFutures One note which is completely unsolicited lol. Might use streamlabs obs if you keep up with the live-streams. Little more made for it than normal OBS. If that’s what you’re using already, disregard lol."
3378,2020-05-19 15:19:46+00:00,TradesByMatt,rotational days off yesterday volume profile it seems $ES_F Glad I took my money and ran!
3379,2020-05-19 13:57:03+00:00,TradesByMatt,super short stream today but we Bagged $550. Thanks for tuning in and see you tomorrow for some live trading! $NQ_F

3383,2020-05-18 20:42:07+00:00,TradesByMatt,@MykeSmith Thanks! Have a lot of room for growth and studying I need to do to figure out appropriate lot sizes due to dollar moves per contract varying on each asset. Any ideas there are always appreciated! Will also let you know what I find in the coming weeks
3384,2020-05-18 20:24:49+00:00,TradesByMatt,"@MykeSmith Same, I typically hedge out to other index but havent messed around with micro/mini hedges. But yes same, really need to get better at it and when to actually start the hedging process...part of the game to learn and study up on for myself"
3385,2020-05-18 20:19:22+00:00,TradesByMatt,@MykeSmith I wish. I was short ES all day (starting 9:30CT lol) but did grab a NQ hedge late day. Wasn’t very fun but ended green so meh.
3386,2020-05-18 20:14:55+00:00,TradesByMatt,"@MykeSmith Feel that, my day was very similar today"

3471,2020-04-27 12:47:11+00:00,TradesByMatt,Why trade the $ES_F or $MES_F? Liquidity liquidity liquidity. Ability to build size and exit.

Until $GILD failed and brought us loads of money. Such a good day and highlight of trading career for fun and money. $MES_F only #4kday https://t.co/A8Heo8vfqF

3490,2020-04-22 12:39:30+00:00,TradesByMatt,@FX_ENTROPY @BryceNelson 20 max or standard 2 is my absolute position size... I find i am often more right on general move than on specific entry
3491,2020-04-22 11:57:54+00:00,TradesByMatt,@FX_ENTROPY Normal account is played with “true risk management” also because it’s scalping minis but with less volatility. With volatility high I keep stops wide (plus make burner account so trying to go big). Personally believe this is best way to take advantage of current conditions

3847,2019-05-03 01:06:06+00:00,TradesByMatt,@CryptoDonAlt Just responded to @AskMeHowToShort thread on this. TLDR: completely agree. Looking for 5870 as an average. Fills above and below are placed.
3848,2019-05-03 00:59:02+00:00,TradesByMatt,I don’t even use a scanner. I just rotate through my favorite trading stocks. Check the setups right before the bell and pick one. Easy peazy
3849,2019-05-03 00:55:02+00:00,TradesByMatt,$PINS $LYFT $SQ on my stocks watchlist tomorrow. pins has been real good to me this week. Keep it up bae
3850,2019-05-03 00:45:01+00:00,TradesByMatt,"@VolatilityQ @HavanaNights_ @kamiari_ Good shit brotha. What’s your background in? Having to teach myself all of it right now, but about 4 projects in and the addiction is only growing."
3851,2019-05-03 00:14:08+00:00,TradesByMatt,"New content will be on NinjaTrader basics, futures basics, maybe some crypto shit. Who knows. Either way it will all me on my YouTube. Same name as here"
3852,2019-05-03 00:13:31+00:00,TradesByMatt,Need to get back on the YouTube game. YouTube is a wave pattern for me lol
3853,2019-05-03 00:05:57+00:00,TradesByMatt,@AskMeHowToShort People ask me why I chart finex. It’s really just to make sure I’m always keeping an eye on the correlation. Things like right now are very telling...at least they have been historically
3854,2019-05-02 18:47:25+00:00,TradesByMatt,3 short days but LOTS of money #futures #charting #trading $NQ https://t.co/SmXg1loZVP
3855,2019-05-02 14:04:42+00:00,TradesByMatt,@mbaro1989 Got to much hate for trying to stream. Wasn’t worth my time ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
3856,2019-05-02 13:44:14+00:00,TradesByMatt,If you don’t trade #futures just go to @NinjaTrader and open yourself up an account. Go get that money. I will personally help you kick start your journey. Just reach out
3857,2019-05-02 13:43:12+00:00,TradesByMatt,There are big things in store. I want to bring trading to the masses
3858,2019-05-02 11:55:49+00:00,TradesByMatt,The flip side is also true...continuing today when you are up nicely will most likely result in you giving back some if not all the gains
3859,2019-05-02 11:54:18+00:00,TradesByMatt,Trading is about knowing when to STOP. Continuing to trade when you are losing will put you in a far greater hole than just stopping. 💯
3860,2019-05-02 11:53:18+00:00,TradesByMatt,Day trading and entrepreneurship go hand in hand
3861,2019-05-02 00:49:30+00:00,TradesByMatt,You learn more trading futures for 6 months then you will about PA in any other sector. Crypto back in the day would be a contender

3867,2019-04-30 18:53:04+00:00,TradesByMatt,When I made 5 trades the past 2 days I was up ~800. Then I started over trading and gave it all back. Must learn to walk away and not over trade.
3868,2019-04-30 18:51:53+00:00,TradesByMatt,"When you think you have your rules established in your head, wait a week and try and push them in even deeper"
3869,2019-04-30 18:51:29+00:00,TradesByMatt,"Haven’t struggled with overtrading the past month until today. Was up so nice 30 minutes in, saw a setup I thought I wanted but then ended up giving back my gains for the week and losing some. Broke too many rules. FOMC tomorrow, most likely won’t trade"
3870,2019-04-29 18:01:58+00:00,TradesByMatt,"@ThinkingUSD Had a order at 5870, now I have to move cause everyone is going front run you which also means front running me lol -_-"

3879,2019-04-26 18:12:35+00:00,TradesByMatt,"@ta_mule @aTeam_eduard Short the daily resistance while everyone plays a meme. *sigh, poor traders*"

3881,2019-04-26 12:02:14+00:00,TradesByMatt,"Do you want to know the secret sauce? Here it is: When the price is going up and everyone is bullish, short the resistance, same thing on the way down. It’s simple. People just get too focused in on the move and forget that the end goal is to fuck people and take their money"

3901,2019-04-17 19:28:51+00:00,TradesByMatt,@DavidTreen3 @brittrades1 MUCH easier!
3902,2019-04-17 16:43:06+00:00,TradesByMatt,@brittrades1 It’s still just price action. Use an ECN broker or pay commissions if you don’t like spreads. Trade major pairs for volume. Forex seems straight forward and easy so far
3903,2019-04-17 02:18:12+00:00,TradesByMatt,"For you #Forex traders out there, what times of day are you typically scalping? Do you scalp or swing it? I’m having some good success scalping day 1."

4198,2019-01-22 16:26:21+00:00,TradesByMatt,"$NQ_F Wicks like this all day mean a couple things: 1. There is some major uncertainty about where price should be going 2. Shakeouts are happening for a larger scale move 3. Only trade if you are a microscalper 

Overall holdng the downtrend rn https://t.co/CepV3xufvV"
4199,2019-01-22 16:12:58+00:00,TradesByMatt,"$NQ_F Do you prefer to try and time a bottom or play the chop? Good Traders can do both, but in a world of commissions, one typically wins"

4203,2019-01-22 13:16:58+00:00,TradesByMatt,"Good morning everyone. Get your mind right and your body ready for the market open. It’s going to be a good week, prep for it. Personally, I’ll be trading #futures $NQ in the morning and $crypto $BTC in the afternoon. This plan helps with overtrading on either market. #timetoeat"
4204,2019-01-22 00:58:47+00:00,TradesByMatt,@SalsaTekila Yeah I get that. For me personally I just don’t have the time for all of them. I would rather just stare at BTC and know it by heart
4205,2019-01-22 00:32:28+00:00,TradesByMatt,"@SalsaTekila Master of 1, no need to be “fine” at the others. You get paid"

4209,2019-01-21 22:30:18+00:00,TradesByMatt,"Spent the day mountain biking on my new @santacruzbikes #5010c and it was exactly what I needed going into this week. Trading is a tough mental activity, it’s important to take care of yourself and relax. Your profits will thank you for doing this #crypto #trading $BTC $NQ"

4213,2019-01-20 20:00:49+00:00,TradesByMatt,@crypto_dizrupt Thanks brotha! All about keeping it simple!
4214,2019-01-20 19:59:37+00:00,TradesByMatt,I would love to see some #analysis on the percentage of #daytraders who go from being positive on the day to negative on the day from the sole purpose of overtrading. This issue isn’t talked about enough and should really be addressed if we want to see others become profitable
4215,2019-01-20 19:49:42+00:00,TradesByMatt,"Number 1 rule of trading= know how to lose. 
Number 2 rule of trading= know when you’re ahead on the day and go celebrate. That’s what it’s all about, treat yourself. 
#DayTrading #crypto $BTC"
4216,2019-01-20 19:48:25+00:00,TradesByMatt,"I want to help start the movement in #crypto traders to make educated, high probability trades, that are formed under a basis of humility in order to cut losers but also let your winners ride. You beat the market by NOT blowing up your account off a losing trade $BTC #futures"
4217,2019-01-20 19:45:39+00:00,TradesByMatt,"No trader has a 100% win rate. Good ones have 80-90%, but even then they know how to lose. Trading is about knowing how to lose and coming back stronger. It’s so much more than just “risk reward”"
4218,2019-01-20 19:44:20+00:00,TradesByMatt,Trading is about letting you winners ride and cutting your losers as fast as you can. Better setups will always happen. No reason to hold an underwater position when you can take the L and get back in on a higher probability setup
4219,2019-01-20 19:43:30+00:00,TradesByMatt,"Good trading is about finding the highest probability scenario and executing it. Great trading is doing the prior, but also understanding you are no God and to GTFO if it’s moving against you."

4221,2019-01-20 13:20:54+00:00,TradesByMatt,*Bullish meaning short term continuation
4222,2019-01-20 12:58:09+00:00,TradesByMatt,"Update: as said earlier, selloff at that level was NOT bullish https://t.co/oxmJyz7tjH"
4223,2019-01-19 19:00:15+00:00,TradesByMatt,This is a traditional #crypto swing trade
4224,2019-01-19 18:41:15+00:00,TradesByMatt,"XLM/BTC: Fibs origins are circled. We are at a key support. The play imo would be a long off support at 2878 with a stop at 2830 and then Take profit levels marked. If stopped out, look for reentry on the lower green levels https://t.co/dljE53NSAs"
4225,2019-01-19 18:26:43+00:00,TradesByMatt,Here is my personal view on Zil/BTC shown with daily fibs as well as daily levels and then broken down into the 4hr view. A clean break of the top green box and we could start testing the fibs on the daily. $ZILBTC #bitcoin #crypto #altcoins https://t.co/Z3l0YAxC0M

4227,2019-01-19 13:57:39+00:00,TradesByMatt,The bullish case would be a close above the level to show the buying strength. This would put a new test into the 4K range. $BTC #bitcoin
4228,2019-01-19 13:47:18+00:00,TradesByMatt,"#bitcoin $BTC wicked up right to that previous daily level. The level that brought us to the pump into 4K as well as the drop down to 3600. The sell off at that level is not bullish, but we just have to wait and see how the candle closes. #crypto https://t.co/urEMpNmOdx"
4229,2019-01-19 02:01:15+00:00,TradesByMatt,"Speaking of fibs, here is the #bitcoin $BTC chart showing the major support we are sitting on as well as major fib levels off the recent down and up moves. Technical levels formed for you https://t.co/rRRmiHtmdB"

4231,2019-01-19 01:02:25+00:00,TradesByMatt,Today the $NQ closed above 6800 which brought us to the end of a very bullish week.
