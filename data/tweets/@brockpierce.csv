1068,2021-11-17 01:40:19+00:00,brockpierce,@tequilaeos @RUDEMUDCRAB Reducing our dependency on B1 was necessary to make EOS stronger. Many of their shortcomings were due to regulatory issues not a lack of interest.

1070,2021-11-17 01:33:08+00:00,brockpierce,@RUDEMUDCRAB Bullish has the potential to make EOS the settlement layer for BTC and USDT. If that becomes even partially true it‚Äôll be huge.

1074,2021-11-17 01:18:01+00:00,brockpierce,@simoncase78 Agreed on open communication. When the network takes tokens from anyone it puts trust in the system at risk. The only exceptions in the sector so far have been from major hacks not just because the network is unhappy.
1075,2021-11-17 01:17:08+00:00,brockpierce,@RUDEMUDCRAB The stake was an agreement made from the beginning. How do we objectively measure and adjudicate disputes like this while creating confidence for billions or trillions of dollars to transact on EOS mainnet?

4251,2019-02-12 01:45:25+00:00,brockpierce,@MagicalTux @brucefenton @mdudas That can probably be avoided if you donate your 88% to a Foundation created for the benefit of creditors. I will waive any claim if you do this.
