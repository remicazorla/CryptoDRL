123,2023-02-10 03:47:26+00:00,tarunchitra,@jon_charb Missing some notion of the fact that fees now are worth more than issuance now when you’re smaller and this flips later on in your lifetime (e.g. discount rate is a time dependent function of size/market cap/etc.)

149,2023-02-06 17:03:01+00:00,tarunchitra,@nikete @ObadiaAlex @sxysun1 I guess the real question I'd pose is whether it was a two way dialogue between two fields; if its simply one field using results from another to improve their field it is quite different than the back and forth of Langlands (which made huge strides to all fields involved)

268,2023-01-27 23:52:21+00:00,tarunchitra,@delitzer @_weidai Another way of thinking about it is that it lets you keep the time delay separate from the implementation of approve as a standalone function — but I agree its a lot easier technically if people cohered on a standard for expiry (hence the galaxy brain disclaimer 😅)
269,2023-01-27 23:50:15+00:00,tarunchitra,@delitzer @_weidai The ZKP side has one benefit of not needing to be a particular implementation / standardization — as long as I can verify a proof that TimeWrappedERC20::approve or permit2::approve worked I can accept it (versus coherence on a particular implementation)
270,2023-01-27 23:43:09+00:00,tarunchitra,@delitzer @_weidai I will when I see enough support for it and if people coalesce on it as a standard
271,2023-01-27 23:32:50+00:00,tarunchitra,@ericjuta @0xRacerAlt Yeah but people don’t standardize those (with the proof you don’t need to standardize how it’s used and have receiving users understand how to parse the data structure)

476,2023-01-02 08:09:01+00:00,tarunchitra,@llllvvuu @toghrulmaharram @aeyakovenko Arguably there’s probably some work to be done on multiple time scale fork choice rules; the proof that GHOST / Snowman achieve probabilistic liveness work assume a single time scale point process whose mean is equal to the block arrival time generating new blocks

870,2022-11-19 19:02:39+00:00,tarunchitra,"@0xhopf @0xfoobar @nikete @mjlorig Also, figuring out how to measure the cost of keeping spot-perps tight vs. the max latency they deviate more than x bps would make it a lot easier to compare these designs"
871,2022-11-19 19:01:57+00:00,tarunchitra,"@0xhopf @0xfoobar @nikete @mjlorig I guess that's fair, although they still clamp to 0.05% arbitrarily — which sort of nullifies the ""average funding rate of the interval""

But this is why a DeFi version of this (with code you can read, reason about, and stress test) would be superior"
872,2022-11-19 18:29:33+00:00,tarunchitra,"@0xfoobar @nikete @mjlorig I think the cap is an artifact of making the ""interest rate spread between the assets"" a constant — if it was floating (e.g. using a DeFi lender's pricing), you shouldn't need to do the clipping or capping"
873,2022-11-19 18:26:58+00:00,tarunchitra,"@0xfoobar @nikete @mjlorig For instance: why is there no momentum term in the calculation of the spread? Why is it strictly perp price - spot price at a fixed time? Intuitively, the proportional mechanism is more or less doing gradient descent on (perp price - spot price) — and we know Nesterov &gt; stock GD"
874,2022-11-19 18:25:49+00:00,tarunchitra,@0xfoobar @nikete @mjlorig e.g. you get Binance-level tight spreads but require a huge amount of OI there to keep the assets synchronized — but what if you had a more capital efficient mechanism? It likely wouldn't be a proportional controller like most perps today
875,2022-11-19 18:24:55+00:00,tarunchitra,"@0xfoobar @nikete @mjlorig Yeah, there's sort of a 'cost vs. latency' trade-off (latency of spread between perp and spot vs. cost of liquidity / arbitrage to keep the perp and spot prices in line) — this has never been written down formally"
876,2022-11-19 18:21:53+00:00,tarunchitra,There was a project from @bryanhpchiang that evinced the MPC aspects of perps — but I think you need to combine that with an understanding of how to price the funding rate as a standalone security to improve current mechanisms — current env is good for this exploration
877,2022-11-19 18:21:52+00:00,tarunchitra,"Somehow, taking the dialectic (or really, 'multi-lectic') view of perps as simultaneously a control mechanism, an adversarial oracle, and a form of leverage probably will lead you to better mechanisms than the current ones (and will be much easier to implement credibly in DeFi)"
878,2022-11-19 18:21:52+00:00,tarunchitra,"View perps as a model-predictive-controller → the current mechanism is a low frequency proportional controller

View the funding rate as a security → pricing should have some dependence on the IR spread between the assets in the perp (but CEXs make it .. constant?!)"
879,2022-11-19 18:21:52+00:00,tarunchitra,Feeling a little inspired about perp mechanism design after talking with @nikete and @mjlorig today — the amount of copy-pasta mechanism design (e.g. everyone does 8h funding payments because... Bitmex did it and it worked?) that could be improved is pretty massive
880,2022-11-19 18:09:21+00:00,tarunchitra,"@Adi_Dommaraju @alexhevans @GuilleAngeris haha, I was told something similar (e.g. people replicate barriers but not forwards)"
881,2022-11-19 18:07:04+00:00,tarunchitra,@Adi_Dommaraju @alexhevans @GuilleAngeris I think you could extend this model to something w/ bounded liquidity and then show properties about how the payoff improves (somewhat similarly to how we compared order books and CFMMs when you have a non-live blockchain / a chain that goes down)
882,2022-11-19 18:05:56+00:00,tarunchitra,"@Adi_Dommaraju yeah, I'm not 100% sure how to do a bounded liquidity version of a CFMM power perp — we (@alexhevans, @GuilleAngeris) proved something generic for the payoff, but nothing about the liquidity mgmt

https://t.co/Rl9MdXjCDO"
883,2022-11-19 18:02:55+00:00,tarunchitra,@Adi_Dommaraju Everlasting options also sort of seem weirdly manipulable in that people can try to 'grief' you if they can manipulate the oracle to oscillate around the strike price (so your net financing cost grows as Ω(T) where T is the time you've held the asset
884,2022-11-19 18:01:42+00:00,tarunchitra,@Adi_Dommaraju I think power perps as a CFMM are a lot cleaner — you only have to think of one loss function (net loss due to arbitrage / rebalancing) vs. two (funding rate + convexity cost around the strike)
885,2022-11-19 17:50:36+00:00,tarunchitra,"@Adi_Dommaraju Yeah, it is expensive (I think people don't have intuition for how to trade convexity - funding rate vs. perps where it is ~linear - funding rate)"

1090,2022-11-11 15:17:24+00:00,tarunchitra,Continuing to improve both decentralized lending and treasury management are the most important things that we need to avoid some of the abjectly abysmal and frankly almost criminally negligent off-chain risk management that we’ve seen in the last 6 months
1091,2022-11-11 15:17:23+00:00,tarunchitra,"If you look on-chain, Alameda paid back it’s DeFi loans way before it covered anything in CeFi (because they couldn’t say, “trust me bro, don’t liquidate me” to a smart contract) — if you can’t see how this is the future of avoiding calamities, I don’t know what to say"
1092,2022-11-11 15:17:22+00:00,tarunchitra,"The beauty of DeFi is that you:
a) Are able to adjust loan-to-values publicly
b) Make liquidations competitive and algorithmically enforceable

Combined, these lead to no sweetheart deals like “locked FTT loans, only 5% interest” that never get liquidated even when in default"
1093,2022-11-11 15:17:22+00:00,tarunchitra,Even more embarrassing is the fact that most CeFi lenders didn’t do (as far I can tell) their own liquidations of collateral — they would simply send it to an OTC broker (like Alameda — who probably liquidated their own loans!) and hope things checked out 🫡
1094,2022-11-11 15:17:21+00:00,tarunchitra,The fact that Voyager never liquidated FTT or SRM and that exchanges were sitting on so much GBTC and *still* didn’t decrease loan-to-values for their largest customers is insanely irresponsible risk management — and it is 100x easier to adjust this as a CeFi lender than in DeFi
1095,2022-11-11 15:17:19+00:00,tarunchitra,"The most amazing thing in the filings is how abysmal centralized lenders (incl. exchanges) were at 2 critical functions:
1. Dynamically setting loan-to-values
2. Liquidating bad loans

2191,2022-08-05 02:34:08+00:00,tarunchitra,TCS people don’t care about ever defining the probability space correctly or in any generality so they “only” know incomplete probability spaces and hence run into these interesting and surprising counterexamples a lot
2192,2022-08-05 02:33:22+00:00,tarunchitra,The sort of problem with assuming completeness or Polish spaces is that you conveniently ignore the fact that there are sometimes natural generative processes that weakly converge for finite n but don’t strongly converge in the limit
2193,2022-08-05 02:32:33+00:00,tarunchitra,Probabilists often exclude these things when constructing probability spaces so they don’t have an ability to realize thst such examples say something about prob. distributions over instances of algorithms with dynamic processes (which could lead to CDFs with point masses @ ♾
2194,2022-08-05 02:30:52+00:00,tarunchitra,One complement that I’ll give theoretical CS people over probabilists is that TCS people are really good at coming up with counterexamples that involve randomized algorithms with point masses at infinity (e.g. a CDF never reaches 1 in finite time)

2788,2022-06-19 23:09:38+00:00,tarunchitra,@badcryptobitch I don’t think so; a lot of the consensus or ZK parameters are actually tied to how good or bad these bounds are

2790,2022-06-19 23:07:09+00:00,tarunchitra,"@sergey_nog I think the thing I don’t like is that negligible in the security parameter k  leads to Chernoff bounds like,

Pr[X &lt; t] &lt; O(exp(polylog(k)))

But these are quite coarse (“barely superpolynomial”); I’ll bet you get stronger security proofs for small k with better bounds"

3066,2022-05-28 15:02:43+00:00,tarunchitra,"@llllvvuu @GuilleAngeris A few ideas:
1. Participation quotas: the auction price only clears if &gt;x% of addresses participate
2. Require the DAO treasury to be the initial LP, ensuring a floor on % of supply participating
3. Locking tokens that participate in the auction until &gt;x% of supply is involved"

3071,2022-05-28 04:35:12+00:00,tarunchitra,@llllvvuu @GuilleAngeris You can effectively promise earlier liquidity providers a discount to final clearing if they lock their liquidity until the realization event (e.g. enough liquidity added)
3072,2022-05-28 04:34:38+00:00,tarunchitra,"@llllvvuu @GuilleAngeris Yeah, you need to adjust how aggressively you use the spot price as clearing price based on curvature; you get to some threshold of curvature and reserves / supply before you allow the price to be used (a bit like a bank filling an M&amp;A table)"

3075,2022-05-28 04:27:49+00:00,tarunchitra,@Jash__Desai @GuilleAngeris Yeah you need a lot of safeguards (it’s really more like a continuous auction with the CFMM pool used when there’s enough liquidity and a more discrete auction to bootstrap – but too many deets for a tweet!)

5884,2021-12-20 16:21:17+00:00,tarunchitra,"The idea of using optimization theory style proofs instead of cryptographic proofs to prove optimality is something we haven't seen in DeFi yet but something that could be very powerful as the next generation of CFMMs are developed 

SoS Proofs, c.f. https://t.co/PjECp3mNyE"
5885,2021-12-20 16:21:16+00:00,tarunchitra,"C. Question: How can I be *certain* that a provider like 1inch or Matcha has *actually* computed the best route for me? You could demand a ZKP, but that's overkill and would take forever to prove

MICPs, however, admit Sum-of-Squares proofs that can be used to certify optimality"
5886,2021-12-20 16:21:16+00:00,tarunchitra,"B. What if instead we said, ""can we design a CFMM such that the routing problem [e.g. the MICP] is easy?"" This is in the vein of @algo_class's ""Theory of DeFi?"" talk — if we invert the design problem, we might get much richer phenomena / better protocols

https://t.co/yfyukjnVdF"
5887,2021-12-20 16:21:15+00:00,tarunchitra,"There are a few meta and philosophical observations to make

A. To date, the majority of CFMM development has been, ""create a CFMM invariant (e.g. xy=k), see how the payoff behaves."" 

@PrimitiveFi is the first to change that with their RMM implementation (fit CFMM to a payoff)"
5888,2021-12-20 16:21:15+00:00,tarunchitra,"The paper gives a number of examples, both analytic and numerical, for different CFMMs and we illustrate how routing changes as a function of trade size t

Okay, cool, we have this framework for routing and even a freshman CS major can write code for solving it. So what? https://t.co/dsjxyT9u3B"
5889,2021-12-20 16:21:14+00:00,tarunchitra,"5. Finally, we generalize the problem to one with transaction costs and show that it is not convex; however, it *can* be solved with an mixed-integer convex program [MICP] (like Mosek/Gurobi) — which is awesome, you can throw computers at the problem not peoples' chalkboards! https://t.co/bSuiFNKcEM"
5890,2021-12-20 16:21:13+00:00,tarunchitra,"4. Remember how if a CFMM has a fee γ, then there's a price interval ~ [1/(1-γ) spot, (1+γ) spot] where arbitrageurs are unprofitable (e.g. CFMM price is stale)?

We generalize that interval to the multi-CFMM case using Lagrange Multipliers λ (yes, freshman calc is still useful) https://t.co/gt43yDSbsL"
5891,2021-12-20 16:21:12+00:00,tarunchitra,"2. Define a general flow vector Ψ that captures the trades executed within a single CFMM vs. the others routed through multiple CFMMs

3.  Given a utility function U(Ψ), we construct a fee-less problem for optimal routing and show that its convex (= easy to solve numerically) https://t.co/cb2akDLoj8"
5892,2021-12-20 16:21:12+00:00,tarunchitra,"Unlike prior academic work that focused on explicit analytic max-flow solutions for routing (which only works for the simplest CFMMs, like Uniswap), we take a computational approach 👇🏾

1. Frame the problem as a matching-like problem on a bipartite graph made of CFMMs and tokens https://t.co/9nXhQbd89T"
5893,2021-12-20 16:21:11+00:00,tarunchitra,"Routing's importance to the CFMM ecosystem was highlighted last week when Uniswap added a new router (the previous one on the UI had significantly worse paths than 1inch/Matcha) that works across chains and L2s
 
But how do you assess a router's quality?

5894,2021-12-20 16:21:10+00:00,tarunchitra,"The growth of the CFMM markets in 2020 and 2021 was driven in large part by routing services such as @1inch, @SlingshotCrypto, and @matchaxyz, which allowed users to get better prices when going trading assets A to B by

6603,2021-10-16 22:37:00+00:00,tarunchitra,@jessepollak @paulgambill @nori The problem is you can’t really measure the rate of growth of verifiable sellers (especially if the probability of detecting fraud correctly is low) whereas the demand side for buyers is gigantic (and will grow due to regulatory reasons)
6604,2021-10-16 21:21:23+00:00,tarunchitra,@Jibishot My main qualm is that you can’t audit if the quantity of credits that the seller is selling is actually equal to the amount of carbon they have offset irl (which is an oracle problem)

6608,2021-10-16 21:11:22+00:00,tarunchitra,"@MaxGlass @macrocephalopod Depends on the environment and it is t a static number — for instance, if I’m offsetting US carbon emissions with Amazon trees, does it matter? The Amazonian trees might do much less for sequestration relative to their local environments. I don’t think it is so simple"
6609,2021-10-16 21:09:58+00:00,tarunchitra,@MaxGlass Who does the auditing? Can I verify the audit myself? This is where the “who watches the watchmen” problem comes in — and the market is so big that there’s a lot of incentive for companies and auditors to collude here
6610,2021-10-16 21:07:59+00:00,tarunchitra,@macrocephalopod How do you verify that they actually did create lower emissions? It’s an oracle problem that relies on self reporting in most cases

6897,2021-10-02 19:42:50+00:00,tarunchitra,n here is some compatible measure of liquidity (number of resting orders and/or discretization of the amount of liquidity locked into a CFMM pool)

6910,2021-10-01 20:49:32+00:00,tarunchitra,@GunLuigi @edzitron It’s a minimal indivisible unit — an NFT is transferrable as sell the whole thing or nothing (just like the coin). You can construct derivatives that represent fractional pieces (likely illegal for the trillion dollar coin). The NF refers to minimal unit not transferability

6915,2021-10-01 20:40:46+00:00,tarunchitra,@edzitron First point I made is about a lack of fungibility (you have to transfer all units at once and can’t fractionalize). The second point is re: asset value — the market implied asset value (just like one for an NFT) comes from the ability to resell or borrow against (treasury yields)

10065,2021-04-09 01:20:06+00:00,tarunchitra,"Summary: fair ordering protocols are a real solution, but they’re far from perfect (both theoretically and in production code). MEV auctions are much less technically difficult and don’t worsen UX as much (which is why I took offense to @AriJuels usage of ""theft"")"
10066,2021-04-09 01:20:06+00:00,tarunchitra,"MEV auctions are a lot easier to reason about, especially with regards to how they compose with consensus and even then, one has to be diligent and careful with practical implementations"
10067,2021-04-09 01:20:05+00:00,tarunchitra,"Back to the main narrative: this complexity means that we don’t know how well these fair ordering protocols compose with main consensus except in synchronous BFT settings. This is bad for practical Blockchains — not impossible, but will need a helluva lot of engineering"

10069,2021-04-09 01:20:05+00:00,tarunchitra,"3. Many of the fair order protocols are quite complex with good reason: they’re solving a much more difficult combinatorial problem of optimal ordering of interlacing permutations (one for block ordering and one for txn ordering)

order matters ➡️ can’t do greedy maximal matching https://t.co/erlo7CL9OM"
10070,2021-04-09 01:20:04+00:00,tarunchitra,"All of the fair ordering solutions are oblivious to transaction value / content and only care about consistency of a distributed priority queue vs users expressed preferences/DSIC-style guarantees 

Is this better? I’m not sure — user intent now relies on latency more than before"
10071,2021-04-09 01:20:03+00:00,tarunchitra,2. MEV Auctions have 1 nice property: they separate the Veblen good-like bidders (liquidators/arbs) from “daily” txns and guarantee price ordering as a function of transaction _value_ is preferred if auction is appropriately ε-close to DSIC (@suryabakshi has more precise conds.)
10072,2021-04-09 01:20:03+00:00,tarunchitra,"Recent papers from @algo_class and Joachim Neu show lower bounds on these latencies and it is very unclear if the practical implementations even come close to saturating these bounds (Kelkar, et. al get to weaker bounds in their paper) https://t.co/mGPus27sdi"
10073,2021-04-09 01:20:01+00:00,tarunchitra,"Why added latency?

Theoretical  (@vegaprotocol’s Wendy) and practical protocols (@valardragon) add a &gt;= 1 block commit-reveal from validators OR added rounds of BFT-style message passing. Griefing vectors (DDoS-esque) are abundant + provable models have weak synchrony guarantees"

One thing I will say is that most of the fair methodologies have a downsides themselves:
1. Added latency
2. Lack of guarantees about economic price ordering
3. Extremely unproven in production (similar to ZKPs in 2012)"

10179,2021-03-29 13:02:58+00:00,tarunchitra,"@ArthurB Yes, but my point was that:
a. The way you take the limit depends on the order arrival process
b. The distribution on positive functions depends on this limit 
c. The Greeks of options you sell depend on this limit

Hence the non-uniqueness (which is why it isn't a red herring)"
10180,2021-03-29 12:55:40+00:00,tarunchitra,"@ArthurB This is encoded in how you take the limit, which dictates what you converge to and bounds on error"
10181,2021-03-29 12:53:18+00:00,tarunchitra,@ArthurB The choice of f_n will dictate the distribution of observed OB (and my point is more that the representation of the limit distibution might be more concise with f_n OB_n vs. g_n OB'_n in that |f_n OB_n - OB| = o(|g_n OB'_n|)

10183,2021-03-29 12:48:12+00:00,tarunchitra,@ArthurB Taking the limit as 1/sqrt(tick size) vs. taking the limit as 1/tick size^3/2 will give you different limit order books because the finite tick size arrival time process is atomic (e.g. limit of sums of Poissons / level)
10184,2021-03-29 12:43:39+00:00,tarunchitra,"@ArthurB Sure, but two things:
1. The uncertainly introduced by positive tick size is why pricing the replicating strike has uncertainty

12764,2020-09-09 16:52:38+00:00,tarunchitra,"@martinkrung This is akin to a hedge fund redemption: I make a redemption request, two ways it can be processed:

b. in a few weeks but in fiat (e.g. the fund goes and sells shares / rebalances to meet my request)

Latter is lockup"

- You're issued non-transferrable LP shares

Yes — by, surprisingly, turning to DeFi!"

Out of curiosity, do you think that consumers will psychologically respond better to receiving an interest payment or getting a discount (e.g. like Gemini gave and/or for volume)?
