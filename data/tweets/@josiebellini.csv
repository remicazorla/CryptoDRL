251,2023-01-03 14:46:40+00:00,josiebellini,"It's been a big jump for me going from an artist/creative to a business leader, but I'm learning as I go and feeling proud of what I've accomplished. 

What is the biggest thing you learned this past year that you are going to apply to your professional life in 2023?"
252,2023-01-03 14:46:40+00:00,josiebellini,It's been disheartening because I never experienced the “woman” in business hurdles even when I worked in industries that are notoriously the worst for women (finance). I regret thinking that people just needed thicker skin. There is definitely truth behind the stories.
253,2023-01-03 14:46:39+00:00,josiebellini,"I know you may roll your eyes at this one. Regrettably, I have in the past too.
This year I've experienced firsthand the lack of respect that can come w/ being a woman in business. I've had terrible experiences w/ 3rd parties who treated me like dirt bc they saw me as weak."
254,2023-01-03 14:46:39+00:00,josiebellini,"I learned to listen more than you talk.  Learn from everyone.  Learn from your team, learn from people that have had huge success, learn people that have had crushing failures. Listening and understanding will take you far."
255,2023-01-03 14:46:38+00:00,josiebellini,"Oh but one note from the lesson above... there is a rigged system. You have to know that most of the other businesses around you are playing the game. Paid shills, purchased followers, false hype, straight up sharks.

You have to decide what you are willing or not willing to do."
256,2023-01-03 14:46:38+00:00,josiebellini,"I learned the importance of marketing. You can build the best product or service out there, but if you're not shouting from the rooftops about it, no one will know. This one is still a work in progress, but you will see a lot more of me :)"
257,2023-01-03 14:46:37+00:00,josiebellini,"As the founder, it's important to only focus on the things that only you can do. (I'm still working on this!)

The 85% rule: if someone else on the team can do something 85% as well as you can, let them take the lead. Only do what only you can do so that you can grow the business"
258,2023-01-03 14:46:36+00:00,josiebellini,"I learned that building a team of A players is exceptionally hard. It takes forever to find people with skill, passion, and drive but that extra time and effort is ALWAYS worth it.

The wrong people can be a huge detriment to your company."

450,2022-12-02 14:50:13+00:00,josiebellini,"The color variants of “Don’t Feed the Pigeons” are all named after graffiti, stickers, or signs found in New York. 

There is a special nod hidden in the SVG layers to a very special friend, R.I.P. @money_alotta, love from all of the beautiful creatures here missing you."
451,2022-12-02 14:50:12+00:00,josiebellini,"As the many signs read “Don’t Feed the Pigeons”, or do, but at least stop to appreciate the beautiful life - big and small - that creates the beating pulse of New York City."
452,2022-12-02 14:50:12+00:00,josiebellini,"Over the years, like a true New Yorker, they have scrappily adapted to their new environment, thriving in a concrete jungle built for mankind. Despite their fall in status, they are still as intertwined with the city as Lady Liberty."
453,2022-12-02 14:50:11+00:00,josiebellini,"Some kept as pets, some used as mail carriers with their intelligence &amp; navigational skills, others decorated w/ medals of honor for saving thousands of lives in war or stranded boats out at sea. In fact, pigeons were brought to America on the first-ever expeditions from Europe."
454,2022-12-02 14:50:09+00:00,josiebellini,"Pigeons have a bad rep. Sure, people see them as pests now, but starting even earlier than 4500 BCE (6,500 years ago), it was a different story. Once considered a beautiful companion, pigeons were highly respected creatures."
455,2022-12-02 14:50:09+00:00,josiebellini,"Hustling down a New York City street, under a sea of towering skyscrapers &amp; kaleidoscopes of light, a gust of air rushes through your hair as a dozen pigeons take flight around you. Their silvery gray feathers glow blue, red, &amp; purple from the hues above. Don’t they look regal?"

I first got into crypto and NFTs in 2017. I was reading, learning, going to meetups, and ended up finding a home in crypto. 

The first thing I realized was that I could take control of my own financial freedom. https://t.co/XBfLDjtSDW"

But the most exciting is seeing individuals from all backgrounds become fully immersed &amp; watching them create something out of nothing

1352,2021-02-15 06:41:44+00:00,josiebellini,"Btw, this is not a slight to anyone that has done an open edition NFT, it is just not something I will be doing with my own art."
1353,2021-02-15 05:40:38+00:00,josiebellini,"@Edmond5858 @nodradek @gmoneyNFT I rarely do 1/1s, I price below market value, and I have given NFTs away for free which are now being sold for thousands. So this has allowed me to build a community of ""minnows"" instead of whales"
1354,2021-02-15 05:37:30+00:00,josiebellini,@Edmond5858 @nodradek @gmoneyNFT I have done. I prefer limited edition pieces and I sell them 1 per person at 1st come 1st served basis at a fixed price. I typically try to price below market value. This has worked for me and my community so this is why i wouldnt personally do an OE
1355,2021-02-15 05:36:38+00:00,josiebellini,@Edmond5858 @nodradek @gmoneyNFT Totally agree about artist intent and delivery. I have seen a couple of open editions that were really interesting to me. And I am by no means saying they are all bad or cash grabs. I am saying to my community - it's not my personal jam. I can count on 1 hand how many 1/1s...
1356,2021-02-15 05:24:19+00:00,josiebellini,"@Edmond5858 @nodradek @gmoneyNFT I think artists know their own communities and know what works for their brands. For me personally, I feel like OE NFTs can seem like cash grabs (unless priced cheaply). 

When you say bring collectors from all tiers what pricing are you thinking of? I see many OE priced @ $1000."
1357,2021-02-15 04:49:10+00:00,josiebellini,@nodradek @gmoneyNFT Here I am talking about open edition NFTs which means there is an uncapped supply

1526,2020-10-17 15:39:21+00:00,josiebellini,"""Tune In"" acrylic painting was my 1st NFT based work, &amp; the 1st painting I ever tokenized. What makes it even more special is that it was sold with NFT #0 which is the first token ever created on my Josie contract.

The original painting and NFT #0 bundle is now for sale 🔥🔥🔥 https://t.co/UBVneFZRQx"
1527,2020-10-16 14:53:04+00:00,josiebellini,"@xanderatallah @opensea #1 and #4 for sure 🔥🔥. Would also love global bids, for ex: I’ll buy any parcel in @cryptovoxels in the Gangnam neighborhood for 2ETH. And then once it’s fulfilled, it closes. Then I don’t have to spend tx fees on bidding on 20 parcels. Or I’ll buy any @JohnOrionYoung for X ETH"
