33,2022-11-09 10:08:55+00:00,lisajytan,"TLDR: the takeaway is that CZ's tweet of FTT dumping cause fud and we see a 27.5% increase in withdrawal from FTX

CZ's interest in purchasing FTX seems confusing to me. how is this a strategic move in the long-run, i am not sure actually

too dumb to see a bigger picture here"
34,2022-11-09 10:08:55+00:00,lisajytan,"a second game theory way to think about this is, if CZ does not come in to save FTX, the future expected value of FTX as a company is ZERO. Nada. Nothing. So why pay when you can get the market share for free instead."

38,2022-11-09 10:08:52+00:00,lisajytan,to boost a L1? I'm sure SOL has its other investors and ecosystem that is not only reliant on FTX/SBF. and Binance has BSC to care about. not purchasing this to get easy access to SOL.

127,2022-07-17 06:28:51+00:00,lisajytan,"But before you implement this, think about the risks in place. A huge risk when it comes to doing due diligence for such token model is the ""value creation"" component of (a) staking and (b) increasing lock-up periods."
128,2022-07-17 06:28:50+00:00,lisajytan,"Your goal as an economist/designer/gov: create healthy balance of inflationary and deflationary factors. Inflation comes from value creation, deflation comes from value realisation."
129,2022-07-17 06:28:49+00:00,lisajytan,"3. Then, inject fresh liquidity to areas that require liquidity for value creation. You would not have the effect of liquidation from staked tokens, to compete with the fresh liquidity to create inflation."
130,2022-07-17 06:28:49+00:00,lisajytan,2. You can either increase staking reasons or you increase the unlocking period of the staked tokens.
131,2022-07-17 06:28:49+00:00,lisajytan,"How can you do this? 3 steps.

1. By locking up tokens so it does not increase the total available and liquid circulating quantity of tokens."
132,2022-07-17 06:28:48+00:00,lisajytan,"What can #gamefi learn to control inflation &amp; corresponding risks

TLDR: When injecting fresh liquidity, you could trigger inflation, especially when the tokens are currently not being used for value creation. So you need to find a way to reduce the inflationary impact."

136,2022-07-16 02:57:00+00:00,lisajytan,And that’s where analytics comes in.
137,2022-07-16 02:56:59+00:00,lisajytan,How is this related to crypto? You can start measuring the power and resilience of networks from both economic systems AND its corresponding economic agents engaging in this ecosystem
138,2022-07-16 02:56:59+00:00,lisajytan,"And on that note, it’s impt to know who is in the nation state. And how “invested” are they in the nation state. Are they spending 50% on fb, 50% on Twitter? Or 30-70?"

This is related to the game play. The game play goes hand in hand with game economy and they work together to aid users in creating value for the growth of the game."
157,2022-06-19 12:54:19+00:00,lisajytan,"3. Risk. The risk I see with game economies is that they are focusing just on short-term value distribution and not long-term value creation. (This is not just Axie, obviously. Many other games face the same thing - #Pegaxy, #Crabada, etc) https://t.co/GmAPxrkSeE"
158,2022-06-19 12:54:17+00:00,lisajytan,"Anyway, we can see the economy losing users/network effects because it stops creating real (not just nominal) value to users. And inflation only highlights the issue and drive users away."
159,2022-06-19 12:54:17+00:00,lisajytan,Less SLP traded is a proxy for less DAU. More SLP sale (red) than bought (green) is also not a good since as it shows that users seem to be looking to exist the system
160,2022-06-19 12:54:16+00:00,lisajytan,"Why SLP instead of AXS? Because SLP is more useful now, than AXS, in the gameplay, which makes it a better proxy to measure DAU, since DAU is not available."
161,2022-06-19 12:54:16+00:00,lisajytan,"And we see that with the falling DAU of SLP is stark.

166,2022-06-19 12:54:13+00:00,lisajytan,"So when networks (ie. economies, countries) reduce in value creation, and all other things equal, another network is creating value, the another network becomes more attractive to people to participate."

170,2022-06-19 12:54:10+00:00,lisajytan,"1. Explanation

Simple words: country A stops growing (creating value) but prices of goods keep rising. Comparing A to country B who is growing, with the same rising prices of goods, country B is more attractive. 
Thus, people flock to country B."

4. Combine interests of agents to balance the supply &amp; demand"

212,2022-05-19 08:21:10+00:00,lisajytan,"@___spiral____ As for “finance the parts to build it” - it depends on what the token is used for. If it’s for financing, then Yeap that makes sense. Check out DAICO &amp; augmented bonding curve. I have a video on YouTube comparing both"
213,2022-05-19 08:19:16+00:00,lisajytan,@___spiral____ We *define* and then study the impacts of the various ways of distribution. Rmb that distribution is a means to an end - the end is the behaviours you want to incentivise. Tokens are man made constraints of the token based system you’re designing

245,2022-04-24 04:34:02+00:00,lisajytan,"Again, it’s not to predict the prices of the native token or assets but to explore how the first principles and fundamental drivers affects the macro environment"
246,2022-04-24 04:34:02+00:00,lisajytan,We designed @playSHRAPNEL looking at dynamic systems in mind. We designed the mechanisms to allow players to interact and then tested them out with various loops and measuring the sustainability of the loops.
247,2022-04-24 04:29:19+00:00,lisajytan,"This is super critical because everyone thinks that when you define the “tokenomics” (wtv that word means), your system is static and deterministic. It is the furthest from that"
248,2022-04-24 04:28:13+00:00,lisajytan,"Another thing to note is that dynamic systems are kinda like deterministic complex systems. You can’t predict what happens. 

!!! But you can run your Monte Carlo to explore the various outcomes unfolding."
249,2022-04-24 03:55:36+00:00,lisajytan,And the key to all of that? Information. Information to reduce time lag between agents interacting within your system.
250,2022-04-24 03:55:36+00:00,lisajytan,More info to come soon. Basically the most crucial determinant is not the mechanisms but it’s function/purpose when people interact with the said mechanisms.
251,2022-04-24 03:55:35+00:00,lisajytan,"That means, everyone can build systems. Some systems are less wrong than others.

But can everyone maintain it? I’d say no. And that is key to success. Maintaining resilient systems."
252,2022-04-24 03:55:34+00:00,lisajytan,And this is why key to success is not “send me your white paper so I can understand the token economics”. The key to success is the maintenance of these behavioural patterns by agents over time.
253,2022-04-24 03:55:34+00:00,lisajytan,"In systems, we want to design, understand and measure the structure  (ex-ante) and behaviour (ex-post) to study the results and improve behavioural patterns."
254,2022-04-24 03:55:33+00:00,lisajytan,A protocol is just a system with some interactions governed in code like smart contract.
255,2022-04-24 03:46:19+00:00,lisajytan,"What examples of the first principle we’re talking about here? 

1. Everything is a system. It is affected in a dynamic not static way
2. They are interconnected (coordination &amp; collaboration btn agents)
3. Incentives, mechanisms and rules affect the way agents interconnect"
256,2022-04-24 03:39:00+00:00,lisajytan,"It’s counterintuitive, of course. first principle IS first principle. It’s an axiom. The risk is then using the correct first principle on a wrong situation. That’s the risk."
257,2022-04-24 03:38:59+00:00,lisajytan,"The beautiful thing is that everything we do when designing and maintaining protocols, we pretty much follow the same first principles in the company. One stone killing many birds. But it does put the all the risk in one basket. If the first principle is wrong, it’s all fucked."
258,2022-04-24 02:00:02+00:00,lisajytan,"So during the week, I met with a founder and we were just discussing about how we run our companies and your general founder problems.

Uniswap has an external fee. One time fee for executing trade, no matter the size. This is called CFMM. Internal fee means to add the transaction fee in the model so big trade = big fees. Called CLP model, inspired by @thorchain_org"

1) adding a validators node system.

And yes. In fact, I'd word it this way instead 👉🏻 the output token can increase its economic value by having real utility (aka use-cases). Which is the example you said."
2172,2020-09-13 06:59:22+00:00,lisajytan,"Next step: 
combining (1) and (2) above. So you have 1 side of volatile asset (aka exposure. aka risk) and the other side is of low volatility. 

And that's the AMM mechanism for StableCredit at @iearnfinance"

Does this make sense?"
2187,2020-09-12 07:56:58+00:00,lisajytan,"@simondlr Good question. The medium post didn't address that issue yet. I'd imagine this situation:

$LINK drops = use less sUSD to claim LINK. -&gt; now people want to claim LINK from pool w sUSD
So overall pool -&gt; more LINK &amp; less sUSD
In that way, it automatically goes back to a lower %"
2188,2020-09-12 07:42:51+00:00,lisajytan,@calchulus Yes! That's why curve is arguably more successful than other exchanges (like Uniswap) because similar stable priced assets with lower volatility reduces that risk.

2192,2020-09-12 00:57:38+00:00,lisajytan,"7) Now, how does it apply to yield farming? Bc this information and system has no economic value if people don't use it, right? 

(A) Use that new stable asset to be doing your whatever farming field. Like a fertiliser. 
(B) Reduces vol with the stability, so easy to cal returns"
2193,2020-09-12 00:57:37+00:00,lisajytan,"6) Now, question. What does that.... stable asset do then? 

Simple.
(A) you get to collect the collaterals in the AMM
(B) you get to use it in the #defi system bc it's pegged and has value. E.g. use it to borrow assets in Yearn."
2194,2020-09-12 00:57:36+00:00,lisajytan,"5.5) Combine (3) and (4), you realise that the asset will move quite a bit right? And when that happens, you have this thing called impermanent loss. 

Impermanent loss is a bad thing. Bad for asset holders in the AMM, can be bad for traders. So reduce this by reducing vol."
2195,2020-09-12 00:57:35+00:00,lisajytan,"5) Another point on the stable asset in the single-sided AMM: this helps to reduce (remove, maybe? I can't justify if it removes it for real) impermanent loss when trading."
2196,2020-09-12 00:57:34+00:00,lisajytan,"4) Lastly, it uses @AmpleforthOrg's model of tapping into secondary market for traders to do arbitrage to get the pegged value back to its ideal state. 

Why would they do that? Bc traders get to make money. Duh. 

Win-win-win."
2197,2020-09-12 00:57:33+00:00,lisajytan,"3.5) Now, @iearnfinance goes a little further and say, ""ok we don't want this new native token to be traded in the secondary market. Bc volatility sucks. So what can we do?"" 

Simple. We make that new native token a stable token with a pegged value. Which brings us to (4)"
2198,2020-09-12 00:57:32+00:00,lisajytan,3) How does the INTERNAL economy work then? It uses a single-sided AMM to mint the tokens. Confused? Think of it as @Bancor but BNT (the native token of Bancor) is not traded in the secondary market. So you reduce exposure for fluctuation.
2199,2020-09-12 00:57:31+00:00,lisajytan,2) Using @AaveAave's lending protocol so you can borrow up to 75% of the collaterals you provided (see 1 above)
2200,2020-09-12 00:57:31+00:00,lisajytan,"If i can sum it up, it is combining 4 existing projects together:

2884,2019-05-14 00:04:49+00:00,lisajytan,7/ The creation of new tasks and other technologies raising the labor intensity of production and the labor share are vital for continued wage growth commensurate with productivity growth.
2885,2019-05-14 00:04:48+00:00,lisajytan,"6/ Automation by itself always reduces the labor share in industry value added and tends to reduce the overall labor share in the economy (meaning that it leads to slower wage growth than productivity growth). On net, labor retained a key role in production."

2887,2019-05-14 00:04:47+00:00,lisajytan,4/ Some automation technologies may in fact reduce labor demand because they bring sizable displacement effects but modest productivity gains (especially when substituted workers were cheap to begin with and the automated technology is only marginally better than them).
2888,2019-05-14 00:04:47+00:00,lisajytan,"3/ Instead, the displacement effect of automation has been counterbalanced by technologies that create new tasks in which labor has a comparative advantage."
2889,2019-05-14 00:04:46+00:00,lisajytan,2/ The displacement effect implies that automation reduces the labor share of value added. The net impact of automation on labor demand thus depends on how the displacement and productivity effects weigh against each other.
2890,2019-05-14 00:04:46+00:00,lisajytan,1/ Automation and Labour Effect: Automation changes the task content of production adversely for labor because of a displacement effect—as capital takes over tasks previously performed by labor.
