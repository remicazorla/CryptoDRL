34,2022-11-09 10:08:55+00:00,lisajytan,"a second game theory way to think about this is, if CZ does not come in to save FTX, the future expected value of FTX as a company is ZERO. Nada. Nothing. So why pay when you can get the market share for free instead."

Hot take: P2E is never sustainable if the main incentive for its users is the financial incentives."
127,2022-07-17 06:28:51+00:00,lisajytan,"But before you implement this, think about the risks in place. A huge risk when it comes to doing due diligence for such token model is the ""value creation"" component of (a) staking and (b) increasing lock-up periods."
128,2022-07-17 06:28:50+00:00,lisajytan,"Your goal as an economist/designer/gov: create healthy balance of inflationary and deflationary factors. Inflation comes from value creation, deflation comes from value realisation."
129,2022-07-17 06:28:49+00:00,lisajytan,"3. Then, inject fresh liquidity to areas that require liquidity for value creation. You would not have the effect of liquidation from staked tokens, to compete with the fresh liquidity to create inflation."
130,2022-07-17 06:28:49+00:00,lisajytan,2. You can either increase staking reasons or you increase the unlocking period of the staked tokens.
131,2022-07-17 06:28:49+00:00,lisajytan,"How can you do this? 3 steps.

1. By locking up tokens so it does not increase the total available and liquid circulating quantity of tokens."
132,2022-07-17 06:28:48+00:00,lisajytan,"What can #gamefi learn to control inflation &amp; corresponding risks

TLDR: When injecting fresh liquidity, you could trigger inflation, especially when the tokens are currently not being used for value creation. So you need to find a way to reduce the inflationary impact."

Not a bad thing. It‚Äôs just regulation to smooth consumption over a longer time period without triggering 2 much inflation"
136,2022-07-16 02:57:00+00:00,lisajytan,And that‚Äôs where analytics comes in.
137,2022-07-16 02:56:59+00:00,lisajytan,How is this related to crypto? You can start measuring the power and resilience of networks from both economic systems AND its corresponding economic agents engaging in this ecosystem
138,2022-07-16 02:56:59+00:00,lisajytan,"And on that note, it‚Äôs impt to know who is in the nation state. And how ‚Äúinvested‚Äù are they in the nation state. Are they spending 50% on fb, 50% on Twitter? Or 30-70?"
139,2022-07-16 02:56:58+00:00,lisajytan,Option 2: you now don‚Äôt need to own Twitter and Facebook to understand their user behaviour and profile then compare them to create that venn diagram of users that use both apps.

The theoretical token design/behaviour vs actual behaviour of token holders. maybe due to irrationality, maybe due to sunk cost fallacy."
147,2022-07-10 05:26:34+00:00,lisajytan,"There are 2 types of tokenisation models in DeFi:

1. Tokens as a coordination tool to incentive certain behaviour: utility token, governance token
2. Tokens as a digital structured product"
148,2022-07-10 01:55:34+00:00,lisajytan,"As much as we can build resilient from an economic systems design perspective, aligning interests between owners and users to increase skin in the game is also important.

156,2022-06-19 12:54:19+00:00,lisajytan,"Focus on value-creation. 
This is related to the game play. The game play goes hand in hand with game economy and they work together to aid users in creating value for the growth of the game."
157,2022-06-19 12:54:19+00:00,lisajytan,"3. Risk. The risk I see with game economies is that they are focusing just on short-term value distribution and not long-term value creation. (This is not just Axie, obviously. Many other games face the same thing - #Pegaxy, #Crabada, etc) https://t.co/GmAPxrkSeE"
158,2022-06-19 12:54:17+00:00,lisajytan,"Anyway, we can see the economy losing users/network effects because it stops creating real (not just nominal) value to users. And inflation only highlights the issue and drive users away."
159,2022-06-19 12:54:17+00:00,lisajytan,Less SLP traded is a proxy for less DAU. More SLP sale (red) than bought (green) is also not a good since as it shows that users seem to be looking to exist the system
160,2022-06-19 12:54:16+00:00,lisajytan,"Why SLP instead of AXS? Because SLP is more useful now, than AXS, in the gameplay, which makes it a better proxy to measure DAU, since DAU is not available."
161,2022-06-19 12:54:16+00:00,lisajytan,"And we see that with the falling DAU of SLP is stark. 

Chart: SLP/USDT on Binance, which acc for 32% of trade. And the volume (bottom of chart) has decreased significant. https://t.co/8QYRnMoGmi"
162,2022-06-19 12:54:15+00:00,lisajytan,"Back to the earlier tweet, because in the digital space, people can move between economies (ie countries) easily."
163,2022-06-19 12:54:14+00:00,lisajytan,"Another similar game comes along, be it Zed Run, Pegaxy, or some other similar game. When assets become inflationary expensive and growth stops/significantly reduced - which is highlighted in the market price of the tokens - users are likely to move to another economy."
164,2022-06-19 12:54:14+00:00,lisajytan,"2. Application time. Let's do GameFi. 

Say, Axie Infinity as an economy. The growth was driven by increase in users entering the game. And there was inflation in prices of $AXIE hence the scholarship model."
165,2022-06-19 12:54:13+00:00,lisajytan,Inflation enhances the attractiveness of networks.
166,2022-06-19 12:54:13+00:00,lisajytan,"So when networks (ie. economies, countries) reduce in value creation, and all other things equal, another network is creating value, the another network becomes more attractive to people to participate."
167,2022-06-19 12:54:12+00:00,lisajytan,Networks exist because they create value through trade. See this thread https://t.co/TwSNgsym3L
168,2022-06-19 12:54:12+00:00,lisajytan,"When the value created by the network decreases, the rise in cost of things in the network becomes hard to afford."
169,2022-06-19 12:54:11+00:00,lisajytan,"In the physical world: moving country is hard. 

In the digital world: moving country is easy. Countries are basically networks and economies created by having a community of people coming together to interact."
170,2022-06-19 12:54:10+00:00,lisajytan,"1. Explanation

Simple words: country A stops growing (creating value) but prices of goods keep rising. Comparing A to country B who is growing, with the same rising prices of goods, country B is more attractive. 
Thus, people flock to country B."
171,2022-06-19 12:54:10+00:00,lisajytan,"I say game economy not defi protocol, because games are complex with heterogenous demand/supply functions than defi protocols."
172,2022-06-19 12:54:09+00:00,lisajytan,"TLDR: when you are building your #GameEconomy, make sure value creation is high compared to your competitors (other similar games), and that your monetary policy is working to balance the inflation in your economy.

You can't be inflating or deflating all the time."

4. Combine interests of agents to balance the supply &amp; demand"
177,2022-06-18 00:13:12+00:00,lisajytan,"Why? People specialise and are marginally better at producing goods (ie knowledge, digital assets,etc) hence they focus on that. Someone else focuses on something and you trade with their output"

249,2022-04-24 03:55:36+00:00,lisajytan,And the key to all of that? Information. Information to reduce time lag between agents interacting within your system.
250,2022-04-24 03:55:36+00:00,lisajytan,More info to come soon. Basically the most crucial determinant is not the mechanisms but it‚Äôs function/purpose when people interact with the said mechanisms.

256,2022-04-24 03:39:00+00:00,lisajytan,"It‚Äôs counterintuitive, of course. first principle IS first principle. It‚Äôs an axiom. The risk is then using the correct first principle on a wrong situation. That‚Äôs the risk."

2194,2020-09-12 00:57:36+00:00,lisajytan,"5.5) Combine (3) and (4), you realise that the asset will move quite a bit right? And when that happens, you have this thing called impermanent loss. 

Impermanent loss is a bad thing. Bad for asset holders in the AMM, can be bad for traders. So reduce this by reducing vol."
2195,2020-09-12 00:57:35+00:00,lisajytan,"5) Another point on the stable asset in the single-sided AMM: this helps to reduce (remove, maybe? I can't justify if it removes it for real) impermanent loss when trading."
2196,2020-09-12 00:57:34+00:00,lisajytan,"4) Lastly, it uses @AmpleforthOrg's model of tapping into secondary market for traders to do arbitrage to get the pegged value back to its ideal state. 

Why would they do that? Bc traders get to make money. Duh. 

Win-win-win."
2197,2020-09-12 00:57:33+00:00,lisajytan,"3.5) Now, @iearnfinance goes a little further and say, ""ok we don't want this new native token to be traded in the secondary market. Bc volatility sucks. So what can we do?"" 

Simple. We make that new native token a stable token with a pegged value. Which brings us to (4)"
2198,2020-09-12 00:57:32+00:00,lisajytan,3) How does the INTERNAL economy work then? It uses a single-sided AMM to mint the tokens. Confused? Think of it as @Bancor but BNT (the native token of Bancor) is not traded in the secondary market. So you reduce exposure for fluctuation.
2199,2020-09-12 00:57:31+00:00,lisajytan,2) Using @AaveAave's lending protocol so you can borrow up to 75% of the collaterals you provided (see 1 above)
2200,2020-09-12 00:57:31+00:00,lisajytan,"If i can sum it up, it is combining 4 existing projects together: 

1) Using @MakerDAO's model of multi-collateral in the system, instead of just single asset collateral. You can put whatever asset you want as collaterals."

2885,2019-05-14 00:04:48+00:00,lisajytan,"6/ Automation by itself always reduces the labor share in industry value added and tends to reduce the overall labor share in the economy (meaning that it leads to slower wage growth than productivity growth).
