439,2023-01-29 10:10:46+00:00,Timccopeland,"@WhyWorryChain basically they created more tokens than the circulating supply — but they were locked and never intended to be tradeable

then they burned these extra tokens (locked, not part of circulating supply) — which effectively are worth $0.

440,2023-01-29 10:06:37+00:00,Timccopeland,this explains that these tokens were not part of the circulating supply https://t.co/vxjdMfUzuV
441,2023-01-29 10:04:22+00:00,Timccopeland,"lemme get this straight

floki creates double its token supply to cover two chains, with the idea half is locked up in bridge (not part of circulating supply). Then they burn these tokens that weren't real tokens — and price pumps 40%.

2887,2022-09-29 10:23:24+00:00,Timccopeland,"26/ To summarize:

- This is potentially really bad for DAOs + anyone has who ever voted in a DAO.
- Ooki's legal defense will be really important for the entire DAO space. 
- The Block will make sure to monitor this case closely and keep you updated."
2888,2022-09-29 10:23:04+00:00,Timccopeland,"25/ Full article with Nyman here:

- He breaks down the implications of the CFTC's case and how it might play out.

https://t.co/ySydFvkJ0x"
2889,2022-09-29 10:23:04+00:00,Timccopeland,"24/ “They're kind of putting the DAO in a Catch-22 situation where just because they're a DAO doesn't mean they're not subject to the jurisdiction of the CFTC. But actually, because they're a DAO, they probably can't comply and therefore there's no way for them to be compliant”"
2890,2022-09-29 10:23:03+00:00,Timccopeland,"23/ Could DAOs comply with the regulations in the US?

- Crypto lawyer Matthew Nyman explains that this can't happen with current rules.
- That means this attitude by the CFTC places DAOs in a very awkward spot.

(full quote in next tweet)"
2891,2022-09-29 10:23:03+00:00,Timccopeland,"22/ Or,

- They might focus more on anonymity and hiding member details. 
- This would drive DAO activity underground.
- It means no more cooperation with real-world entities (like MakerDAO is doing)"
2892,2022-09-29 10:23:02+00:00,Timccopeland,"21/How might DAOs adapt going forward?

- They might try to set up legal wrappers in jurisdictions like Wymong or Marshall Islands. 
- But it's debatable whether other jurisdictions (like the US) will respect this."
2893,2022-09-29 10:23:02+00:00,Timccopeland,"20/ How did crypto lawyers respond?

- Not particularly surprised.
- Some said it was a big overreach.
- Some said DAOs should comply with regs.
- Some said this will be hard for CFTC to push through

2894,2022-09-29 10:23:01+00:00,Timccopeland,"19/ + Mersinger criticized its lack of “legal authority” and described it as “blatant ‘regulation by enforcement’.”

Read full letter here: https://t.co/Ax2iceitzX"
2895,2022-09-29 10:23:01+00:00,Timccopeland,"18/ Who disagreed with this course of action?

CFTC Commissioner Summer Mersinger wrote a dissenting opinion arguing that the enforcement was carried out in the wrong way.

She claimed it would be unfair to hold each voter accountable for all actions of the DAO in general."
2896,2022-09-29 10:23:00+00:00,Timccopeland,"17/ How has CFTC been interacting with the DAO?

- Well it filed the civil complaint in court.
- But it has served the DAO by posting the documents on its governance forum. 

See here: https://t.co/brdfgtOX6p"
2897,2022-09-29 10:23:00+00:00,Timccopeland,"16/ One key observation from the Ooki DAO:

- They tend to see it as the CFTC coming after a smaller DAO to set legal precedent for going after bigger players."
2898,2022-09-29 10:22:59+00:00,Timccopeland,"15/ What is Ooki DAO considering?

- Use treasury funds for legal counsel
- Submit legal defense on Gitcoin to get wider support
- Create NFTs to fund legal defense

https://t.co/xL6BB4uzNO"
2899,2022-09-29 10:22:59+00:00,Timccopeland,"14/ What if you've already voted in a DAO like this?

- Well bad luck I'm afraid. Looks like the CFTC may go after you if it can identify you/chooses to go after individuals.
- You should closely monitor the outcome of this case.
- (Perhaps reconsider using ENS names for voting)"
2900,2022-09-29 10:22:58+00:00,Timccopeland,"13/ How many people could this affect?

- There are 2,276 DAOs, according to DeepDAO. 
- These DAOs include 3.9 million governance token holders/wallets and 696,000 active wallets."
2901,2022-09-29 10:22:58+00:00,Timccopeland,"12/ How could this apply to other DAOs?

- It will likely apply to any DAO that provides regulated services, like margin or leveraged trading.
- It may also apply to DAOs providing any kind of illegal or sanctioned services."
2902,2022-09-29 10:22:58+00:00,Timccopeland,"11/ So in short:

- Anyone who voted at least once on Ooki governance — whether it was to change the color of its logo — may end up liable for all actions of the DAO. 
- They may end up facing all of those penalties and consequences."
2903,2022-09-29 10:22:57+00:00,Timccopeland,"10/ What penalties do the CFTC want to impose on DAO members?

- injunction to stop members offering trading services, using regulated exchanges, trading commodity derivatives
- pay back any profits/salaries
- make all investors whole
- pay penalties, costs, fees"
2904,2022-09-29 10:22:57+00:00,Timccopeland,"9/ Could the CFTC go after individuals?

- It's less clear how the CFTC will go about enforcing this, if it gets approved.
- In theory, if they find any DAO members, it will be able to charge them each in full."
2905,2022-09-29 10:22:56+00:00,Timccopeland,"8/ To put it clearly:

“Under this more pessimistic view, if the DAO did something that it could be liable for, everyone involved could be held liable,"" said Will Papper, co-founder of SyndicateDAO."
2906,2022-09-29 10:22:56+00:00,Timccopeland,"7/ Why is this such a problem?

- Well companies were set up to protect individuals against this, limiting their liability (hence a limited liability company).
- Since DAOs actively avoid using company structures, that means members have unlimited liability + jointly liable."
2907,2022-09-29 10:22:55+00:00,Timccopeland,"6/ What does this mean for token holders?

- This means anyone who has voted in Ooki’s DAO may be held liable for any illegal activity that the DAO does/has done.
- Such DAO members may have unlimited liability."
2908,2022-09-29 10:22:55+00:00,Timccopeland,"5/ How does the CFTC define who is part of this DAO?

- Governance token holders who have voted at least once on a governance decision.
- They describe it as an unincorporated association."
2909,2022-09-29 10:22:54+00:00,Timccopeland,"4/ What is the importance of the case?

- Well it means that DAOs are not immune from regulatory enforcement. 
- And that token holders may be liable.
- or, in the CFTC's words: “DAOs are not immune from enforcement and may not violate the law with impunity.”"
2910,2022-09-29 10:22:54+00:00,Timccopeland,"3/ What's the current status?

- Right now, the CFTC is taking the Ooki DAO to court. 
- It will be up to the court to decide if the claims stand up.
- We will see at a later point whether the CFTC gets its way."
2911,2022-09-29 10:22:53+00:00,Timccopeland,"2/ What is the main case?

- The CFTC has gone after the founders of Ooki DAO for running an unregistered futures exchange on multiple blockchains.
- But they have also gone after the DAO itself.
- They have served the DAO with a civil enforcement action.

https://t.co/Mi1wSvAZBX"
2912,2022-09-29 10:22:53+00:00,Timccopeland,"THE CFTC IS GOING AFTER DAOS — HOW DOES THIS AFFECT YOU?

Big questions: 
- What is happening?
- How will it affect DAOs?
- How does it affect token holders?

+ Ooki’s legal defense will be really important for the entire DAO space.

it's basically a collateralized stablecoin with reserves used for market making"

4310,2022-06-20 09:59:40+00:00,Timccopeland,"@vishal4c @AJRummer well the whole thing is set up as elastic seigniorage, but i'm fairly sure that if it gets in trouble, it'll just unlock the TRX and just use it as collateral. 

IMO it's a collateralized stablecoin that's pretending to be elastic seigniorage to attract liquidity"
4311,2022-06-20 09:54:17+00:00,Timccopeland,"@vishal4c @AJRummer well no, bcos they have the funds locked up (as ""burned"" TRX) that they can sell to repay all debt if needed. This would avoid the luna burning mechanism — so sure the price might go down a bit, but the supply woudln't change. so no cyclical death spiral."

4999,2022-05-20 13:58:40+00:00,Timccopeland,ffs am i really going to need to write an article on the difference between usdt and ust

5001,2022-05-20 13:55:22+00:00,Timccopeland,and perhaps articles like these just serve to make things worse
5002,2022-05-20 13:55:22+00:00,Timccopeland,"typically the supply of tether has largely only gone up. The only change is the recent large withdrawals, which could have been sparked by fears over UST

meaning people didn't understand the difference between the two stablecoins"
5003,2022-05-20 13:55:22+00:00,Timccopeland,"this seems to imply people offload their tether during a bitcoin price crash.

but if the price is crashing, surely you're happy to be in stables?"
5004,2022-05-20 13:53:48+00:00,Timccopeland,"What i find odd is that when prices drop, people are usually selling their cryptocurrencies. What do you think they're selling them for? Well the most common token pairing is usually against tether.

So surely there's higher buying pressure on usdt during a market drop?"
5005,2022-05-20 13:52:05+00:00,Timccopeland,"this article is written to imply tether's price is dropping and might fall further, just like UST!

but in reality it's a more logistical issue over liquidity during a market crash."
5006,2022-05-20 13:49:45+00:00,Timccopeland,"if tether drops, it creates an arbitrage opportunity. If tether dropped to $0.80, MMs would very quickly make a big buck.

They wouldn't have the same fear as when UST lost its peg — precisely because it has a different design"
5007,2022-05-20 13:49:45+00:00,Timccopeland,Yet Tether has no such mechanism. It's a collateralized stablecoin. (and yes you can dispute its collateral but that doesn't mean it works the same way)
5008,2022-05-20 13:49:45+00:00,Timccopeland,"this article specifically mentions 'price spirals' 

In UST's case, it's specific design caused a price spiral (as it's supply grew exponentially, causing its price to go to zero)"
5009,2022-05-20 13:49:44+00:00,Timccopeland,"the designs of usdt and ust are completely different

they're not really comparable at all IMO"

5051,2022-05-18 14:28:01+00:00,Timccopeland,this is also why we didn't cover this on the block.

5055,2022-05-18 13:51:14+00:00,Timccopeland,seems to be a huge disconnect between the terra community and the validators who are voting on their behalf

- Terra community seems to be against the proposal. Will they now vote against it?

Perhaps Gmail should bring out its own gated email service. It would instantly have people ready to use it."
5719,2022-04-15 20:45:23+00:00,Timccopeland,"@Ethan_Lou Not according to our recent communications training, which shows the many ways email is actually much better to use than slack for certain uses.

5740,2022-04-15 14:27:33+00:00,Timccopeland,i also have a simpler domain name to use but can't connect it to wp without paying the $180
5741,2022-04-15 14:26:41+00:00,Timccopeland,"wish i could code and create a better one, or if wp brought back its plans and i could use proper rss widgets without spending a few hundred quid but hey ho"
5742,2022-04-15 14:25:38+00:00,Timccopeland,"in my quest to find/create a basic and easy to read feed for just core crypto news sites, i created this. it's super basic but feel free to use. 

(it would have been better if wordpress hadn't abandoned its pricing plans - so only using free widgets)

But if you want to share the facts, pls retweet the first tweet."
6567,2022-03-04 10:03:36+00:00,Timccopeland,"There were also reports of OpenSea banning some users in certain jurisdictions. 

The site confirmed ""OpenSea blocks users and territories on the U.S. sanctions list from using our services"""
6568,2022-03-04 10:03:35+00:00,Timccopeland,"For those that don't know, MetaMask is a wallet and Infura provides Ethereum infrastructure. Basically the MetaMask uses Infura to access the blockchain. 

But you can set MetaMask to point to other nodes — even your own one, if you don't want to trust or rely on anybody else."
6569,2022-03-04 10:03:35+00:00,Timccopeland,"So let me summarise:

Infura: restricts access to sanctioned countries

MetaMask: doesn't restrict because it's client-side software (but stays compliant)"
6570,2022-03-04 10:03:35+00:00,Timccopeland,"So what happened yesterday? Well by default MetaMask uses Infura, a centralized service that does block access to some users in some jurisdictions.

In this case, Infura accidentally blocked too many people by default and then had to fix this."
6571,2022-03-04 10:03:35+00:00,Timccopeland,"Official comment from MetaMask:

""...client-side software like browsers and wallets are not able to know what country a user is located in because it is client-side software running on the users device"""

their math was off by 15% (making them erroneously think the vote was much more in Brantley's favor) — which is all I was pointing out."
6588,2022-03-03 20:56:16+00:00,Timccopeland,"@zackseward The author also mistakenly assumed that you would need to get 50% of tokens voting for, including the abstentions, rather than a simple majority (per DMs)

That's why he figured it was a sure thing when it was a lot closer than he realised."
6589,2022-03-03 20:53:48+00:00,Timccopeland,"@zackseward Fwiw it went to like 48% - 52%, was very close and showed that it was a mistake for the author to write that it was basically a sure thing.

But you're right, I can't predict the future. My point was that it was very open and wasn't set in stone at that time."

6689,2022-02-24 11:49:35+00:00,Timccopeland,"so did the FT get this direct from Chainalysis? I would just love to know how the number was derived and if it excludes anything. 

@MsHannahMurphy can you help?"
6690,2022-02-24 11:49:35+00:00,Timccopeland,"what's odd is i can't seem to find this stat. The FT references another article, which references another FT article which has this stat in it. It seems to come out just after Chainalysis' annual NFT report — but the report doesn't seem to have the stat either."
6691,2022-02-24 11:42:28+00:00,Timccopeland,"what's also odd is Axie Infinity has 3 million daily users who all need NFTs to play the game. (and sure there are scholarships). 

so how does Chainalysis come out to just 300K?"
6692,2022-02-24 11:40:03+00:00,Timccopeland,"i mean for a start adding 220K users on solana in last 30 days might help. Will be even higher over last year. then add cardano, tezos etc etc"

6699,2022-02-23 16:11:15+00:00,Timccopeland,"@corintxt pseudonymity created bitcoin, which started all of this. feels odd to say it's a bad thing, because some bad people hide behind it.

it's like saying internet is bad because you can do bad things with it. pseudonymity allows for more and faster innovation"
6700,2022-02-23 16:05:17+00:00,Timccopeland,@joonian if he's a convicted felon then that's clearly justified to report - it's clearly in the public interest to reveal those details
6701,2022-02-23 15:59:58+00:00,Timccopeland,"@joonian a project where the pseudonymity of the founders was part of its whole shtick. I'd argue the public interest was against it — hence the massive backlash

and their argument ""oh but they could have been evil criminals even though they weren't"" was weak IMO"
6702,2022-02-23 15:56:40+00:00,Timccopeland,"@corintxt i don't think it's doxxing i just don't think it was really justified to break their pseudoanonymity. it's not a company like Apple, just a required legal entity — it's more like uncovering Banksy for clicks."
6703,2022-02-23 15:51:16+00:00,Timccopeland,"@joonian my point is that writing a story and revealing personal information is justified when it is in the 'public interest' and that if they did a massive crime, that then meets the quota."
6704,2022-02-23 15:50:08+00:00,Timccopeland,@joonian you're saying decrypt mistrusts journalists in general? that's just incorrect
6705,2022-02-23 15:46:19+00:00,Timccopeland,"oh and the latest sign of 'mistrust' between companies and journalists, is a crypto media company rescinding invitations to its own event. 

so like the crypto media mistrusts itself? lol https://t.co/xqqAoDzjUg"

6982,2022-02-07 09:56:59+00:00,Timccopeland,just turned this into a thread on my thoughts on the situation
6983,2022-02-07 09:55:56+00:00,Timccopeland,"but this is where i get back to the point of it as 'unncessary journalism'

just because something exists on the internet doesn't necessarily mean you should find it and share it — even if you're a journalist."
6984,2022-02-07 09:55:56+00:00,Timccopeland,and to some degree they have a point that if the founders wanted true anonymity they shouldn't have set up a company in their own names.
6985,2022-02-07 09:55:56+00:00,Timccopeland,the final facet comes down to the fact that these journalists 'could' find out the names of the founders. i.e. that it was publicly available. (this is similar to that NYT story about Slate Star)
6986,2022-02-07 09:55:55+00:00,Timccopeland,"this is similar to bitcoin in some way. if someone were to doxx the founder of bitcoin that would put them at risk in so many ways and *potentially* harm the progression of the network. 

many in crypto would fight to keep satoshi anonymous."
6987,2022-02-07 09:55:55+00:00,Timccopeland,"and the anonymity was baked in from the beginning. when the collection was minted, nobody said 'hey what a minute i'm not buying these JPEGs if i don't know who's selling them' 

it was a wholly accepted part of the deal. and many likely didn't even want to know the founders."
6988,2022-02-07 09:55:55+00:00,Timccopeland,"the only argument is that bored apes has become a big thing worth a lot of money. 

but this isn't Apple. it's not a publicly listed company. it's a community-driven project, arguably run in many ways by the community, not the founders."
6989,2022-02-07 09:55:55+00:00,Timccopeland,"but in the case of bored apes, there has been no such bad activity (that anyone is aware of) in order to justify such intrusion. 

and so, in the original article, there was no justification given for a clear public interest argument"
6990,2022-02-07 09:55:54+00:00,Timccopeland,this is clear in the case where there's misconduct. if someone has acted illegally and (e.g. had a ton of parties while telling the country to be in strict lockdown) then there's a huge need to expose that hypocrisy.
6991,2022-02-07 09:55:54+00:00,Timccopeland,but 'public interest' is a vague term. it sounds like it's just about how many people are 'interested' in it. Rather it's more about whether it serves the progression of society in a positive manner if the details are revealed.
6992,2022-02-07 09:55:54+00:00,Timccopeland,"i guess my view is that it's 'unnecessary journalism'. 

like the purpose of journalism isn't to uncover every fact in the world necessarily (people have private lives) but to find the truth, particularly where there has been deceit — and where there's public interest in it"

7758,2021-12-27 15:49:35+00:00,Timccopeland,@Kristian_Kho Cheers buddy. I think that shows the both of us spend all our time on Twitter 😅
7759,2021-12-27 15:27:57+00:00,Timccopeland,This thread goes into some thoughts about my transition to the block and what I'm going to be doing. Bit vague but kinda directional.
7760,2021-12-27 15:25:16+00:00,Timccopeland,"But either way, imma keep on writing. 

Because someone has to document this wild explosion of new technology and it might as well be me."
7761,2021-12-27 15:25:16+00:00,Timccopeland,"But it's going to get interesting. The Block is changing and has some fun plans. 

And maybe I'll step back into a leadership role then and help build out new products."
7762,2021-12-27 15:25:15+00:00,Timccopeland,"So right now I'm mainly just writing and editing. 

I've done a ton of features already at the block, some of my best work I've ever done. They've also brought in a lot of subs too. 

Plus editing the team and hiring (brought on Osato earlier this year)."
7763,2021-12-27 15:25:15+00:00,Timccopeland,"The question is what product am I building at The Block. 

Well it's quite different. Different audience, different branding, different monetization model. And it's much bigger, I'm 1 of 100, rather than 1 of 10."
7764,2021-12-27 15:25:14+00:00,Timccopeland,"Sometimes it doesn't feel like news is a product that's being built and I feel like I'm left out of those building cool crypto stuff (just observing). But I think news is just a different kind of product. 

And I helped build a traffic driver at decrypt."
7765,2021-12-27 15:25:14+00:00,Timccopeland,"And it's just another sign that crypto is where it's at. To build a website and to suddenly reach this kind of audience and awareness within a few years is pretty impressive. 

Every builder in this space has so much potential on their hands."
7766,2021-12-27 15:15:28+00:00,Timccopeland,"And yeah this is a dumb metric of success but it's just a cool one for me to just come across when scrolling YouTube. 

But what it shows it how it has become a household name as it were (within crypto)."
7767,2021-12-27 15:13:20+00:00,Timccopeland,"Hm my brain keeps telling me this may have happened before. Maybe it has, I dunno, but this was the first time I came across it organically."

7850,2021-12-22 11:53:05+00:00,Timccopeland,"according to zhu su, if prices go up you should buy more and if prices go down you should buy more"
7851,2021-12-22 09:29:54+00:00,Timccopeland,This is a joke Reddit comment but please tell me Walmart doesn't actually have a ring machine? https://t.co/H778GF2IaS
7852,2021-12-22 09:20:20+00:00,Timccopeland,Shiba girlfriend? That's a token?
7853,2021-12-21 23:54:50+00:00,Timccopeland,"So I guess my suggestion would be, think less about dismissing NFTs because 'you don't own the picture' and consider what you will be able to do with transferable digital items in the future.

Platforms of the future will be designed with NFTs as the starting point.

/fin"
7854,2021-12-21 23:54:49+00:00,Timccopeland,"And you could even get more bizarre stuff. You could tokenize your own Axie NFT, split it up into millions of parts and sell those fractions (perhaps at a higher valuation)."
7855,2021-12-21 23:54:49+00:00,Timccopeland,"And sure, the game is centralized and could just have these axies without NFTs.

But because they are NFTs, someone who owns axies can send them to anyone else around the world. They can keep them in their own digital wallet."
7856,2021-12-21 23:54:49+00:00,Timccopeland,"While that's far away, here's an example right now. 

In the game Axie Infinity, players own their in-game characters, which are NFTs."
7857,2021-12-21 23:54:48+00:00,Timccopeland,"This is where it gets interesting. As we move toward a digital world with digital ownership, people will want to own digital items. But they will want items that are unique/not generic."
7858,2021-12-21 23:54:48+00:00,Timccopeland,"The reason they were created was to create tokens that were (unlike most tokens) non-fungible. So each token in the collection could be uniquely identified. 

And each token could have different properties."
7859,2021-12-21 23:54:47+00:00,Timccopeland,"But anyway, I think one way to look beyond this is to understand that there aren't only PFP NFTs. 

NFTs are more specifically unique digital tokens. They can include metadata like text or links to images."
7860,2021-12-21 23:54:47+00:00,Timccopeland,Perhaps that can be solved through technology. I reckon so. (What if the new purchases automatically creates a signed agreement with the token creator?)
7861,2021-12-21 23:54:45+00:00,Timccopeland,"While I do think there are some cases that argue against this (look at bored ape holders monetizing their IP), there remains a legal question over whether transferring an NFT can transfer the ownership to a new party (without a contract)."
7862,2021-12-21 23:54:44+00:00,Timccopeland,"When it comes to 1, I think it's the most valid point and biggest hurdle for NFTs. Do you own the image?

I alluded to this when I wrote about NFTs as the birth of the virtual economy. My point was that they're an early version of what's to come."
7863,2021-12-21 23:54:44+00:00,Timccopeland,"As for 2, this will be solved when Ethereum goes to proof of stake. There's little discussion there. 

For 3, it's certainly possible but tbh I'd be surprised if it was that common. Kinda hard to do on a public blockchain, especially with unique tokens."
7864,2021-12-21 23:54:42+00:00,Timccopeland,"Just read through an entire Reddit comments section on NFTs and it seems the criticisms come down to three things:

1. Ownership
2. Environment
3. Money laundering."

https://t.co/huKla9tTiO"
8124,2021-12-10 14:01:45+00:00,Timccopeland,"9/ Basically it's a huge business, these firms are practically printing money and there's not a lot of competition right now.

But it's quite a different business to mining and you need to accomodate that. Plus, revenue depends on prices staying high ofc."
8125,2021-12-10 14:01:44+00:00,Timccopeland,"8/ The biggest staking firms are now in the same league as the biggest bitcoin mining pools (best comparison).

And they're not far off from the biggest bitcoin mining companies (that mine their own coins)."
8126,2021-12-10 14:01:44+00:00,Timccopeland,7/ Figment's Clayton Menzel says that it’s currently seeing around $10 million in revenue per month at current prices — estimating about $100 million for this year.
8127,2021-12-10 14:01:43+00:00,Timccopeland,"6/ As a result, this has made staking a very profitable business. If the price goes up 12,900%, the staking firm's revenue goes up by the same amount (minus increased competition)

Plus if more people want to stake due to the rising prices, revenues could shoot up even faster."
8128,2021-12-10 14:01:43+00:00,Timccopeland,"5/ Over this year, money has flooded into proof of stake blockchains. Solana (SOL) is up 12,900%, fantom (FTM) is up 12,300% and many more. https://t.co/bjhYSsKw1i"
8129,2021-12-10 14:01:41+00:00,Timccopeland,"4/ Staking and staking companies have been around a while now. Some of the bigger ones operate on &gt;20 blockchains.

But it wasn't all that profitable until recently."
8130,2021-12-10 14:01:41+00:00,Timccopeland,"3/ While Bitcoin and Ethereum are on proof of work, most newer blockchains use proof of stake. Plus, Ethereum is shifting to it, perhaps as early as next year.

There is debate over which method is more secure but that's beyond the scope of this thread."
8131,2021-12-10 14:01:41+00:00,Timccopeland,"2/ What is staking?

Proof of stake is an alternative consensus mechanism where validators lock up funds and produce blocks. If they act maliciously, they can lose their funds. When they lock up their funds, it's known as staking and they recieve a staking reward."

8837,2021-11-09 11:47:21+00:00,Timccopeland,a lot of sites covered the brave/solana partnership but i still don't see it actually doing much. i.e. you can just use phantom on brave already. Plus defaulting to solana for cross-chain swaps doesn't make much sense - surely you want to swap from the network you're using?

9893,2021-10-05 09:47:46+00:00,Timccopeland,"7/ Instead, it can be really good to develop your niche. For me, that's writing about crypto tech. For others it might be knowing everything there is to know about defi lending/borrowing. Or perhaps be an expert in Cardano NFTs! 

Whatever it is, find your scope, and flourish."
9894,2021-10-05 09:47:46+00:00,Timccopeland,"6/ And that's where scope comes in. 

It's okay not to know everything about all things crypto. It's okay to miss things, to miss out on opportunities, to not get airdrops. To not see all the news or all the drama. It's okay."
9895,2021-10-05 09:47:46+00:00,Timccopeland,"5/ Why do I bring this up? 

Well the crypto space can be very overwhelming at times. 1000s of cryptos, 100s of defi protocols, 1000s of NFT launches. It can feel like you're a fish that wants to explore the whole ocean, which is growing by miles every day"
9896,2021-10-05 09:47:45+00:00,Timccopeland,"4/ I've found this essential in managing features in particular. Sometimes i've gone overboard and sunk months into a story (arguably justified) but through that I learned where to draw the line.

And it means I can keep knocking out features much more regularly."
9897,2021-10-05 09:47:45+00:00,Timccopeland,"3/ its purpose is to make sure your goals are manageable

you might have an idea to research and write about the top 100 cryptos but you'll never make it. But if you focus on just one, it's much more achievable."
9898,2021-10-05 09:47:45+00:00,Timccopeland,2/ in the journalism world this means choosing the boundary that your story is about and staying within it.

11304,2021-07-05 13:41:35+00:00,Timccopeland,must be a slow news day https://t.co/M26nUC7ziV
11305,2021-07-05 11:58:22+00:00,Timccopeland,"@CyphrETH @ColdBloodShill Yep, it wasn't that commonly used though until Prince Andrew brought the term back in fashion"
11306,2021-07-05 11:56:09+00:00,Timccopeland,@Fullbeerbottle Possibly one of my favourite crypto moments ever.
11307,2021-07-05 10:28:33+00:00,Timccopeland,"sorry for the rant, just a few thoughts"
11308,2021-07-05 10:28:33+00:00,Timccopeland,"There's also a distinction between having money a central bank can't issue and having it not work with the financial system.

Many crypto people want to integrate crypto with the financial system. Even DeFi platforms are adding support for institutional investors."
11309,2021-07-05 10:28:33+00:00,Timccopeland,"""The traceless currency leaves a trail after all.""

Bitcoin isn't traceless. It's less anonymous than cash. Everything is *literally* on a public ledger.

It was the media that portrayed it as a tool for criminals."
11310,2021-07-05 10:28:32+00:00,Timccopeland,"And even these issues are well known and being actively worked on — dividing people into those that think they will get solved/want to solve them and those that think the problems are insurmountable.

But the problems raised in this piece are so banal."
11311,2021-07-05 10:28:32+00:00,Timccopeland,"Like there are plenty of valid criticisms. challenge between miners/nodes for updating network, scalability issues for lightning network, whether fees will replace mining rewards (and what does that mean for opening lightning channels)"
11312,2021-07-05 10:28:32+00:00,Timccopeland,"I just struggle to see the magic leap from the premises to the conclusions.

Stablecoins and CBDCs exist so bitcoin is failing. 🙃

11314,2021-07-05 08:20:02+00:00,Timccopeland,"@crypto_fruit yeah that's what i mean. but looking at the graph, the debt is growing much faster than the size of the deficit."
11315,2021-07-05 07:55:16+00:00,Timccopeland,@crypto_fruit how does the debt grow by more than the deficit? is that just interest?
11316,2021-07-05 07:53:46+00:00,Timccopeland,"@crypto_fruit jeez, so maybe it's backed by debt 🤣"

11323,2021-07-04 11:33:48+00:00,Timccopeland,"I have since received further confirmation that the Cayman Islands entity isn't the main one used for business/exchange purposes. 

(Although it has been used to register Binance trademarks and to sue Forbes)"
11324,2021-07-04 11:33:47+00:00,Timccopeland,The main clarification is that this offshore company isn't really Binance's headquarters. The documents do state 'headquarters' but I believe that refers to the structure of the Cayman entities—not speaking for the whole company.
11325,2021-07-04 11:33:47+00:00,Timccopeland,"PSA: I now believe this article is innacurate.

But it gives so much control to governments, i mean especially with china, it's concerning.

We're going to miss the true privacy coin fiat money!"
11341,2021-07-02 12:55:34+00:00,Timccopeland,@joonian @sytaylor yeah that example was a little much but i was trying to illustrate the point in a relatable way
11342,2021-07-02 12:43:24+00:00,Timccopeland,"@joonian @sytaylor at the moment sure. but if they can literally code all the money that's being used in the country from their party HQ, I feel like that would easily be very effective. 

Obvs right now it's hard to control cash and they have a big shadow banking problem. But this might fix it."
11343,2021-07-02 12:42:02+00:00,Timccopeland,"This is a stupid example but what if it decided you were a little overweight and made it so you could only spend your cash at salad bars and banned you from buying hamburgers?

I doubt it would end up being something like that, but i'm trying to give a way to picture it."
11344,2021-07-02 12:40:49+00:00,Timccopeland,"Obviously this tech is great for customising and could have fantastic use cases. 

However, the concern is that China (which already has a points system for its citizens) might literally code your money so you can only use it in limited ways."
11345,2021-07-02 12:39:16+00:00,Timccopeland,@ZzObbb @loomdart the point is that they might say you can only buy these things and literally code it so you can't spend money on e.g. buying crypto or some other thing you might want to do that they don't like.
11346,2021-07-02 12:37:52+00:00,Timccopeland,"@sytaylor Oh of course this kind of customisation could be used in great ways — but China already has a points system for citizens, let alone controlling everything they do with their money.

DCEP will become the currency used within alipay. I don't believe there will be 'competition'."

Hence why it's more ironic for NFTs than blockchains."

With NFTs, you could mint a billion in one go, depending on the blockchain platform. Some constraints too, but more indirect."

12738,2021-03-17 20:38:30+00:00,Timccopeland,"@BradyDale Surely it does for other sites to show you your NFT, like NFT wallets"
12739,2021-03-17 20:33:58+00:00,Timccopeland,@BradyDale Could you use decentralized file storage like filecoin?
12740,2021-03-17 20:33:24+00:00,Timccopeland,@spencecoin @sabroshi1 Oh I assumed it was. I have no idea.
12741,2021-03-17 20:32:30+00:00,Timccopeland,"@Kevtricky @LifeInnovation5 @michael_saylor Basically miners use electricity to mine Ethereum. This creates new blocks in the chain and keeps it going.

As long as the chain continues to grow, you can use any of Ethereum's features without requiring more mining to be done. 

This is why NFTs don't add more energy cost."
12742,2021-03-17 20:29:53+00:00,Timccopeland,"@sabroshi1 @spencecoin Yep totally, I was on a podcast with @andrarchy recently where we discussed how they are exploding outwards and breaking new ground but that it might run out of fuel."

12746,2021-03-17 19:17:07+00:00,Timccopeland,Whuut
12747,2021-03-17 17:07:33+00:00,Timccopeland,Lol apart from memes I'm weirdly suited to this
12748,2021-03-17 17:04:56+00:00,Timccopeland,"It's very popular to say NFTs are killing the environment. 

Here's a thread on why that's a bit misleading."
12749,2021-03-17 17:01:47+00:00,Timccopeland,🔥🔥
12750,2021-03-17 17:01:14+00:00,Timccopeland,"Critics of Ethereum's impact on the environment must be excited by its move to proof of stake, where its impact will be reduced. 

Perhaps this discussion will lead them to following its technological progress."
12751,2021-03-17 17:01:13+00:00,Timccopeland,"So in short, Ethereum's impact on the environment is happening anyway. Minting NFTs doesn't make it worse. 

The only thing is that by minting NFTs you might be endorsing Ethereum, which you might already disagree with over environment concerns. But that's not to do with the NFTs"
12752,2021-03-17 17:01:13+00:00,Timccopeland,"And the specific idea that, as the blockchain gets longer/bigger, it needs more hashpower—that's just not true.

Hashpower is based on economic incentives. If prices go up, that might encourage a higher hashrate."
12753,2021-03-17 17:01:13+00:00,Timccopeland,"If you mint millions of NFTs, all that does is increase transaction costs for everyone else. 

It doesn't require or directly lead to any increase in hashpower/environmental damage."
12754,2021-03-17 17:01:12+00:00,Timccopeland,"But it doesn't matter how many transactions or mints or smart contracts calls are in the blocks. Sure miners want to get some fees, but they mostly do it for the mining rewards."
12755,2021-03-17 17:01:12+00:00,Timccopeland,"Ethereum blocks are set to be mined on schedule, around every 14 seconds. The mining difficulty changes to accommodate changes in mining hashpower, in order to keep the blocks coming out on schedule."
12756,2021-03-17 17:01:11+00:00,Timccopeland,"What's confused me recently is that few cared about the environmental impact of Ethereum mining...until NFTs came about. Then suddenly, every NFT you make is killing the environment. 

But I think that is based on a misconception."
12757,2021-03-17 17:01:11+00:00,Timccopeland,"""As the blockchain grows over time, so does the overall level of work that needs to be performed to keep it going...""

I think this is the root of a lot of confusion.

And Ethereum mining uses less electricity than Bitcoin mining (lower hashrate), so it would be a smaller bar chart than all three."

13223,2021-02-20 10:37:10+00:00,Timccopeland,"@Frances_Coppola @EdKwangl Lightning scales on a fundamental level because it enables value transfer as easily as moving information with no increased PoW cost. 

The challenges are on opening/closing channels and mitigating disputes. Those are elements that need improving, but are not fundamental issues."
13224,2021-02-20 10:35:56+00:00,Timccopeland,"@Frances_Coppola @EdKwangl It has challenges, there's certainly a lot of work to be done to enable it to scale. Batching for channel opening will be a start. 

It's going to be exciting to watch it develop and grow.

Last weekend I was creating lightning facuets that could be sent out on a mailing list, with a unique faucet for each reader. It was super easy and effective.

LMK if you want to try the tech"
13227,2021-02-20 10:24:42+00:00,Timccopeland,"@Frances_Coppola @zharvz @EdKwangl @jemimajoanna Okay so I disagree with your base assumption. The bitcoin ecosystem would be smaller, sure, but that wouldn't kill the Bitcoin network.

With e.g. Umbrel, it's now super easy for anyone to run a node and many more are doing so. It's exciting to see."

Surely that deliberately misses the point of what he was saying?"
13230,2021-02-20 10:15:01+00:00,Timccopeland,"@EdKwangl @Frances_Coppola I believe there would always be people willing to swap cash/items for it. (Either local Bitcoins style or through access to the entire internet)

13412,2021-02-16 11:14:42+00:00,Timccopeland,I'm curious why I've set up a new wallet on the Samourai app. Why can't it use the Umbrel Bitcoin wallet? Is it so it can interact with Whirlpool etc?
13413,2021-02-16 11:07:48+00:00,Timccopeland,actually i'm not sure this is the right intepretation. will start using it to find out
13414,2021-02-16 11:02:40+00:00,Timccopeland,"Can someone explain what this is? Or at least, why you would buy someone's tokens?

I'm looking at the docs and token holders don't seem to get anything."
13415,2021-02-16 10:58:16+00:00,Timccopeland,"okay so the best thing about trying this stuff out is it teaches you so much. 

e.g. the end goal: ""Congratulations! Whirlpool is now mixing your UTXOs on your Umbrel!""

So i think this means, any time I send a tx, it will be mixed/more private. (plus everything is via Tor)"
13416,2021-02-16 10:47:02+00:00,Timccopeland,@heynky surely i need to know how many bytes the channel opening will cost - but i can't seem to see that
13417,2021-02-16 10:46:34+00:00,Timccopeland,@heynky so that's what I'm using! But I don't know how to compare my Lightning channel fee with the sat/vB it uses

When comparing interest rates, make sure to check the conditions for those rates. Some companies have higher rates if you either a) hold a load of their tokens or b) agree to receive interest in their tokens.

I would guess that they still have the funds, and since there's a lawsuit, probably will hold them until that's resolved. But you'd have to ask them, or those involved in the lawsuit."
16066,2020-08-18 17:31:08+00:00,Timccopeland,17/ Well that was it folks. The story of Steem and its epic battle with Justin Sun. It doesn't get more crypto than this.
16067,2020-08-18 17:31:08+00:00,Timccopeland,16/ Another deleted scene: Sun offered to sell the ninjamined stake to Hensley and Notestein during the voting war. They both declined.
16068,2020-08-18 17:31:07+00:00,Timccopeland,"15/ The resolve. Those who loved Steem are now building their dream that they were never able to build on Steem. 

Steem has became largely used by the Korean community who supported Sun (over a downvote issue). He continues with his crypto empire."
16069,2020-08-18 17:31:07+00:00,Timccopeland,"14/ After this, some original Steem witnesses served Bittrex with a lawsuit to try to get their funds back. I don't think this has been otherwise reported.

Imagine the lawyers trying to get their heads around this story. Just imagine."
16070,2020-08-18 17:31:06+00:00,Timccopeland,"13/ Then a sudden twist. The money saved!? A Robin Hood? A vigilante hacker? It's wild. 

I love Hensley's 'holy shit' quote on this. Sums it up nicely."
16071,2020-08-18 17:31:06+00:00,Timccopeland,"12/ But back on Steem, things got tough. Money was frozen, then seized. Witnesses were powering down, trying to escape to Hive (another intricate part of the story) but caught on the way. 

Imagine being Hensley and watching the clock count down until your money disappears. Poof."
16072,2020-08-18 17:31:06+00:00,Timccopeland,"11/ Splinterlands would be a deleted scene. Steem's biggest dapp had customers on both sides and was late to switch to Hive. When it did, it took a lot of momentum with it."
16073,2020-08-18 17:31:05+00:00,Timccopeland,"10/ Then it came to Hive. I loved the parallel between its origins in Notestein's basement and the new chain being later developed in the same place. Some poetic symmetry there.

- It must be said the Hive community was much bigger than Notestein and Hensley. Had to simplify."
16074,2020-08-18 17:31:05+00:00,Timccopeland,"9/ The voting war was super interesting. A war, on the blockchain!? It was basically an arm wrestle between Sun and the community—one where you have to keep funding it to stay in the game.

Thought this was fascinating. Could have written more on it. - Sun won this round."
16075,2020-08-18 17:31:04+00:00,Timccopeland,"8/ But once that happened, Sun worked with exchanges to get his money back. He didn't tell them it was his funds, according to Huobi VP. 

This was what really got everyone mad. And kickstarted the ugliness."
16076,2020-08-18 17:31:04+00:00,Timccopeland,"7/ One question is: Who started it? Did Sun make the first move by buying Steemit quietly. Or did the Steem witnesses make the first move by freezing his funds?

This is certainly open to debate."
16077,2020-08-18 17:31:03+00:00,Timccopeland,"6/ Sun got Scott to agree that he could hold 30% of the money for Steemit back until after the migration was complete.

This shows how this was an integral part of his plan."
16078,2020-08-18 17:31:03+00:00,Timccopeland,"5/ So, Sun's entrepreneurial idea of bringing Steem to Tron (which could have made Steemit much bigger) was flawed *because* of the misunderstanding about the stake. 

Although there were also technical issues that might have also stood in the way of a migration."
16079,2020-08-18 17:31:03+00:00,Timccopeland,"4/ The key problem is that Sun was never contractually obliged to not sell the ninjamined stake. He was likely unaware of its controversial history.

There were vague promises that the stake would be decentralized/used for marketing. But nothing was put on Sun."
16080,2020-08-18 17:31:02+00:00,Timccopeland,"3/ What makes this story interesting? It's that the idea of Steem/Steemit is brilliant. Think Facebook, but making real money from posting content! It's addictive, it's powerful—but the execution was poor.

If I start using and spending more and more crypto per day, I think it would be reasonable to up the limit."
16531,2020-07-08 08:08:31+00:00,Timccopeland,"@jespow The spirit of the editor's code is that you don't write about something that you are invested in. It refers to stocks but I believe it applies to crypto too.

Come take a look: https://t.co/f0dtVvCHvN"
17827,2020-03-19 12:38:18+00:00,Timccopeland,"- A blockchain is the kind of thing you want to speak about if you want a date to end badly.
- It's like a database, but bigger.
- If you use the words ""blockchain bitcoin scalability crypto fiat proof-of-work"" you will sound knowledgable about it."
17828,2020-03-19 12:38:18+00:00,Timccopeland,"- Tron CEO Justin Sun is plugged into twitter where he subsists on retweets and likes.
- He will use anything to promote Tron, whether that's a picture with Kobe Bryant or calling his coin a shitcoin. 
- I interviewed him once in the Ritz, yes he's real."
17829,2020-03-19 12:38:18+00:00,Timccopeland,"- Every day Ripple partners with a new financial institution that you will have never heard of.
- The company owns nearly half of all XRP but denies having any control over it.
- They choose who's on the list of 'preferred validators' but deny controlling who runs the network."
17830,2020-03-19 12:38:17+00:00,Timccopeland,"- DeFi is a super complex, risky experiment that might be the future of finance or a way to lose all your money
- Eth 2 is an attempt to jam a v8 engine in the model T ford. Only 3 people understand how it will work
- Vitalik Buterin operates on a level above human understanding."
17831,2020-03-19 12:38:17+00:00,Timccopeland,"Exchanges are vital in crypto.
- Coinbase is run by Brian ""Bitcoin"" Armstrong.
- Binance isn't really located anywhere..
- By using any crypto exchange, you agree to at least 20% of your funds being hacked."
17832,2020-03-19 12:38:17+00:00,Timccopeland,"- Bitcoin SV is a cult based around Craig Wright, who's either Jesus, Satoshi Nakamoto, or neither.
- EOS is a blockchain run by 27 computers. Trust them at your peril. 
- Binance Coin is a surprise success story. You didn't think to invest in it but it beat your portfolio."
17833,2020-03-19 12:38:16+00:00,Timccopeland,"- Roger Ver will give you $10 of Bitcoin Cash. Always take money from strangers.
- Tether is everything. And you won't understand why until it's too late.
- Litecoin is great. It made Charlie Lee a fortune."
17834,2020-03-19 12:38:16+00:00,Timccopeland,"Here's what you need to know about crypto:

- Bitcoin is important, but you won't understand until you've flirted with some altcoins.
- Ethereum is like a complicated Bitcoin, you can do more but it's more risky.
- XRP is definitely not Ripple. But kind of is."

21941,2019-06-03 10:23:09+00:00,Timccopeland,@CryptOwenWilson It's entirely possible that a buyer could be well on their way to doing this—if the rumour is true. Many high net-worth individuals and family offices are stockpiling. The amount of money on exchanges is just a slice of the bitcoin in circulation.
21942,2019-06-03 09:35:52+00:00,Timccopeland,"@davidgerard @Crypto_Guppy So, guilty until proven innocent? This is where I leave the chat.."
21943,2019-06-03 09:35:05+00:00,Timccopeland,"@davidgerard @Crypto_Guppy Become a prosecutor. Take him to court. Prove it. Then convict him. 

Otherwise, you're accusing an innocent man of murder."
21944,2019-06-03 09:32:36+00:00,Timccopeland,"@davidgerard @Crypto_Guppy Wrong. Arguably silk road was terrible for bitcoin—it was the first real use case but it ruined the reputation of bitcoin. Other use-cases would have appeared in time. 

I still think everyone should get fair trials regardless of whether I am interested in cryptocurrencies."

21947,2019-06-03 09:27:28+00:00,Timccopeland,"@davidgerard I don't know. I've read the chat logs. And I've read about the number of corrupt officers that handled his case, stole money and could have altered the chat logs. 

I'm not the justice system. I think he should have a fair trial. That's it.

Saville is a very different case."
21948,2019-06-03 09:12:30+00:00,Timccopeland,"@davidgerard I'm saying he hasn't been convicted of ordering hits. And last time I checked, it's innocent until proven guilty. 

Would you want your sentence lengthened without being convicted of a further crime?"
21949,2019-06-03 08:54:24+00:00,Timccopeland,"@davidgerard He wasn't convicted on ordering hits on people. Those charges were dropped.
