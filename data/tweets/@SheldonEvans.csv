0,2023-02-21 07:13:36+00:00,SheldonEvans,@cillionaire_com Still just a bear rally imo. Higher than zero chance we test lows at least once more this year. Likely into the end of the year.
1,2023-02-21 06:53:49+00:00,SheldonEvans,"THoUgHts...

#ETH/#BTC looking quite precarious to me.

BTC testing 200W MA from below.

ETH reaching top of range ~1750-1790.

Perhaps we see an ETH ⬇️, and BTC ⬆️ approaching Shanghai Hard Fork (+ after as withdrawals happen)?

Most alts look as precarious against BTC rn too. https://t.co/i908KDRJwJ"
2,2023-02-20 13:58:50+00:00,SheldonEvans,"So if #Bitcoin breaks the 200WMA, what do you think is the narrative that pushes it higher? China?
...or the narrative that sends us back to the lows? Macro?

Seeing an equal amount of despair as I see hopium on my tl.

Like it or not, digital assets are entirely narrative-driven https://t.co/ZXeDoU7iTh"

5,2022-11-12 09:40:40+00:00,SheldonEvans,"@Web3DMD @IIIXIIIIIX I do agree with that, but it’s still not crypto’s “fault”. Bad actors with malicious intentions will always exist

8,2022-11-09 17:06:20+00:00,SheldonEvans,"I’m seeing a lot of “crypto is fucked, it’s over” tweets today.

PLEASE understand that a CENTRALIZED exchange is literally the antithesis crypto 🙅🏻‍♂️

Yes the financial shockwaves will be immense but at the end of the day, it’s not “crypto” that failed."
9,2022-11-09 11:02:18+00:00,SheldonEvans,Btw to add to this. This is ONLY looking at the situation from a crypto-isolated view and not taking into account the god awful macro environment that will compound this and send us to the underworld.

26,2022-09-25 16:50:55+00:00,SheldonEvans,"@justwalyd Exactly, kinda like when you travel and have to do a little mental arithmetic to convert to the local currency except this is at scale with much larger transactions and instead of buying streetfood, you’re buying jpegs worth thousands."
27,2022-09-25 16:49:00+00:00,SheldonEvans,@serwagmi1 Disagree with this sentiment. That’s not how you onboard millions of people. You need to make it as simple as possible.

30,2022-09-25 12:15:30+00:00,SheldonEvans,"@danku_r I personally don’t believe that as a currency, what we currently have beats fiat in terms of usability as a true form of money. Even the fact that eth is now less inflationary or potentially deflationary in the future makes it work less like money and more like an asset to hoard"
31,2022-09-25 12:13:37+00:00,SheldonEvans,@mbhdoteth Hmm. Interesting point. So you think the financial incentive has to be outsized compared to other markets to attract attention? Only problem with that is the attention leaves as fast as it arrives.
32,2022-09-25 12:12:03+00:00,SheldonEvans,@DrKingShultz1 I mean this kinda aligns with what I’m saying. I think even those who got wealthy with crypto maybe don’t even equate how much their eth translates to in the real world.
33,2022-09-25 10:51:15+00:00,SheldonEvans,"Imagine you went to Rolex and all the watches were priced in Tesla shares. 

Yes your crypto is not “shares” but you get the point. 

But until we primarily price our jpegs in usd or a less volatile currency, we’ll never see it become a long-term tradable market. 

Am I wrong?"
34,2022-09-25 10:51:14+00:00,SheldonEvans,"Thoughts? 🤔

NFTs (speculative assets) should not be priced in other speculative assets (ETH, SOL, etc). 

I do believe this is what helped garner the insane attention past bullrun since most humans are unable to easily determine value in their heads. 

Confusion fueled trading."

364,2021-12-28 13:57:59+00:00,SheldonEvans,@want_the_bag It’s a simple question mate. Definitely not expecting a lot of no’s.

2. An opportunity for smaller studios to swoop in and generate positive sentiment from the start. Be for the user and accommodate them, listen to them and iterate based on feedback."
431,2021-12-09 10:53:22+00:00,SheldonEvans,Gamers hating on NFTs I think has more to do with not being aware of the benefits they will receive too. Hate for mass corporations and major studios is one thing but following the herd and adding to the pushback shows how early we are and the studios that have high conviction…
432,2021-12-09 10:53:21+00:00,SheldonEvans,"Even though the studios will be rewarded and have a MASSIVE financial incentive to pursue this. The user benefits as well. 

Users already spend millions on in-game assets that THEY DO NOT OWN. Disposable non-transferable assets."
433,2021-12-09 10:53:21+00:00,SheldonEvans,"The insane pushback against the Ubisoft NFT announcement indicates two things. (Past sentiment towards Ubisoft ignored)
