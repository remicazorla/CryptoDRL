Warming is good for humans because crops grow better. More people die of cold than of heat.  Warming is also leading to greening of many desert regions, notably the Sahel."

2093,2022-05-25 22:56:51+00:00,McClellanOsc,@SergeyMagruk Okay. But it does not change the issue I raised about how to water the trees proposed for planting.
2094,2022-05-25 17:50:04+00:00,McClellanOsc,"@larryitis @CNBC That is generally not a problem. A landowner (like me) who clear cuts as a terminal harvest has a financial incentive to get it planted again ASAP. Here in WA State, it is also a harvest permitting requirement. I just had 4200 fir and cedar replanted on 13 clear cut acres."

More trees within cities would be great! Would help with ""urban heat island"" effect. But just throwing out big feel-good numbers does not help anything."

It is indeed a problem to have it converted to other purposes. US wildfires, esp. in Calif., are worse largely because of too many trees, i.e. not thinning for forest health. Planting won't solve that."
2098,2022-05-25 17:19:57+00:00,McClellanOsc,"@GregoryLMorris @CNBC In Pacific Northwest timberland, replanting is done at 300-400 stems per acre. Some of those new plants will die, and some others will sprout naturally. Terminal harvest (at 40-45 years) is ideally done at ~180 trees per acre. So thinning is needed to have a healthy forest."

7068,2019-12-06 19:38:10+00:00,McClellanOsc,"@probanker1 Yes I can. It is because the McClellan Oscillator is an end of day indicator, and your chart does not reflect today's data."
