- Price bottom != time bottom. Price can chop and grind for weeks/months after a low. If you can't stomach it, don't fish for it.

2954,2022-05-12 07:13:59+00:00,CryptoCred,"Random reminders

- Most vocal bears will lower their targets as price goes lower, meaning they never buy back.

- You don't have to buy the bottom, only to survive it.

- Wherever you think the bottom is, give yourself (at least) 10%-30% margin of error for a wick.

3893,2021-12-24 04:06:37+00:00,CryptoCred,"9. Be cynical about narratives. DeFi went from the only thing being traded to nobody caring. During NFT mania, couldn't find a single chart for weeks. Now it's just loss porn. Remember BTC U.S. session infinite bid? Me neither. 

When music (price+volume) is over, stop dancing."
3894,2021-12-24 04:06:37+00:00,CryptoCred,"8. In an uptrend, the best times to buy are either when it has already gone up (buy high to sell higher) or when it's forced lower (usually by a correlated market-wide pullback, often led by majors). Laggards, trendless coins, coins in 'accumulation' indefinitely = high opp cost."
3895,2021-12-24 04:06:37+00:00,CryptoCred,"7. If you're a trader, go to where the volume is. If that also happens to be a strong performer, as is often the case, you make life a lot easier. High volume usually means cleaner technicals. Ideally 1 week+/clear rotation bid (SOLUNAVAX-style) and not a one-off pump."
3896,2021-12-24 04:06:36+00:00,CryptoCred,"6. You're close to a local top when the only 'innovation' comes in the form of forks and clones. Seen it with DeFi, dog money, OHM, and so on. Same applies with dinosaur garbage coins pumping, which in itself is a form of anti-innovation. Good take profit signal, on average."
3897,2021-12-24 04:06:36+00:00,CryptoCred,"5. If you're looking for take profit signals, one thing I like to do is to add a couple of high time frame moving averages (Hull, some ribbon, 21W, 50W, whatever) and see how far away BTC is from those averages. Check where market is and ask: would I be happy to give back that %?"
3898,2021-12-24 04:06:36+00:00,CryptoCred,"4. You don't have to catch the top. The idea is to have made so much on the way up, that it ultimately doesn't matter when the nuke comes. And it'll always come. Voluntary sellers on the way up beat forced sellers on the way down."
3899,2021-12-24 04:06:35+00:00,CryptoCred,3. Outright top signals become less...outright as adoption increases. Shit has to scale e.g. in the past any celebrity talking about crypto was scary (e.g. Katy Perry nails) but in '21 it took Elon on SNL to nuke DOGE. Adjust accordingly.

Why? 

Because it increases my profits by 500%.

Example:  If you buy 1 Bitcoin for $10k and sell it at $50k, you make a profit of $40k. However, if you use 6x leverage, your profit increases to $240k.

Not a fan of fading this time frame unless invalidated. Price action at $10700 is good evidence of that.

Expecting a more rangebound environment for next month. Reasonably likely that $14k+ rally gets sold into.

11962,2020-07-30 12:01:25+00:00,CryptoCred,"When a market moves up really quickly, the move is often called ‚Äòinefficient‚Äô. 

My understanding of this is that if sellers step in: 

A) Bids are at lower prices / near structure 

B) Offside buyers more likely to exit aggressively 

This causes a ‚Äòcascade‚Äô / faster reversion."

Reasonable to sit out ahead of high time frame closes, but short-term plan remains unchanged. 

$10700 area is last reasonable support in this range. 

I‚Äôd get out of the way of bearish continuation or look to sell below there into $10300 area FTA.

1. If trading against HTF bias, intraday positions have a shorter shelf-life.

2. Shorter shelf-life = manage trades more aggressively.

3. If I'm playing for a bounce at a HTF level and it flips, I'm out ASAP. No questions.

Still within daily range ($8600-$10000).

Bias is towards $8600 given $9300 support broken.

Immediate support: $9060 (daily &amp; intraday).

Short-term idea: $9060 --&gt; $9300.

No good levels for me below $9060 until $8600, so short-term R:R favours buyers."

$6900 still an important daily level IMO.

If this is going to nuke, it has to hold as resistance.

Any intraday (certainly daily) acceptance above $6900 I think shorts get fried and we teleport to the top of the range at $7500-$7600.

A monthly close above support does not mean that price must instantly teleport higher.

The close simply sets a bias for the next candlestick.

A lot can happen in a month. 

If April is going to be bullish, that strength will form on weekly &amp; daily charts as well.

Opens often form at areas of traditional S/R hence why they ‚Äòwork‚Äô

I believe opens are most useful when looking for confluence and/or triggers for HTF ideas i.e. evidence of shifts in momentum and that the high/low of a given time period has likely formed"
13343,2020-03-30 06:21:51+00:00,CryptoCred,"@cryptunez Can also do stuff like anticipate volatility in certain areas (for similar reasons)

E.g. price trades below previous day‚Äôs low (PDL) at HTF support, aggressive selling gets nowhere &amp; PDL is reclaimed, you can develop entry triggers at/around dOpen as sellers get squeezed out"

E.g. price at HTF support, trades below it LTF &amp; sets a low, flips dOpen = evidence of low of day

$10k level that was broken support failed to provide resistance when retested.

This is usually evidence of a trap (bearish continuation sellers on the S/R flip caught offside).

HTF directional bias favours upside, clearing $10,460s (intraday range high) would cement that. https://t.co/dSFzeO64ks"

Technical: moved short stop down to -.1R. Price made a clear lower low &amp; broke support. If I‚Äôm right, the high of the candle that broke the level should hold.

15731,2019-08-20 19:58:44+00:00,CryptoCred,"@FiveThreeZer0 It‚Äôs certainly less of an issue, but still happens. 

Example: trade is going well and price is reasonably close to target without much/any structure in the way.

Also assume price hasn‚Äôt provided much structure to adjust stop. 

Tempting to close out early to feel safe."
15732,2019-08-20 19:53:10+00:00,CryptoCred,@ACXtrades @CryptoMessiah Yeah man most people choose the most random and arbitrary shit for entry/target/stop and management is usually even worse.
15733,2019-08-20 19:51:05+00:00,CryptoCred,"@CryptoMessiah @ACXtrades Totally understand. 

My point is a humble one: stop placement and management is as much a technical parameter (for technical traders) as entry and target. Accordingly, decisions regarding placement &amp; management should have a technical basis much like the other two. 

Simples."
15734,2019-08-20 19:47:53+00:00,CryptoCred,"@ACXtrades @CryptoMessiah Why does everyone seem to think that in 100% cases moving to break even is bad?

Not my argument at all!

I‚Äôm simply saying that for technical traders, decisions to move one‚Äôs stop should largely be based on technicals. 

Instead, it‚Äôs mostly done ASAP &amp; for psychological reasons"
15735,2019-08-20 19:44:32+00:00,CryptoCred,"@CryptoMessiah I have no idea where the word ‚Äòserial‚Äô came from, I‚Äôm sure you get the point haha."
15736,2019-08-20 19:43:41+00:00,CryptoCred,"@CryptoMessiah Never said there‚Äôs smth wrong with trailing stops, my argument is that stop placement (for a technical trader) should be based on technicals. 

That‚Äôs totally compatible with trailing stops. 

Just most people don‚Äôt do it that way &amp; instead try to serial ASAP/middle of nowhere."
15737,2019-08-20 19:41:15+00:00,CryptoCred,@cointradernik @CryptoMessiah Agreed! I think Messiah is essentially arguing the same thing by stating that the trade needs to have progressed far enough before making that decision.
15738,2019-08-20 19:39:58+00:00,CryptoCred,"@CryptoMessiah I disagree. 

If you‚Äôre trading a chart based on technicals then the position should be managed on technicals as well. Otherwise you‚Äôre just using your P&amp;L to justify management decisions, which I would argue has a net negative effect on one‚Äôs trading (over time)."
15739,2019-08-20 19:38:41+00:00,CryptoCred,"@CryptoMessiah @cointradernik Yes, doing it too early is a big part of it. 

But doing so without a technical basis/purely arbitrary can be harmful as well for reasons stated."
15740,2019-08-20 19:36:32+00:00,CryptoCred,@CryptoMessiah If the technicals don‚Äôt provide an argument for moving to break even then it‚Äôs an arbitrary decision that creates a risk of being stopped out prematurely/without being wrong.
15741,2019-08-20 19:27:23+00:00,CryptoCred,"@LomahCrypto Yes yes but I‚Äôd argue that those three areas are the hot spots for consistently fucking up management.

They‚Äôre also the most ‚Äòemotional‚Äô parts of a trade: feeling of losing money, feeling of securing a ‚Äòrisk-free trade‚Äô, and feeling of making money or making more than planned."

Let‚Äôs say we take your 5 trades per day figure and cut that by more than half, to 2 trades per day.

16264,2019-07-08 17:48:18+00:00,CryptoCred,"69. Ha, 69. Goteeeeem.

70. Always have a trade entry checklist. HTF premise, setup name, time frame, R:R, risk, trigger, target, and so on. Going over trades that you lost is so much easier when you know where to look as opposed to playing TA Sherlock Holmes."
16265,2019-07-08 17:48:18+00:00,CryptoCred,"68. Avoid doing too many hindsight exercises. The value of a setup is being able to identify it in real time. Unless you have a specific premise you're testing or idea you're exploring, 24/7 hindsight trading is nothing but a distraction. Mark up live charts instead."
16266,2019-07-08 17:48:18+00:00,CryptoCred,"67. Expectancy ((Win % x Average Win Size) ‚Äì (Loss % x Average Loss Size)) is hugely underrated. If you trade several setups/time frames, they all have different expectancy stats. With enough data, you can tailor your trading to risk more on better setups/less on weaker setups."
16267,2019-07-08 17:48:18+00:00,CryptoCred,"66. The size of the move is related to the time frame that the structure comes from. 

If you're selling an M15 trendline there's usually no reason to target a 300 pip drop.

If you're buying a D1 level, it's going to give more than 10 pips if you're right.

Tailor expectations."
16268,2019-07-08 17:48:17+00:00,CryptoCred,"65. Long-standing trends are quite hard to reverse. If the instrument you're monitoring on a Daily/Weekly is just shitting and has been on its arse for weeks/months, it's unlikely that an intraday higher high will mark the bottom. HTF trends require evidence of reversal on HTFs."
16269,2019-07-08 17:48:17+00:00,CryptoCred,"64. Price can turn on a dime. You might be a seller at a level and you see price absolutely fucking kamikaze pilot omegamoon green chadzooka ticks away from your level. That's very seldom a reason to pull your order. 

It's often the final FOMO leg before the reversal."
16270,2019-07-08 17:48:17+00:00,CryptoCred,63. Not every trade is a fixed 1R risk from the outset. You need to consider slippage risk. Trading a daily setup with a 40 pip stop as risk is NOT the same as trading an M5 rectangle on an exotic cross pair with a 5 pip stop ahead of news.
16271,2019-07-08 17:48:16+00:00,CryptoCred,"62. Price can remain overbought/oversold on whatever oscillator for ages. This is especially true in markets with strong trends where all you get is impulse into consolidation into continuation in the direction of the trend. 

Price leads the oscillator, not the other way round."
16272,2019-07-08 17:48:16+00:00,CryptoCred,"61. Price is rarely going to present a uniform picture across all time frames. E.g. if the D1 looks bearish &amp; retracing slightly, some lower time frame will (by definition) look bullish as price is going up.

Let the HTFs dictate bias &amp; use intraday time frames to act on it."
16273,2019-07-08 16:41:50+00:00,CryptoCred,"60. A+ levels act as 'magnets' for price. Just like markets like to probe swing points, previous days' highs/lows, 'liquidity', and so on, markets love to trade back to clear levels that jump out at speculators. Failure at those levels e.g. BTC 6k usually leads to huge moves."
16274,2019-07-08 16:41:50+00:00,CryptoCred,59. HTF levels require patience. If you were selling an M15 structure you probably wouldn't mind if it only shat 2-3 candles later. The same logic applies to a HTF chart: it's not always going to offer an immediate and violent reversal. Higher TF = more time to play out.
16275,2019-07-08 16:41:49+00:00,CryptoCred,"58. Stick to a handful of tools and structures for trading. Most technical stuff is buying where price rallies previously/selling where price fell previously, and then buying/selling the flip. Keep it simple. 

Too many diff. boxes/lines/indicators etc. = analysis paralysis."
16276,2019-07-08 16:41:49+00:00,CryptoCred,"57. Use sticky notes or some other visual reminder of important trade ideas/levels/biases/et cetera. For example, when a market breaks out it's easy for everyone to say they're buying dips. When the dip comes, very few remember their original idea. 

Make yourself accountable."
16277,2019-07-08 16:41:49+00:00,CryptoCred,"56. A chart is only as good as the actionable trade idea that it generates. Something might look ""clean"" and make you feel like you've got a really clear read, but unless you know which level(s) you're trading, what the trigger is, stop, and target, the chart is just 'art'."
16278,2019-07-08 16:41:49+00:00,CryptoCred,"55. Buy/Sell indicators are mostly bullshit. Very low probability that you find something that has been rigorously tested and just prints money like that. The best indicators are either i) textbook oscillator, MA etc. stuff used correctly; ii) confluence tools e.g. Gainzy's stuff"
16279,2019-07-08 16:41:48+00:00,CryptoCred,54. Stops losses are for i) fixing your risk; ii) reflecting new invalidation levels for an idea as price develops. They should be based on technicals (if a technical trader) and adjusted on technicals as well. No such thing as a free trade: BE stop = psychological cushion.
16280,2019-07-08 16:41:48+00:00,CryptoCred,"53. Price will often react immediately upon hitting HTF levels. Sometimes it'll shit straight away, but very often it'll retrace and retest the same level. It looks like a straight drop on D1/W1, but traders who use the first reaction to move their stop very often get chewed out."
16281,2019-07-08 16:41:48+00:00,CryptoCred,"51. You're not going to build a career by punting a BabyPips candlestick cheat sheet on random time frames.

52. Candlestick patterns work best when they're clear, simple, appear on HTFs, and where there's some follow through in the anticipated direction after they're formed."

50. Don't marry your original R:R."
16294,2019-07-07 16:53:55+00:00,CryptoCred,"47. Manage a trade on the same TF that you entered it. E.g. if it's a daily setup then wait for daily close(s) to manage. I've lost so much money puking HTF setups b/c of intraday noise.

48. In a D1 trade, intraday FTA is for management (rarely for closing the position)."
16295,2019-07-07 16:53:55+00:00,CryptoCred,"45. Some setups define the risk for you. Overthrow/overextension setups (over/under, tline overthrow, Quasifuckinmodo, range deviations, and so on) make stop placement logical and, more importantly, replicable.

46. You only need a couple of good setups for a trading career."
16296,2019-07-07 16:53:55+00:00,CryptoCred,"43. There's nothing wrong with demo as long as 1) you treat it seriously; 2) have plans/strict criteria for when you can 'graduate'.

44. A good alternative is funding an account with money you can afford to lose and just taking low % risk setups. Management experience is KEY."
16297,2019-07-07 16:53:55+00:00,CryptoCred,42. Trading a small account is nothing like trading a big account. Even in purely psychological terms: what's the likelihood that you're comfortable with several grand of risk taking the form of a market stop loss below some M15 rectangle on BitMEX?
16298,2019-07-07 16:35:03+00:00,CryptoCred,"40. If you're worried that your stop is too tight, it almost certainly is.

41. Don't bend the market to your R:R tool. It doesn't care. The market doesn't give a shit where your 0.1 dust Mex account has an order that, if filled, would make you $10. Trade the chart."
16299,2019-07-07 16:35:03+00:00,CryptoCred,"39. In a downtrend/presence of a bearish bias, resistance becomes stronger and support levels become weaker. In an uptrend/presence of a bullish bias, support becomes stronger and resistance levels become weaker. Levels don't exist in a vacuum. Context is crucial (again)."
16300,2019-07-07 16:35:03+00:00,CryptoCred,"38. Don't try to catch the impulse move. By the time it's impulsive, you're probably too late. Let the impulse set the directional preference and inform you whether to sell the subsequent rally/buy the subsequent dip."
16301,2019-07-07 16:35:03+00:00,CryptoCred,"36. Obsession over precision/tight stops/minimum drawdown etc. will bury you. 

37. If you're flexing your p&amp;l and how well the trade is going to your friends/colleagues/ex girlfriend, it's probably time to take some profit."
16302,2019-07-07 16:35:02+00:00,CryptoCred,"34. If you have a target and an invalidation, market entries outside of S/R are actually reasonable as long as you can take the heat/some drawdown.

35. Retracements don't have to be into a level of S/R, sometimes they're just a means of improving R:R on a momentum trade."
16303,2019-07-07 16:35:02+00:00,CryptoCred,"31. Instead of finding more winning trades, first ask yourself whether you can make more from the trades that you win already.

32. Never, fucking ever, move your stop loss in a way that increases your account risk.

33. Compounding is underused."
16304,2019-07-07 16:19:26+00:00,CryptoCred,"27. Most things that aren't already in your system or that can't be easily systematised are a distraction: funding, books, big market buys/sells, CME gaps, futs contango/backwardation, etc. Just stick to what you know and what you can track.

28. Most people don't have a clue."
16305,2019-07-07 16:19:26+00:00,CryptoCred,"25. Most people will have the same levels as you. Yet very few make money. Focus on what separates the two groups: entry triggers, stop placement, trade management, risk management, etc.

26. Knowing when to avoid a level is just as important as knowing when to trade one."
16306,2019-07-07 16:19:26+00:00,CryptoCred,"24. If you're some price action prodigy trading 14 different types of market structure setups SFP rectangles and shitting money, you're probably better off punting an automated moving average crossover strategy."
16307,2019-07-07 16:19:25+00:00,CryptoCred,"22. If you're getting chopped up on low time frames, keep all your levels and go to a daily chart. Chances are, you're trading hot air.

23. It's totally normal to have a really nice level or structure and yet to avoid trading it because there's nowhere logical to put a stop."
16308,2019-07-07 16:19:25+00:00,CryptoCred,"19. After enough screen time, you should be able to look at a chart and within a very short time ascertain if there's a trade there. It should scream at you. If it doesn't, there's probably nothing there.

20. It's okay to look at a chart and think ""I don't have a bloody clue."""
16309,2019-07-07 16:04:58+00:00,CryptoCred,"17. Don't switch your system up radically just because you've seen something cool. Be sceptical, test rigorously, and ask if there's even a need to introduce something new. There usually isn't.

18. A system means an actual system. Rules, diagrams, flowcharts. Not platitudes."
16310,2019-07-07 16:04:58+00:00,CryptoCred,"16. Nobody on Twitter loses. Nobody cuts winners early/holds on to losers. Nobody forgets/hesitates to pull the trigger on a setup. Nobody risks too much on losers and too little on winners. Nobody takes a setup 5 times and loses only to avoid it the 6th time, the time it works."
16311,2019-07-07 15:59:10+00:00,CryptoCred,"15. Do business where there's imbalance i.e. sharp, fast moves. That's where the big boys are playing. That's where the traders get stuck and forced to make a decision. That's where technical &amp; PA-based trading works best. Who's offside?"
16312,2019-07-07 15:59:10+00:00,CryptoCred,"13. If you feel like you're FOMOing in, ask yourself: if I get stopped out in the same candle that fills me, will I feel like an idiot? Good setup = you don't care and would take it again. 

14. If it looks too easy to be true, it's probably a good trade."
16313,2019-07-07 15:59:09+00:00,CryptoCred,"10. Trade management deserves more attention. Bad management is what turns 10R into a break even stop out (if not worse).

11. Don't move to break even for the sake of it. You're a technical trader, not a p&amp;l trader,

12. Most of the time you KNOW when a trade is a bad idea."
16314,2019-07-07 15:52:51+00:00,CryptoCred,"8. Any decent trading system tells you when/whether to have a HTF bias and how to act on it. 

9. Supply and Demand, Support/Resistance, Blocks, RTM, Pivots, etc. are all virtually the same thing and will lead you to the same levels. Mastering SR &gt; barely grasping 10 variations"
16315,2019-07-07 15:52:50+00:00,CryptoCred,"5. Most CT peeps aren't interested in trading. Stats, trade management, entry triggers, emotions, etc. Enjoy the memes and take everything with a bag of salt.

6. Not all markets treat levels in the same way. Some will almost always break&amp;pullback, others need momentum entries."
16316,2019-07-07 15:52:50+00:00,CryptoCred,"3. FTA is context-dependent. If you're a seller at a huge D1 level on a bearish chart, don't cut the trade at some M15 demand meme. 

4. The best levels come from high time frame charts. Low time frame charts are often just a means of zooming in/refining what's on HTF charts."

Will try to accommodate as many as I can.

1. Learn to trade a spot Bitcoin daily chart before pissing about with margin trading on low time frames.

2. Cutting losers is hard. Start by not doubling down on losers/widening stop."

The value in weakening S/R IMO is keeping you out of bad trades as opposed to putting you into good ones.

18561,2019-01-06 19:23:27+00:00,CryptoCred,"@loomdart Agreed. 

If you‚Äôre up 2R, move to BE because ‚Äòfree trade‚Äô and let it come back and take you out, you‚Äôve given 2R back to the market. 

It‚Äôs just an excuse for lazy people not to manage trades/pray for a moonshot/avoid coming up with some sort of system."
18562,2019-01-06 19:16:38+00:00,CryptoCred,"@ImBagsy @Chase_NL No.

You still risk potential profit (positive R) by risking being stopped out unnecessarily. 

Joe takes a 3:1 trade. Moves to BE and gets stopped out. Trade goes to target. He makes 0R, but had he stuck to his original stop he would‚Äôve made +3R. 

You‚Äôre risking your reward."

When you move your stop to BE not for technical reasons but to secure a ‚Äòwinner‚Äô, you risk getting stopped out early (thus risking R) just to feel comfortable. 

You‚Äôre letting your trade idea be invalidated without actually being wrong (unless pristine entry)."

Daily time frame looks bullish as it's likely to close through resistance.

I'd love to see a pullback to ~$140 before reaching for the next daily level at ~$170.

Idea is wrong if the top blue level doesn't hold as support on a retest. https://t.co/5qjt3zSxbC"
