crypto speak doesn't translate well to fin√§nce speak, and i'm prob being pedantic, but the media amplifies our words so let's be nuanced when we use ""blow up"" and insolvency in this situation

3154,2022-05-13 18:23:48+00:00,Melt_Dem,"8/ it will take weeks and months, not hours and days, for the effects of this type of work its way through the market. 

some firms may be insolvent but working to plug the hole behind the scenes. we won't know for some time -Mt Gox was short client funds and hid it for months."
3155,2022-05-13 18:20:21+00:00,Melt_Dem,"@Trader_Recluse sell off is inevitable, people are worried about contagion and reducing risk"
3156,2022-05-13 18:19:45+00:00,Melt_Dem,"@MattToshi very true, but that only impacts those funds and their LPs. it doesn't create contagion or cascading losses."
3157,2022-05-13 18:19:01+00:00,Melt_Dem,"7/ so let's stop focusing on funds ""blowing up"" - they just have less NAV now. 

the real ""blow up"" would be CeFi and DeFi asset managers having liabilities that exceed their assets. that's the type of insolvency that actually leads to blow ups and systemic contagion."
3158,2022-05-13 18:14:33+00:00,Melt_Dem,"6/ what is more concerning is the contagion from companies and DeFi protocols using UST to generate yield for their users

for every dollar they manage, they have a dollar of liability to their users. if they lost 30-40 cents per dollar of UST, they may not be able to cover this"
3159,2022-05-13 18:11:25+00:00,Melt_Dem,"5/ some VC firms lost 8, 9, or 10 figures of net asset value, but these firms aren't insolvent. they have other assets and positions, and deploy cash out of a separate pool ear-marked for investments. 

it just hurts their returns and potential to get paid performance fees."
3160,2022-05-13 18:09:03+00:00,Melt_Dem,"4/ most VC firms are privately owned and operated using LP capital, they have no obligation to report gains or losses to the market, only their LPs. 

if the gains were never materialized as cash in hand, then its a markdown on the fund's net asset value, which is a ""paper"" mark."
3161,2022-05-13 18:07:07+00:00,Melt_Dem,"@HideAndZEC it depends on how the loan is secured. typically there would be a debt waterfall, meaning collateral is first to repay obligations, then the firm's other assets and positions, then equity (if relevant), etc."
3162,2022-05-13 18:05:57+00:00,Melt_Dem,"@TheBatman_irl show me receipts. i haven't shilled Luna - i have no Luna in my portfolio and never have, and if so, would be disclosed. 

my only comment was to update tickers on TV outlets to retire 2017 coins like XRP, LTC, and BCH and update to more widely traded coins like SOL, LUNA, AVAX."
3163,2022-05-13 18:03:49+00:00,Melt_Dem,"3/ in the Luna / UST situation, no firm had more than 1:1 leverage (if any) and likely needed to over-collateralize any debt, and more importantly, no firm was 100% in Luna or UST 

while some may have incurred significant losses, it is highly unlikely any are insolvent right now"
3164,2022-05-13 17:58:57+00:00,Melt_Dem,"2/ for example, when the $20B family office Archegos blew up, prime brokers were stuck with ~$10B of losses and liabilities

because Archegos had 5x margin, they only needed $1 of collateral per $5 of debt

credit suisse lost $5.5B, Nomura $3B, Morgan Stanley $1B"
3165,2022-05-13 17:55:48+00:00,Melt_Dem,"1/ what grinds my gears: saying ""x fund blew up"" to describe realized or unrealized losses resulting from LUNA / UST exposure

in the traditional fund world, blowing up implies becoming insolvent, and often, creating a cascade of other liabilities and losses w your counterparties"

at @CoinSharesCo, we believe blockchain-based financial computation will eat all markets.

it makes markets absolutely massive. it makes liquidity possible in ways that we've never imagined before. it blows the doors open on the fungibility of assets. https://t.co/pRvu3qvcSu"

7108,2021-09-27 14:37:12+00:00,Melt_Dem,"12/ to date, nearly $8 of TVL has been bridged from Ethereum into not only L2's, but also other L1's

in the quest for available and affordable financial compute, all assets are becoming fungible liquidity across all chains https://t.co/SsMhohrvme"
7109,2021-09-27 14:35:31+00:00,Melt_Dem,"11/ the current experiment, given the demand for Ethereum block space exceeds its supply, is bridging Ethereum from L1 into L2

how do we make financial compute liquid and fungible? https://t.co/t9IUH9wx7i"
7115,2021-09-27 14:25:39+00:00,Melt_Dem,"6/ as such, block space itself is a financial primitive

the demand for block space ie financial computation will persistently exceed supply on all networks

this has been the case since as early as 2017

so we make trade-offs to enable more financial computation on blockchains https://t.co/IN7hWjJYmZ"
7116,2021-09-27 14:23:51+00:00,Melt_Dem,"5/ the bitcoin network prices demand for secure financial transactions in the form of tsxn fees

in the last five months, bitcoin more than tripled its prior 2017 all time high of 20k, hitting 65k at one point. 

ethereum has yet to triple its 2018 all time high of 1400, and is currently trading around 3400

traders are positioned to capture $ETH upside!"
10328,2021-05-18 17:20:03+00:00,Melt_Dem,"2/ over the last few weeks, BTC option skew was relatively bearish. 

in #bitcoin, the tail (ie futures / options) wags the dog. this past week, we saw BTC spot prices drift lower, which proved options skews to be right.

miner costs $12k = 0.2 BTC @ $60k BTC

you mine 0.2 BTC year one, 0.15 BTC year two, 0.125 BTC year three, and ASIC is obsolete ($0 resale) year four.

buying 0.2 BTC = 0.2 BTC

mining = 0.2 + 0.15 + 0.125 = 0.475 BTC

but according to @defipulse, even here, USDT still dominates, with 48% of stablecoin TVL

17693,2020-08-29 19:39:54+00:00,Melt_Dem,"4/ ok - 1B tokens, split between team, investors, and ""rewards"" for node operators

unlikely the team has sold all of their tokens, and rewards aren't being issued yet, so probably 50% or more of supply is not in the market yet. helpful to know! 

so what drives $LINK demand? https://t.co/h1UI9Cpi7K"
17694,2020-08-29 19:36:57+00:00,Melt_Dem,"3/ always look at the token emission schedule and distribution!

let's take @chainlink's $LINK as an example (no exposure personally or via @CoinSharesCo )

@MessariCrypto aggregates this data (i'm an investor in that co) so it's a good starting point

https://t.co/B0w8VYP39L"
17695,2020-08-29 19:33:37+00:00,Melt_Dem,"2/ there is often a huge reserve of ""unvested"" tokens that ""vests"" and become liquid over a period of time. 

as these tokens vest, investors sell and unless there is a consumption-driven demand (staking, liquidity pooling, burning) or sustained buying.

then number go down."

18022,2020-08-19 15:30:29+00:00,Melt_Dem,"12/ in conclusion, Bitcoin‚Äôs investment characteristics historically make it attractive as
- a driver of returns, and 
- a portfolio diversifier

compared to other alternatives, Bitcoin delivers outsized positive impacts even at very low allocation sizes!

18023,2020-08-19 15:29:12+00:00,Melt_Dem,"11/ and lastly, bitcoin may well be suited to fill the current gap in available diversifiers troubling portfolio managers.

*#Bitcoin is a unique asset*

18024,2020-08-19 15:27:17+00:00,Melt_Dem,"10/ for those who are DARING, the most significant improvements in the Sharpe ratio are gained through an allocation of up to 10% bitcoin.

18025,2020-08-19 15:25:32+00:00,Melt_Dem,"9/ we constructed a sample portfolio and found a 4% allocation to bitcoin produced optimal results in a traditional 60/40 portfolio. 

our analysis highlights that it both enhances returns and increases diversification, regardless of the length of the backtest. https://t.co/Zhj8HhwBdp"
18026,2020-08-19 15:24:50+00:00,Melt_Dem,"8/ so on to #Bitcoin in a portfolio! 

#Bitcoin is an asset in its infancy, leading many in the investment industry to struggle allocating it into the correct ‚Äúbucket‚Äù. https://t.co/YFbzpJvpN7"

during periods of economic uncertainty and dollar weakness, #Bitcoin is likely to benefit in the same way as gold.

If bitcoin‚Äôs financialization continues, it will be unable to remain insulated from the financial system. https://t.co/KmOZO2TpwD"
18028,2020-08-19 15:22:22+00:00,Melt_Dem,"6/ inevitably, people will ask - what about what about volatility? let's look at gold. 

gold purchased as an investment only took off after the 1970‚Äôs. until 1975, the possession of gold was illegal.

gold became financialized, and as this happened, its volatility declined. https://t.co/rH5AFuFAGI"
18029,2020-08-19 15:18:36+00:00,Melt_Dem,"5/ the market has also evolved to accommodate institutional investors with services such as prime brokerage, trading tools and insured custody, paving the way for further financialization.

22978,2019-09-27 17:08:30+00:00,Melt_Dem,"8/ i'm not so sure.

bitcoin is a cultural movement. bitcoin is for people. bitcoin is about principles. 

how do we allow for more participation via intermediaries without losing the message? curious to hear what you think. https://t.co/de5JTxrAR9"
22979,2019-09-27 17:03:37+00:00,Melt_Dem,"7/ what happens when an intermediary holding 5% of all bitcoin gets hacked? what about 10%? 

what happens when institutions put bitcoin in cold storage and start trading paper bitcoin depository receipts (BDRs) instead of actual coin? 

... is that still bitcoin?"
22980,2019-09-27 16:59:11+00:00,Melt_Dem,"6/ well fortunately, we have history as a guide.

bank bailouts are common. crypto bailouts have also happened (see DAO below)

in May, when Binance's hot wallet holding 0.03% of all bitcoin in circulation was hacked, a chain roll-back was suggested and discussed and rejected. https://t.co/amloORcz8d"
22981,2019-09-27 16:52:41+00:00,Melt_Dem,"5/ when you have a small number of firms holding a large number of assets, you centralize risk

with legacy finance, this is dangerous but not deadly.

with bitcoin, this is both dangerous and potentially deadly. what happens when a large intermediary gets hacked?"
22982,2019-09-27 16:50:01+00:00,Melt_Dem,"4/ why does this matter? well, history usually helps us understand what the future might look like.

in response to the financial crisis, the US government created a new designation for financial institutions - one called a SIFI or systemically important financial institution https://t.co/LDLQ9sdonf"
22983,2019-09-27 16:46:52+00:00,Melt_Dem,"3/ so where are the coins?

if 100% is all bitcoin mined to date, roughly 17% is in third party custody (although the number is likely higher)

that's pretty significant https://t.co/azUiexIELv"

24856,2019-04-15 20:44:13+00:00,Melt_Dem,"‚Äúthere is no final one; revolutions are infinite.‚Äù

the battle for privacy won‚Äôt be fought in one medium, at one time, or in some grandiose, defining way. The battle for privacy begins with the choices we make every moment‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääboth small and large‚Ää. 

choose privacy."
24857,2019-04-15 20:43:31+00:00,Melt_Dem,"crypto is about freedom.

it‚Äôs not about creating a new revenue stream for Wall St or delivering big IPO returns to investors. Those might be nice second order effects, but I reject the notion that this is the primary goal."
24858,2019-04-15 20:42:51+00:00,Melt_Dem,"we, as users of cryptocurrencies and other forms of applied cryptography in communications and computing, are doing something decidedly cypherpunk

we are participating in proving that these early prototypes have merit, and we are directly participating in their evolution."
24859,2019-04-15 20:41:53+00:00,Melt_Dem,"people often ask me - ""why do you need privacy?""

if we do not value our privacy today, and do not protect, preserve, and enhance our privacy using technology, then we create the conditions for a future where our privacy has no value.

26036,2019-02-05 21:03:04+00:00,Melt_Dem,"17/ history shows us that most forms of governance begin as ‚Äúbenign‚Äù in nature‚Ää - ‚Ääwhether it be monarchy, aristocracy or democracy - but over time are abused &amp; become malignant - devolving into tyranny, oligarchy &amp; ochlocracy.

26037,2019-02-05 21:01:53+00:00,Melt_Dem,"16/ ultimately, tools are neither inherently good or bad, just or unjust; but they take on these traits when employed by humans.

‚Äúabsolute power corrupts absolutely‚Äù is perhaps a fitting reminder of what happens when we couple power with politics in protocols."

26039,2019-02-05 20:58:25+00:00,Melt_Dem,"14/ we already see this through services that support crypto funds in ‚Äúcompounding‚Äù their assets &amp; taking advantage of the opportunity to earn financial returns in staking.
