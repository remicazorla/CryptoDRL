The simple goal would be to rapidly expand L2 adoption and allow *all* users, here today, to swap, send, and receive assets fluidly.

131,2021-11-30 21:01:32+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"And the best part is, those who still want to interact and pay gas fees on L1 are entirely free to do so, just with slightly higher fees.

But if you're a whale casually paying $100 for a swap, an increase of $20 or $50 isn't much. For everyday users, it's everything."
132,2021-11-30 21:01:32+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"The idea would be to heighten the cost of L1 activities, in favor of dramatically lowering the cost to bridge to L2.

If a segment of block space is only used for bridging, this could bring bridging costs down dramatically, allowing all to move from L1 to L2 here today."
133,2021-11-30 21:01:31+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"Quick question:

Could we implement an update to the Ethereum network that would set aside a portion of the block space for bridging transactions?

146,2021-11-20 21:50:25+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"3.) Higher Swap Fees

L2's are generally much more costly at the moment than competing layer ones:

Wanna make a swap?

Arbitrum: $5.44

Avalanche: $0.89
Solana: &lt; $0.01

Polygon is the only outlier, only costing $0.04 per swap."
147,2021-11-20 21:50:25+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"2.) I constantly here people say:

""Hate high gas fees? Use L2s or sidechains""

And I think this is an incredibly backwards take. Because the moment you tell them that, they'll just use another L1. There's literally no incentive to use L2's at the moment. Why?"

Total Market Cap Cycle Top: $10 trillion

Many are expecting the cycle to be over in a matter of months (Q1-Q2 of 2022), but I tend to believe things take longer than expected, and I'm estimating that things could drag on towards Q4 of 2022 to Q1 of 2023, with another 'May 2021' styled correction in between 📉"

My rough thoughts on altcoin dominance:

The top isn't in for altcoin dominance (will likely be 75% this cycle), and right now may be one of the worst times to rotate from altcoins to bitcoin.

#FED"
470,2020-07-21 14:26:13+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"Putting aside any personal biases of what asset I prefer over another:

Cryptocurrencies are the only asset class that can realistically double or triple as a whole in the next year.

Focus on markets of scale #bitcoin"

Yes, it will create a new Celsius account which is fine to do even if you already have one 👍 And if you can, contact the in-app support under the profile tab.

“Hey Jim, hows the company’s financials looking?”

540,2020-06-08 21:05:00+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"For those that need reasoning, it's a matter of keeping things familiar and easy to understand. It's easy for the vast majority of people to understand that with many bits, you can make a bitcoin. But satoshis sounds like you're talking about something entirely different."
541,2020-06-08 20:41:50+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"In hindsight, and will all due respect to Satoshi, fractions of a bitcoin shouldn't have been called satoshis or mBTC.

They should have just been called bits."
542,2020-05-30 19:48:17+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"The second space race is upon us! Congrats @SpaceX and @NASA, you're doing great things. Brings a tear to my eye to see a new wave of rocket technology truly being utilized."
543,2020-05-27 13:13:04+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"(7) In conclusion, I’ll bet money they’re gonna be offering cryptocurrency investment services in the next three years. Let’s see if their actions match their words 😏"
544,2020-05-27 13:13:04+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"(6) And to top it all off, they feel that, though traders are interested in buying/selling it in the short term, it negates it as a longterm investment. Kind of like how people rampantly traded tech companies that inevitably came to dominate equity markets?"
545,2020-05-27 13:13:03+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"(5) Supposedly they believe bitcoin hasn’t hedged against inflation. Whether directly correlated or not, bitcoin has absolutely hedged against inflation, and provided returns many times over against inflation."
546,2020-05-27 13:13:03+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"(4) They site that bitcoin doesn’t provide a yield like a bond. Gold and many other assets don’t provide a yield, or...were they referring to those lucrative negative yields? You know, the ones in Europe that penalize you for holding them?"
547,2020-05-27 13:13:02+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"(3) To them, Bitcoin’s volatility dismantles it’s ability to be an asset. Goldman Sachs...allow me to introduce you to the multi trillion dollar commodity, oil, which turned negative just a couple of weeks ago. Oh but that’s a market, right?"
548,2020-05-27 13:13:02+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"(2) They claim that the only reason people buy bitcoin is because they expect to sell it to another person at a higher price. You know, the same exact thing you expect every time you buy a stock, bond, property, etc."
549,2020-05-27 13:13:01+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"(1) First, cryptocurrencies are most certainly a new asset class. They’re the only know asset that can have a finite (capped) suppply, seperating it from precious metals like gold that are limited to a degree."
550,2020-05-27 13:12:59+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"So Goldman Sachs have a presentation titled: 

""Cryptocurrencies Including Bitcoin Are Not an Asset Class""

Here’s why they’re wrong on that and so much more."
551,2020-05-21 18:59:33+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,@TwitterSupport One of my Twitter accounts has been removed. I filed to get the suspension removed weeks ago. Is there any way I can get things resolved?
552,2020-05-20 02:00:43+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"@RichardRyan Yeah, including the growth he's gotten from JRE Clips, I can definitely see your point. It's a great lure to get people to check out the full-length podcasts. But you're right, this is a really bold move on Joe's part. It'll be interesting to see people make the switch to Spotify"
553,2020-05-19 21:33:20+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"For clarification, Joe moving to Spotify exclusively is a huge message to YouTube as a company. Being the 2nd largest platform for traffic of his podcast (behind podcast downloads), it's clear this is the culmination of weak copyright strikes, censorship, and poor communication."
554,2020-05-19 20:31:07+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"As someone who uses YouTube more than any other platform on the web (and has been using it since 2007), let this be a lesson for when you put advertisers before the people who make up your platform."
555,2020-05-18 22:48:07+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"@JeanneDeBit @HodlMegl @ChartsBtc From my analysis, it will have a long-term lasting effect for the hash rate. But for price, it'll instantly start applying positive upward pressure for price. We'll have to see if we can keep buying pressure though, because if we don't, then price could still drop 😀"
556,2020-05-18 21:03:02+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"I've been looking for this chart for ages! When the halving occurs, it leaves a lasting impact on the supply/demand dynamic of bitcoin. As miners are the largest sellers on a daily basis, the halving event greatly reduces their weight on the market. Great job @ChartsBtc!"
557,2020-05-12 19:29:57+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,Was a true pleasure speaking with @CamiRusso @Liqquidity and @mattysino at Consensus Distributed 😀 We talked about the brewing macro environment for crypto and China developments. https://t.co/a5JRnYt5AE
558,2020-05-11 19:49:14+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"The biggest thing on my mind post-halving event is what topic people with direct their interest towards? DeFi, smart wallets, etc.?

Curious to get your thoughts 🤔"

759,2019-04-09 17:20:28+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"If Facebook is considering the launch of a stable coin, this is big news. Opening up an audience of 2,000,000,000 people to storing and transferring money elsewhere could not only expand real crypto adoption, but provide a framework for millions in unbanked economies."
760,2019-04-09 17:02:44+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"Congrats on the news for @UnificationUND, @neyma 😀 Seems like it was just yesterday when met in Chiang Mai. All the best in further developing the project."
761,2019-04-08 14:43:39+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"If you’re in Switzerland on the 11th, come out to our meetup for Project Genesis 😀 Thanks to the @decentraLIVE team for hosting the event!"
762,2019-04-07 10:55:39+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"@teddycleps Booking a flight back as we speak, I’ve got to make sure my European friends eat good!"
763,2019-04-07 10:51:58+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"I eat so much Chipotle, that if I skipped out from eating it for a week, it would have a noticeable effect on their quarterly earnings."
764,2019-04-03 10:32:32+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"We'll be doing a meetup at a local WeWorks in London, so if you're free this Thursday, come on by! I'd love to see you 😀

WeWorks Market Square
1 Mark Square
EC2A 4EG
Thursday, 4th of April at 5:30pm"
765,2019-04-01 14:36:49+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"@QuintenFrancois @enhancedmoney Thanks for the wonderful opportunity, Quinten 😀 It’s always a pleasure to catch up man!"
766,2019-03-31 09:54:46+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"@blockblanc I’m not comparing their fundamentals, I’m saying that what has given ETH most of its market value (a means of fundraising) can be easily sucked up by binance in the short term. I’m aware BNB doesn’t have a developer community, or any real utility."
767,2019-03-31 08:49:28+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"@pete18529821 Thanks, Pete! Would love to see you at the London event."
768,2019-03-31 07:57:24+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"For those in Amsterdam, come join us at the https://t.co/E993s4vhtQ building to discuss Project Genesis and crypto in general! Details can be found below 😀"
769,2019-03-30 23:02:02+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"@BrettRichey 100% agree, Brett. This space, ironically enough as prices have declined, has gotten much more interesting. Better wallets, more focus on lending applications. I get a sense the space is finally starting to spot where the real value is in this technology."
770,2019-03-30 22:55:50+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"@BrettRichey I will revoke the first part of my tweet, I don't mean to say there hasn't been anything cool/impactful built on Ethereum. Projects like Dharma and other lending platforms are right down my alley. But undoubtly, the vast majority of its value comes from being a funding mechanism."
771,2019-03-30 22:48:24+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"I think Binance realized something. It's clear ETH's main function was crowdfunding (ICOs). It has yet to prove much else in terms of a use case.

Binance Chain is an aim to take that spot, and with the momentum of BNB and IEOs, they're creating the framework for ICO mania 2.0"
772,2019-03-29 23:41:37+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,The people here during the calm of the bear market are the ones who are building the future of crypto 😀 @hettalentctc @MeyadeC https://t.co/POmjMHalHp
773,2019-03-29 19:42:21+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"@Guido43357821 @LiskCenter @enhancedmoney No, I don't. They just hosted the event."
774,2019-03-29 19:40:27+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"@_Kevin_Pham Ironically, I think most of us in the space gave crap to utility tokens vs. protocol tokens, but ironically, they've ended up being the more successful model for real adoption."
775,2019-03-29 19:37:33+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"Had a blast in Utrecht at the @LiskCenter discussing what we're aiming to do at @enhancedmoney! My biggest takeaway, don't underestimate the Netherlands! The crypto community here is thriving more than ever. https://t.co/ihtEF8xXhH"
776,2019-03-28 23:02:39+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,@PFreto I’ll be near Amsterdam until the 2nd of April!
777,2019-03-28 16:48:39+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"For those coming to the meetup in Utrecht, here’s a map to get to the building. Can’t wait to see you all! 😀 https://t.co/GfCfRIX7Bq"
778,2019-03-27 17:39:36+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"Thank you, @Mounia_NL! 😀 I can't wait to meet everyone and talk further about what we're trying to do."
779,2019-03-26 19:09:18+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"@OmniscientAsian @LiskCenter My apologizes for the confusion. We'll be doing the event in Utrecht instead, but there's no need for extra tickets. We may do a meetup afterwards in Amsterdam, and I'll be sure to let you know about that after the meetup."
780,2019-03-26 18:24:15+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"If you're near Utrecht, we'd love to have you at the first Project Genesis meetup! It'll be hosted at the @LiskCenter (Jaarbeursplein 6, Utrecht) from 7:30pm to 10:00 pm on the 28th 😀 Come say hi!"
781,2019-03-26 18:21:19+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"For more information, check out and follow the @LiskCenter!"
782,2019-03-26 13:32:10+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,@KomodoWorld Feel free to reach out to me! Would love to discuss things further 😀
783,2019-03-26 13:21:07+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"@Brad_Laurie Thanks Brad, it means a lot! I can’t wait to share more in the near future."
784,2019-03-26 13:19:36+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"@crypto_rand Thanks Rand, I really appreciate it and can’t wait to share more!"
785,2019-03-26 12:47:01+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"@Mounia_NL Thanks, Mounia!"
786,2019-03-25 21:25:56+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"@realcwilliamson Yeah, I do feel big tech firms are more likely to be competition than traditional finance. Apple's credit card reveal proved that today."
787,2019-03-25 16:59:03+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,@cryptoismylife @telcoin_team Will give them a look 👍
788,2019-03-25 16:38:09+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"@FuturesNull 100% agree. Wallets are definitely improving, but we've got a long way to go towards building systems that work well in the west."
789,2019-03-25 16:35:40+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"@AllonMessenberg At @enhancedmoney, we're aiming to do both. Crypto can liberate those who need it most and those who could be getting a much better deal than they are now."
790,2019-03-25 16:32:55+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"@CryptoMichNL @QuintenFrancois @squatch_crypto @ZeusZissou @TheCryptoDog @davthewave @Di0nysos_ @CryptoLeee @crypto_rand @cointradernik @TheCryptoLark @boxmining @readysetcrypto Right back at you, Quinten! https://t.co/eZvpy9VLZM"
791,2019-03-25 16:27:56+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"For crypto to emerge as a currency market, we have to build lending functionality. If you provide an competitive, censorship-resistant, and transparent banking system, the unbanked will use crypto."
792,2019-03-21 16:43:11+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"This is so important to understand. Even with the hack, if these people liked bitcoin back in 2011-2013, I’m assured most will still be bullish today. This could be a net positive."
793,2019-03-17 11:39:11+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"@CryptoSolha Feel free to check out our site, where you can join our github, discord, reddit and much more. We'll even have some events coming in the next few days!"
794,2019-03-17 10:57:23+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"Today, I'm revealing Project Genesis, an open-source initiative that aims to increase adoption of cryptocurrencies and build a decentralized, open framework for finance.

795,2019-03-16 21:40:31+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"@baalzimon Ah, she’s one of the “I’m open to a debate, but I’ll start off by letting you know I’m right” types, yikes...😬"
796,2019-03-16 21:33:23+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"This is exactly in line with my argument for going back to the horse and buggy! We just can’t risk using cars, homes or our credit ca-...wait a minute."
797,2019-03-10 14:44:02+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"3/17/19 🍀
Stay tuned everyone!"
798,2019-03-08 01:43:10+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"@Bagsky10 @SubstratumNet Would love to make it out to the next monthly meeting, I’m a tad bit busy, but I’ll see what I can do 👍"
799,2019-03-07 11:42:03+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"@Sjaaaakster Looks interesting, I’ll have to give it a look once I get the chance."
800,2019-03-07 11:31:57+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"@joonian Tokenomx in Bangkok and Hong Kong Blockchain Week in...well, I’ll let you guess that one."
801,2019-03-07 11:30:07+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"6. And finally, not a single person showed me their portfolio.

Ladies and gentlemen, we’ve reached peak bear market!"
802,2019-03-07 11:30:06+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"5. Are there still rampant discussions of the next big thing, i.e. security tokens? Yes. Are there promising ideas? Sure, but it seems more are coming to focus on what’s been proven to work for crypto; money."
803,2019-03-07 11:30:05+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"4. Status of ICOs?
*crickets*
As it should be...😉"
804,2019-03-07 11:30:04+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"3. A variety of P2P crypto trading and crypto-backed lending platforms have been seeing immense growth, and have become much more frequent at these events. This really excites me personally."
805,2019-03-07 11:30:03+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"2. It seems that most enterprise projects are focusing on B2B solutions and revenue, rather than trying to convince people about buying their token (where instead the project buys the tokens with generated revenue). Much smarter IMO."
806,2019-03-07 11:30:02+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"1. Wallets have improved immensely. With improved design, built-in access to DEXs and dapps, and simplified private key management, its starting feel like you can “become your own bank”."
807,2019-03-07 11:30:02+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"I’ve been between two conferences this week, and the quality of people, as well as projects, has shown me that crypto is making real progress.

Here are my thoughts:"
808,2019-02-16 18:54:29+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"Currently at NeoDevcon, and it’s been one of the more alive conferences I’ve been to in a while! Check out their livestream below if you want to tune in:
https://t.co/OpcIHbRUHu"
809,2019-02-07 18:22:20+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"There we have it. @SunTrust and @BBT join together to form the largest bank merger since the financial crisis ($66 billion).

And just like in 2008, when mistakes are made, we'll simply bail them out as usual and claim they're ""too big to fail"" when things go wrong."
810,2019-02-07 18:07:45+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,Can't wait to speak at @tokenomx later this month. The event will be from February 27th to the 28th. Hope you guys can make it! https://t.co/9oeqXud6b6
811,2019-02-05 21:28:57+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"Can't wait to do my telegram AMA for @tokenomx, I hope to see you all there!  https://t.co/4cMYzvByZ4"
812,2019-01-31 16:47:14+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"@crypto_n_more I probably won't livestream, but we're definitely gonna get some footage for the daily updates and possibly have some interviews with members of the NEO ecosystem!"
813,2019-01-31 15:45:42+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"I'll be attending Neo DevCon 2019 in Seattle, and I'd love to see you all if you can make it. If you use the code NEODATADASH, you can get discounted tickets as well. Excited to meet such a wide range of blockchain advocates!"
814,2019-01-24 00:08:48+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"@eLGOcsgo With a corrupt government and unstable currency, Venezuela is the perfect match for crypto adoption. This video is living proof that people have hit the breaking point, are fed up, and no longer trust their government."
815,2019-01-24 00:06:10+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"@TheCryptoLark I'm not taking much of a position of the coup. But people can only stand hyperinflation &amp; corrupt leadership for so long. I share doubts that the replacement will be much better, but no matter what happens, the citizens of the country will forever distrust their government."
816,2019-01-23 23:36:17+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"Venezuela will be one of the main starting points of the future crypto revolution. Take back your freedom, Venezuela!"
817,2019-01-19 21:09:42+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"@koreanoprah @tokenomx Thanks for the kind remarks, Janie! Can't wait to make it back out and see everyone 😀"
818,2019-01-15 19:57:04+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"I don't care to spark a debate on the topic of #Brexit, but one thing is clear:
The UK has MUCH more interesting politics than the US. I know so much of it is a show, but boy does it outweigh anything I've seen on C-SPAN in the last decade."

https://t.co/N4FQJJodBR"
820,2019-01-09 19:07:45+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,I hate to sound emotional but I've never felt so honored and privileged to be a part of a community as I have with crypto. From the freedom loving cypherpunks to the traditional investors gone crypto fanatics. The foundation we're laying will forever change the course of history.
821,2019-01-05 00:50:08+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"@EirikMBr @cryptotothemoo1 Roof top installations mostly from my understanding. There are official studies online that display the stats, and I think they may also explain the major causes of death behind each energy source."
822,2019-01-04 23:24:37+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"@cryptotothemoo1 I’m a major proponent of most renewables, but I like nuclear for a lot of reasons. Reactors can operate for a long time, and surprising to most, it produces the least deaths per energy unit produced, even less than wind or solar."
823,2019-01-04 15:20:51+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"@jstattsiv No, I absolutely think those things built a bubble, and US stocks are going lower in 2019. I talk about this on my channel all the time. But QE is over and rates are nearing 3% this year. Seeing this kind of growth in this environment is extremely positive to put it lightly."
824,2019-01-04 15:16:02+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,@RayDalio I admire to such a high degree Ray's perspective on hearing out other points of view. It's amazing how different things can appear from hearing another person's perspective.
825,2019-01-04 15:13:29+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"@kryptografisi The unemployment rate is fake to a decent degree, that I can agree with. Job postings, not so much."
826,2019-01-04 15:06:02+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"@GaryCrypto1 Yeah, that happens every year. But the standout from last year is that the amount of jobs in full-time, good paying fields are rising even in a global slowdown.

December 2017:
Construction 30,000
Manufacturing 25,000

December 2018:
Construction 38,000
Manufacturing 32,000"
827,2019-01-04 14:54:00+00:00,Nicholas_Merten,"In December, 312,000 jobs were created in the US, including 50,000 jobs in health care, 38,000 in construction, and 32,000 in manufacturing.

This paints a clear picture that, even with a global slowdown around the corner, that the US is the favorable place for investment."
