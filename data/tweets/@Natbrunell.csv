1505,2022-08-06 22:50:39+00:00,natbrunell,"""I want the world to be better for future generations."" 
-Dr. Jeff Ross

Lots of insightful and thought-provoking takes on the macro picture and #Bitcoin from my 3 most recent guests:

@FossGregfoss
@JeffBooth
@VailshireCap

Don't miss these talks: https://t.co/3g6UtTSXgD https://t.co/foadtLuJxJ"
1506,2022-08-06 16:36:50+00:00,natbrunell,"So long as we are free and have free markets the best ideas will always win on their own. 

I want to contribute as a forum for this discussion so better decisions are made and freedom grows rather than being stifled by concentration of power. I‚Äôm hear to listen and learn more."
1507,2022-08-06 16:33:55+00:00,natbrunell,"One view is that regulations will better integrate Bitcoin in the financial system making on ramps simpler, speeding up adoption. 

The other view is government is inherently corrupt and incompetent and regulators will distort free markets and ultimately hold Bitcoin back."
1508,2022-08-06 16:33:55+00:00,natbrunell,"There are competing views on whether regulations are good or bad, and what regulations are appropriate. 

Open debate is consistent with the core values of Bitcoin and I encourage it."
1509,2022-08-06 16:33:54+00:00,natbrunell,"Attempts to regulate this space are likely in the next Congress. We need to vote for candidates who understand and support the core values of Bitcoin. Lots of great efforts are happening in this arena, but there is lots of work to be done to ensure Bitcoin is apolitical."
1510,2022-08-06 16:33:47+00:00,natbrunell,"üßµü™°A brief thread on the regulation of digital assets:

The fundamental core values of #Bitcoin are freedom and individualism.

Bitcoin is the best monetary technology ever invented. So long as there are free markets Bitcoin will dominate."
1511,2022-08-06 15:52:22+00:00,natbrunell,"@ErikVoorhees Hi Erik! Respect your work and want to clarify I‚Äôm very against coercion and big government, though I do think regulation is coming and I‚Äôm bullish clarity could help more adoption. Always learning and improving since my background is more general so thanks for the feedback! ü§ùüèº"
1512,2022-08-06 15:48:48+00:00,natbrunell,"Always learning and getting more and more bullish on #Bitcoin 

The best part about getting in this space is realizing how much there is to learn and grow in understanding ‚Äî with the ultimate chance to set the world in a more positive direction."

5836,2020-08-18 19:16:53+00:00,natbrunell,"For reference, here was my original request back in March -- which still has yet to be fulfilled by @CountyofLA/@lapublichealth. #journalism #COVID19 #transparency #government #pandemic #news https://t.co/FtyWOQ5Ryo"

5838,2020-08-18 18:39:12+00:00,natbrunell,"I was informed by @CountyofLA the other responsive records couldn't be provided because (among the reasons): they were an invasion of privacy, public interest wouldn't be served by disclosing them, and some of these emails to/from Ferrer were privileged."
5839,2020-08-18 18:39:12+00:00,natbrunell,"Which now brings me to why I am posting this tweet thread. A month after I requested *the first 5 emails ever sent to and from LA County's director of @lapublichealth, Dr. Barbara Ferrer containing the term 'COVID,'* I got responsive records. 3 emails, which I will share...."

5842,2020-08-18 18:39:11+00:00,natbrunell,Spoke again to @CountyofLA and was advised to narrow my request further. The county suggested I remove e-mail attachments from my request because the downloads were time-consuming and again made my request cumbersome. I consented to removing the attachments for now. More delays.
5843,2020-08-18 18:39:11+00:00,natbrunell,I was advised to limit my request to a shorter time frame and maybe limit the search terms.  I submitted a new request asking only for e-mails ending in .gov or .org (to cover city/state/fed officials) and adjusted the time frame to just Jan. More delays ensued from @CountyofLA.
5844,2020-08-18 18:39:10+00:00,natbrunell,"Finally I spoke with someone from @CountyofLA who indicated my request was too cumbersome and would result in about 10,000 emails per day. (Which came as a surprise, as my ask was pretty specific -- relating to COVID19 and requesting e-mails from only 2 individuals' email boxes)."
5845,2020-08-18 18:39:10+00:00,natbrunell,"In March, I requested e-mails with extremely specific terms related to the coronavirus for a finite period of time (January to early-March) to/from two @lapublichealth leaders. @CountyofLA began a series of delays on the records request. 14 days... another 14 days..."
5846,2020-08-18 18:39:10+00:00,natbrunell,"When Safer-At-Home orders first came down in LA in March, I initiated a public records request with @lapublichealth to find out about @CountyofLA's initial response to the #COVID19 pandemic.
