136,2022-12-30 20:24:35+00:00,jessewldn,Conflating consumer surplus and ownership is a category error; user-owned platforms can/do employee the same growth tactics of deferred monetization to yield consumer surplus (e.g. Uniswap's fee switch); that choice has little/nothing to do with ownership.

199,2022-11-04 17:34:02+00:00,jessewldn,"Rather, protocols should simply seek to drive integrations that result in stronger network effects. If this can be done, both protocols and the products on top can likely step into the flow of value."
200,2022-11-04 17:34:02+00:00,jessewldn,So to revisit last years Products vs. Protocols piece: I‚Äôd de-emphasize the idea that protocols should seek to commoditize their complements.
201,2022-11-04 17:34:02+00:00,jessewldn,"A protocol can provide the best pricing, or be the most trusted to be routed to because of liquidity, risk management, or lindy‚Äîall forms of switching costs which can likely be extracted."

203,2022-11-04 17:34:01+00:00,jessewldn,"For that to be true, products and protocol need to specialize in different areas of value creation."
204,2022-11-04 17:34:00+00:00,jessewldn,"I‚Äôve come around to the view that this is a myopic framing. Great products expand the addressable market for protocols, and so long as there‚Äôs a network effect in the protocol, there‚Äôs likely a place for both to capture some value."
205,2022-11-04 17:34:00+00:00,jessewldn,"In my published framework of Protocols vs. Product, I framed product level fees as in direct competition with fees that protocols can charge."
206,2022-11-04 17:34:00+00:00,jessewldn,What does that mean for protocols?
207,2022-11-04 17:33:59+00:00,jessewldn,"So for practical purposes, we should assume the default: products that people want will monetize"
208,2022-11-04 17:33:59+00:00,jessewldn,"So while its true that earning tokens from a protocol treasury is a nice-to-have, and potentially a new source of revenue for product teams, it just doesn‚Äôt stack up to controlling your own destiny by earning cold hard fees directly from customers."
209,2022-11-04 17:33:58+00:00,jessewldn,And its a stronger default than what last year‚Äôs post suggested: that product teams could forgo fees by instead earning tokens from the protocols they build on top of.
210,2022-11-04 17:33:58+00:00,jessewldn,"Of course, building a great business is a very strong incentive to build a product in the first place. Its the default reason most do it."

Web3's ownership economy provides us with new tools to execute it, to grow networks to become bigger, and more valuable than their predecessors.

Here's the pocket playbook from the post: https://t.co/9cCfboKq20"
754,2021-11-30 16:04:24+00:00,jessewldn,"This is warranted, but ultimately, protocol treasuries would be wise to optimize for multiple teams incentivized similarly, to grow the pie bigger, faster. 

Grants and meritocratic developer mining programs are ways of achieving this, but we need more sophisticated work on this."
755,2021-11-30 16:04:24+00:00,jessewldn,"3/ Often, the initial protocol/product duo that helped to bootstrap network effects in a Web3 platform is rightfully rewarded for their outsized contribution to the ecosystem with an allocation of tokens..."
756,2021-11-30 16:04:23+00:00,jessewldn,"2/ Both product and protocol teams should be aligned around a shared KPI: protocol growth. 

Measuring against a shared protocol-level metric helps ensure the product is truly complementary, and can be an anchor for meritocratic distribution of value-driven."
757,2021-11-30 16:04:23+00:00,jessewldn,"The product team learns what end-users need, and can help inform the protocol design. And as the protocol team learns what product devs require, they can consider adding features that will attract more of them."
758,2021-11-30 16:04:23+00:00,jessewldn,"1/ As a Web3 platform matures, there may be a benefit to structuring the core project development work between two teams: those focused on the underlying platform or protocol, and those building the initial product for the end-user."
759,2021-11-30 16:04:22+00:00,jessewldn,"Wrapping up, some üí≠ for builders looking to execute the Web3 version of ""commoditize the compliment:"""
760,2021-11-30 16:04:22+00:00,jessewldn,"Some early examples include grants programs from large DeFi protocols, like @uniswapgrants  and @compoundgrants, or developer rewards from L1/L2 protocols.

@LiquityProtocol rewards devs who build front-ends to for their stablecoin with $LQTY pro-rata based on user deposits."
761,2021-11-30 16:04:22+00:00,jessewldn,"The Web3 model of commoditizing the complement demands a structural distinction between protocol from product, with an economic equilibrium that symbiotically links them together.

There's lots of optimization work to do here."
762,2021-11-30 16:04:22+00:00,jessewldn,"This is how Web3 projects can commoditize the complement, not as a means of draining profits and position from a potential competitor, but as a practical means of furthering sustainable co-opatition between product teams."
763,2021-11-30 16:04:21+00:00,jessewldn,"This practice of progressive decentralization aligns incentives around growing value in the underlying protocol, putting teams that earn tokens for their contribution in a better position to commoditize their own products and drive further growth."
764,2021-11-30 16:04:21+00:00,jessewldn,"These network effects helped attract third-party developers (e.g. @rainbowdotme) who built more functionality, attracting more users and usage. 

Next, a distribution of ownership in the form of tokens was aimed at those driving the value: users and developers."
765,2021-11-30 16:04:21+00:00,jessewldn,"Making Uniswap Protocol's early DeFi innovation accessible via an intuitive, user-friendly front-end, at zero-cost, was critical to bootstrapping liquidity network effects."
766,2021-11-30 16:04:21+00:00,jessewldn,"Lets take Uniswap as an example:

Uniswap Labs, the company, built https://t.co/IrM9wf2NW9, the first interface to the Uniswap Protocol on Ethereum (can't be stopped.)"
767,2021-11-30 16:04:20+00:00,jessewldn,"Web3 teams building protocols are often first to build a product on top, and then...give it away for free. 

Like Web2, this helps bootstrap users, liquidity/data, and network effects of the underlying protocol. 

But in Web3, they won't stop."
768,2021-11-30 16:04:20+00:00,jessewldn,"Web3 projects have an opportunity to do things differently, owing to the fact that they can distribute tokens to turn their users into owners, empowering them to govern the platform in alignment with their continued interests."
769,2021-11-30 16:04:20+00:00,jessewldn,"Then they had to extract profits, so they stopped.  

Shifting their APIs from commodities to walled-gardens put them in zero-sum conflict with devs and the users who benefited from their creativity."
770,2021-11-30 16:04:20+00:00,jessewldn,"3/ Web2 social media platforms ran powerful, temporary versions of the strategy early in their growth phase:

By giving away their API, they commoditized their platform, attracting an ecosystem of developers who built businesses on top."

When those files are posted, a copy of the media is taken from the creator‚Äôs device and pasted to the server of the platform distributing it‚ÄîFacebook, Twitter, YouTube, TikTok and the like."
