1,2023-02-21 16:03:26+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"After working together for years on games such as Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, the team has reunited to build fun RPG gaming experiences with their unique approach to balancing the interests of traditional players, game developers, and crypto natives."
2,2023-02-21 16:03:23+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"We initially invested in @markotero and the @AzraGames team last May, and over the last nine months we’ve seen the seasoned games team he’s assembled execute in a world-class way to bring its first game @legions_legends to life."
3,2023-02-21 16:03:20+00:00,AriannaSimpson,The unique ownership and economic models of web3 combined with the “gameplay-comes-first philosophy” of @markotero and the team provides an incredible opportunity to take RPGs to the next level.
4,2023-02-21 16:03:19+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"We think the most engaging games of the future will incorporate web3 to empower their users, and that’s why today we’re thrilled to be deepening our investment in @AzraGames. https://t.co/RVxBA4AKnN"

9,2023-02-16 16:03:47+00:00,AriannaSimpson,Even the most sophisticated crypto users have a hard time ensuring their transactions are safe. @stelolabs UI makes it easier for people to explore web3 w/ confidence by putting all transactions &amp; signatures into plain English.

48,2022-10-31 00:31:39+00:00,AriannaSimpson,@mitch_troy It does encourage me to move more which is useful and i like the step tracking for the same reason. i’m also a sucker for gamification and closing the activity circles is good motivation
49,2022-10-31 00:30:46+00:00,AriannaSimpson,@mitch_troy The apple watch has a substantially shorter battery life (1 day vs 4/5 days) than the other two which makes it hard to wear overnight. the sleep measurements have always seemed less accurate to me. so overall if you want real data i wouldn’t recommend it.
50,2022-10-31 00:20:16+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"4) all in all the main function of these devices is telling you in more obvious terms what you already know: drinking is bad, going to bed early is good, sugar is bad, etc etc"
51,2022-10-31 00:20:16+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"3) whoop is best if you want to shit talk to your friends (well well, look who had a late night!). also best if you are training seriously and want to know which days you should push yourself harder. mostly useful if you’re not super in sync w your body and don’t already know."
52,2022-10-31 00:20:15+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"2) oura - best sleep tracking. consistent matches how i feel / perceived sleep experience better than the whoop. not at all social though, unlike whoop"
53,2022-10-31 00:20:15+00:00,AriannaSimpson,1) the only one that actually improves your metrics is the eight sleep. sleeping better is the real mvp and as such i highly recommend the eight sleep. it’ll lower your RHR and improve your HRV. the measurements are not as accurate as whoop/oura tho
54,2022-10-31 00:20:14+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"I have an oura, apple watch, whoop, and eight sleep, and after years of extensive research, have determined the following:"

243,2022-02-24 22:10:40+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"Btw - the reason email is superior IMO is that it's a lot harder to lose track of things. Between all the other 97 messaging platforms, it's really hard to stay on top of things if you talk to a lot of people. My SLA is usually either 12 seconds, or 2 years."
244,2022-02-24 22:08:16+00:00,AriannaSimpson,I wish people would stop trying to get rid of email and instead focus on making it better.

251,2022-02-11 23:14:16+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"Season 0: More updates will be made to the game based upon feedback. Depending on how Alpha goes, the game may transition SLP earning from Battles v2 into Origin during this season,  and Battles v2 will be shut down."
252,2022-02-11 23:14:16+00:00,AriannaSimpson,Alpha: the game will be available to everyone globally via Mavis Hub and Android APK.  Player feedback will be super important to help refine the game before the official release. There will be no token rewards disbursed during this phase.
253,2022-02-11 23:14:16+00:00,AriannaSimpson,Origin has been built from the ground up to be more approachable for a mainstream audience. Every new player will be given 3 Axies to ease onboarding. Let's dig into the timeline! 👇
254,2022-02-11 23:14:16+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"Big news from @AxieInfinity today! Origin (new game!) is going to be released at the end of Q1. It's going to have brand new interfaces, game mechanics, art, special effects, storylines, and an expansive onboarding experience."

265,2022-02-09 18:17:11+00:00,AriannaSimpson,I should note that @a16z doesn’t expect a direct return from this funding. We’re donating because a stronger Ethereum ecosystem will have huge benefits for the advancement of web3 as a whole.

1. Solidity (Slang, new dev compiler)
2. EVM tooling (Rethnet, a building block to create debugging tools)
3. Local dev environment (Hardhat, dev env that’s integrated end-to-end)
4. Ethereum connector library (a revamped web3.js)"

317,2022-01-25 21:35:12+00:00,AriannaSimpson,People can lend their assets to Breeder’s pools to earn staking rewards. They can earn shares of proceeds when new assets are purchased by guilds or on the open market.
318,2022-01-25 21:35:12+00:00,AriannaSimpson,BreederDAO is building tech dashboards and machine learning programs to identify the best times to “breed” or generate in-game assets. It's automating financial projections and investment strategies to make the process dead simple.
319,2022-01-25 21:35:11+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"That’s exactly the problem @BreederDAO aims to solve. If @YieldGuild addresses the player on-ramp, then @BreederDAO is easing asset supply."
320,2022-01-25 21:35:11+00:00,AriannaSimpson,Scholarships represent only a small percentage of the game’s DAUs. Why? Because there’s a BIG bottleneck between player demand and supply of in-game assets.
321,2022-01-25 21:35:10+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"To keep up with overwhelming demand, guilds such as @YieldGuild formed to sponsor players through revenue-sharing “scholarships.” Guilds rent their NFTs to players, or “scholars,” so more people can play and earn."

332,2022-01-24 19:06:32+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"One of the things I’m most excited about in 2022 is v2 of NFT utility. v1 allowed ownership over digitally scarce assets, plus some playability &amp; breeding capabilities. v2 will provide a richer landscape for interactive experiences, conferring more extensive rights to holders."
333,2022-01-24 16:55:25+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"In other words, don’t freak out, lol. Been doing this since 2013 and I promise the fundamentals haven’t changed. Keep building 😊💪🏼"
334,2022-01-24 16:47:27+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"As web3 becomes more mainstream (and therefore its base of holders starts to look more like that of equities and other asset classes), it’s not at all surprising that price activity may start to track other markets more closely."

374,2022-01-06 18:21:56+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"In just a few months, Goldfinch showed it’s filling a huge global need, growing from $250k to $38M+ in loan volume. 200k+ borrowers in 18 countries have used it for a wide range of services , such aseco-friendly cookstoves for low-income Indian households https://t.co/rzASHRfM14"
375,2022-01-06 18:21:55+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"Investors can utilize @goldfinch_fi by depositing crypto into the pool to earn yield. As the lending businesses make their interest payments back to the protocol, they’re immediately disbursed to all investors."
376,2022-01-06 18:21:55+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"In this way, the protocol provides the utility of crypto — specifically, its global access to capital — while leaving the actual loan origination and servicing to the businesses best equipped to handle it."
377,2022-01-06 18:21:54+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"It also makes off-chain sources of yield available and composable on DeFi. The protocol works by extending credit lines to lending businesses, which can then draw down stablecoins from the pool and deploy them on the ground in their local markets."
378,2022-01-06 18:21:54+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"Enter @goldfinch_fi: a decentralized credit platform that broadens the pool of potential lenders beyond just banks. The protocol operates as an open marketplace for loans without collateral, and decentralizes the loan underwriting process."
379,2022-01-06 18:21:53+00:00,AriannaSimpson,So borrowers who need access to credit the most – those who don’t already have substantial assets to lend against – are unable to benefit from most DeFi lenders. This limitation has especially hindered the adoption of DeFi lending in emerging markets.
380,2022-01-06 18:21:52+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"Most web3 lending protocols only support overcollateralized loans b/c it’s much easier to manage that risk.  But borrowers w collateral tend to be traders &amp; holders who don’t want to sell, while basically everyone else borrows money because they don’t have what they need."
381,2022-01-06 18:21:50+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"Undercollateralized lending has been one of the missing holy grails in defi for a while, and today I'm thrilled to announce we've led @goldfinch_fi's Series A as they tackle this

538,2021-11-22 17:44:13+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"Fun fact: Elena lived in Australia for 2.5 years during high school, but does not have the accent to prove it. Where do you stand on vegemite, @VirtualElena? The people need to know."

563,2021-11-11 15:16:04+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"There was obviously something there, but enough holes in it that a smart skeptic could pick it apart. The problem is that there are too many smart skeptics — it’s easy to point to all the reasons something might fail."

682,2021-10-05 11:43:59+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"In practice, scalability challenges of the technology that impacted speed and costs, not to mention several difficult crypto cycles, made it nearly impossible to build a new kind of decentralized game that more people could participate in."
683,2021-10-05 11:43:59+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"In theory, applying the values and ethos of the web3 space—reclaiming power and wealth from some of the platforms that have been historically extractive and distributing back to the people participating in these ecosystems—made a lot of sense for gaming."
684,2021-10-05 11:43:59+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"Crypto gaming has been for years considered a niche experience designed for a very small group of early adopters.

725,2021-09-23 16:17:43+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"@WuCarra's zest for learning and willingness to ask questions without being worried about looking foolish is absolutely critical for a young investor. I'd suggest getting to know her early (and giving her a follow), because she's definitely gmi!"
726,2021-09-23 16:17:43+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"Over the last several months, Carra has become an integral member of the team, building deep relationships across the industry and diving super deep into crypto. I have heard unprompted feedback from countless founders that she is incredibly helpful, curious, and sharp."
727,2021-09-23 16:17:42+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"There was a whole contingent of students who would take notes on her questions and then go over them during study sessions together, and that was how they got through the class."
728,2021-09-23 16:17:42+00:00,AriannaSimpson,It's not just Carra’s resume that impressed me. One of her classmates in a particularly thorny Econ class (with a reputation for being the hardest at Harvard) told us that everyone knew her because she would ask the questions everyone else was afraid to.
729,2021-09-23 16:17:41+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"Still, I was optimistic, and my secret plan was that if things went well we could convince her not to go back to Harvard (which luckily for us is exactly what happened)."
730,2021-09-23 16:17:40+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"Her email continued: would I consider bringing her onto the team as a crypto intern?Hm...an interesting idea!We'd never had one before.The thing with interns is YMMV extensively: the best are worth their weight in gold, while the less proactive cohort requires a lot of oversight."
731,2021-09-23 16:17:39+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"Before even finishing college (studying Applied Math, CS &amp; Econ at Harvard, nbd!), she had a more impressive resume than most people a decade into their career - myself included."
732,2021-09-23 16:17:38+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"Carra and I first connected at the beginning of this year when she cold emailed me. I get a lot of cold email, but hers immediately stood out: it was concise, thoughtful, and assertive without being pushy."

The product has over 200K users with a balance &amp; 53K monthly active users in over 100 countries."
850,2021-07-27 15:44:13+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"4/ At the same time, the rise of stablecoin markets and a growing number of fiat on/off ramps around the world has created the right environment to offer a great digital wallet in these regions not previously possible in crypto."
851,2021-07-27 15:44:13+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"3/ One of the earliest use-cases so many of us got excited about in crypto is borderless payments &amp; financial services for underserved communities in regions around the world. Existing options can be expensive, slow, and limited by region."
852,2021-07-27 15:44:13+00:00,AriannaSimpson,2/ We got to know @jackie_bona through her work at Celo Labs where she was Head of Consumer Growth. She's an exceptional founder who brings deep experience in consumer tech to building a product bringing crypto to communities around the world.

860,2021-07-21 17:11:48+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"5. I've even seen initial mocks for a DAO management platform specifically optimized around Zed, built by a member of the community. Most excitingly, the game is continuously evolving, and there's a huge amount more in store."
861,2021-07-21 17:11:48+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"4. The Discord (https://t.co/X21Hum0u4B) is bumping with activity users all around the world, and community members are putting together incredibly extensive guides for the game."
862,2021-07-21 17:11:47+00:00,AriannaSimpson,3.  It's been incredibly fun to watch the enthusiasm with which the community has embraced the ability to breed and race beautiful Zed horses. https://t.co/mHyzdI7Jd0

893,2021-07-14 17:34:38+00:00,AriannaSimpson,5. We're delighted to partner with Phantom as they build the next generation of crypto wallets! You can download the Phantom wallet here: https://t.co/i8n1QKOVKJ
894,2021-07-14 17:34:38+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"4. This is a non-trivial feat, but the founding team (@fragosti @BChillman and Chris Kalani, who oddly has no Twitter!) has the right background to tackle this: experience building products at 0x, Matcha, FB, &amp; Twitter ties together the best of Web2 + crypto native experience."
895,2021-07-14 17:34:37+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"3. Developing products with a focus on usability is key to onboarding the next wave of users into crypto, and designing experiences that are delightful and intuitive is a key part of Phantom's mission."
896,2021-07-14 17:34:37+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"2. As the number of blockchains has grown and we've transitioned to an increasingly cross-chain world, support for multiple chains is becoming a must. Phantom is starting off by supporting all major dApps in the Solana ecosystem, with plans for Ethereum and beyond later on."
897,2021-07-14 17:34:37+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"1. Thrilled to announce we at a16z crypto have led a round of financing in @Phantom, a beautifully-designed crypto wallet built for interacting with Web3 applications via a browser extension, optimized around DeFi and NFTs."

907,2021-06-24 12:32:07+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"2/ It certainly hasn’t been smooth sailing, but crypto feels inevitable now in a way that’s truly inspiring. Witnessing the rise of DeFi, the entrance of institutional players, &amp; the explosion of NFTs has been the ride of a lifetime."
908,2021-06-24 12:32:07+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"1/ When I first fell down the crypto rabbit hole 8 years ago after witnessing severe hyperinflation in Zimbabwe, it was very unclear whether crypto would survive, let alone reach the incredible scale &amp; milestones we’ve witnessed in the past year."

For the first time, DeFi users will be able to provide crypto loans directly to emerging market borrowers."
921,2021-06-16 15:46:32+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"4/Since launching a few months ago, the protocol has grown 2.5X with loans extended to borrowers across 7 countries: India, Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam."
922,2021-06-16 15:46:32+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"3/ Goldfinch is enabling *anyone* to be a lender, not just banks, and thus opening the door to give more people and business access to capital, starting in emerging markets. This bridges the tradfi and DeFi worlds in an exciting new way."
923,2021-06-16 15:46:31+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"2/ This is a critical part of the decentralized financial stack to solve: in order for the industry to reach its full potential, it's important that we move toward greater capital efficiency. That comes in the form of un- or undercollateralized loans."
924,2021-06-16 15:46:31+00:00,AriannaSimpson,1/I'm thrilled to announce that @a16z crypto has led a round of financing in @goldfinch_fi. @katie_haun and I couldn't be more excited to partner with @sall and @_blakewest + team as they tackle one of the most important unsolved problems in DeFi today: undercollateralized loans

1401,2019-12-19 17:06:41+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"@Hasu @_prestwich @bcmakes 16/ Networks currently trust in economics; in the future, networks will trust in cryptography. 
 
 Cryptoeconomics might be just be a bandage, a short term fix to help bootstrap the crypto ecosystem until cryptography can provide real security."
1402,2019-12-19 17:06:40+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"@Hasu @_prestwich @bcmakes 15/ With ZKPs, centralization in staking networks no longer becomes a huge issue, as the value a validator can extract from an attack is decreased significantly."
1403,2019-12-19 17:06:40+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"@Hasu @_prestwich @bcmakes 14/ There may only be one way to truly secure these networks long-term — Zero-knowledge Proofs. 
 
 Rather than relying on economic mechanisms to keep validators honest, ZKPs make it impossible for validators to perform malicious behaviors like producing an invalid block."
1404,2019-12-19 17:06:40+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"@Hasu @_prestwich @bcmakes 13/ It's looking increasingly like centralization in staking may be inevitable. 
 
 If this is the case, bribery for chain reorganization (i.e. Binance hack) &amp; censorship may always be within the realm of possibility."
1405,2019-12-19 17:06:40+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"@Hasu @_prestwich @bcmakes 12/ These mechanisms may help discourage centralization but ultimately won't stop it. Validators will find ways around these rules. (e.g. running multiple nodes, ignoring out-of-protocol 'rules')"
1406,2019-12-19 17:06:39+00:00,AriannaSimpson,@Hasu @_prestwich @bcmakes 11/ C) Incentivize delegating to smaller validators — ex. Polkadot's Nominated PoS (NPoS) that distributes rewards to validators evenly regardless of stake. This helps small validators bootstrap delegation.
1407,2019-12-19 17:06:39+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"@Hasu @_prestwich @bcmakes 10/ What can be done to combat centralization in PoS? 
 
 A) Social consensus around min. staking fee — 'require' validators charge a sustainable fee. 
 
 B) Anti-correlation penalties — slashing that rises in proportion to the amount of stake that misbehaves in the same period."
1408,2019-12-19 17:06:39+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"@Hasu @_prestwich @bcmakes 9/ In the context of PoS, this means slashing must be used to impose a cost on misbehavior. Without slashing, validators have little ""commitment"" to the network. 
 
 Networks w lower slashing may tend to be less secure, and it seems unlikely that a slashless PoS could be secure."
1409,2019-12-19 17:06:39+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"8/ To have true security, the economics have to check out for any single entity: 
 
 profit(honestValidation) &gt; profit(attack) 
 
 @Hasu, @_prestwich, and @bcmakes use this intuition in their model of Bitcoin economics. See here: https://t.co/rlBqm0BUu6"
1410,2019-12-19 17:06:38+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"7/ What does this mean for PoS security? 
 
 Well, we can't rely on honest &amp; uncoordinated majority assumptions to drive security — collusion must be assumed to be possible and probable."
1411,2019-12-19 17:06:38+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"6/ Even in an efficient validator market, stake concentrates to a few large validators who utilize reputation and scale to drive smaller validators out of the market. 
 
 Binance using unsustainably low fees to undercut the market is the latest example of this."
1412,2019-12-19 17:06:38+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"5/ Validators have 3 ways to differentiate: 
 
 1. Pre-existing reputation 
 
 2. Fees — offer higher return to delegators 
 
 3. Differentiated services (i.e. offer better staking experience or additional crypto services)"
1413,2019-12-19 17:06:37+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"4/ So why is stake concentrating? A big part of this is the inefficiency in delegation markets. 
 
 On paper, validators look the same, so delegators crowd into a few validators with a large amount of stake, decent track record, and low fees. 
 
 Power laws take over."
1414,2019-12-19 17:06:37+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"3/ When stake becomes concentrated, collusion becomes a real risk. ""Trustless"" networks are replaced with networks that only trust a few. True censorship-resistance arguably goes away."
1415,2019-12-19 17:06:37+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"2/ Running a validator well is hard &amp; requires technical expertise — it's definitely not for everyone, so we let users delegate their stake to other people running validators. 
 
 But this is causing stake to gravitate toward a small number of publicly-known validators."
1416,2019-12-19 17:06:37+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"1/ Coinbase adds automatic staking for XTZ, and less than a month later, Binance introduces 0% staking fees on Tezos. 
 
 Stake wars are just getting started, and things are already starting to feel a liiittle uncomfortable.

1436,2019-12-09 18:02:41+00:00,AriannaSimpson,The main complaint the banks are making is that they worry the new secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) could notch outsize drops at times of economic stress. Banks might then have to lend at low rates at times when their own borrowing costs are rising.

 The average gamer doesn’t care about asset ownership or trading (and for those who do, these somewhat exist already). These people won't be trading off fun/UX for crypto."
1486,2019-11-25 20:03:55+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"@JacobPPhillips 15/ And 1 broad observation: Trust in gaming is not broken. 
 
 GCs don’t flood the market with assets or delete user accounts. Popular 3rd party sites aren’t stealing assets or scamming people, and gamers aren’t particularly cynical of the GCs who control the gaming experience."
1487,2019-11-25 20:03:55+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"@JacobPPhillips 14/ Third, right now, trading probably makes games less fun. 
 
 The ability to trade in-game assets for $ creates a huge incentive for hackers to exploit the centralized entities controlling asset issuance and trading. Widespread cheating undermines the integrity of the game."
1488,2019-11-25 20:03:55+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"@JacobPPhillips 13/ Second, there is clear demand for markets around in-game assets. 
 
 Many gamers have been persistent in their pursuit of this practice. They routinely work around (or outright defy) the rules to allow for suitable asset trading. It's clear that the demand is here to stay."
1489,2019-11-25 20:03:55+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"@JacobPPhillips 12/ From this, what can we observe about trading? 
 
 First, trading is a cool feature but not a fundamental driver of gameplay. Games have disabled trading with virtually no impact on DAU. 
 
 Above all, gamers just want to have fun."
1490,2019-11-25 20:03:54+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"@JacobPPhillips 11/ Many gamers use 3rd party trading sites to reduce fees &amp; enable cashing out to USD. When gamers use 3rd party sites, GCs are unable to profit. 
 
 These sites are more risky — users often have to share account info, opening door to scams (e.g. site steals all your assets)."
1491,2019-11-25 20:03:54+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"@JacobPPhillips 10/ Some games permit asset trading. GCs capture value through trading fees on official exchanges. 
 
 Steam is the most popular exchange. Gamers who trade here are charged ~15% commission per trade. Gamers can load USD to buy assets on Steam but can’t cash out to USD post trade."
1492,2019-11-25 20:03:54+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"@JacobPPhillips 8/ Side note: the loot box model has been deemed gambling in some places. This model becomes more gambling-like when paired with an out-of-game market to trade assets for $$$. 
 
 Some assets trade for many $100's, even $1000's, of dollars."
1493,2019-11-25 20:03:53+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"@JacobPPhillips 7/ GCs issue in-game assets primarily in 2 ways: 
 
 1. In-game store — Users pay $ for items. Unlimited supply, but assets are only available at certain times. 
 
 2. Loot boxes — Users pay $ for random items. GCs manage probabilities that items are released (limited supply)."
1494,2019-11-25 20:03:53+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"@JacobPPhillips 6/ In the world of in-game assets, GCs are the central bank. They can mint, destroy, restrict, or alter assets at anytime. Gamers don't own assets, and assets can only exchanged if allowed by the GCs."
1495,2019-11-25 20:03:53+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"@JacobPPhillips 5/ When you look at the numbers, in-game assets are a BIG deal. Take Fortnite, for example: 
 
 - $2.4bn in revenue, almost all from in-game assets 
 - 70% of users buy in-game assets 
 - Average spending per user = $85"
1496,2019-11-25 20:03:52+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"@JacobPPhillips 4/ The economics here seem to make sense: People are more likely to make multiple small purchases than one large purchase. 
 
 Plus, the game is free — why not spend a few bucks to make it more fun?"
1497,2019-11-25 20:03:52+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"@JacobPPhillips 3/ In the FtP model, game creators (GCs) make money by selling/issuing in-game assets. 
 
 These assets don't improve performance. Skins, outfits, accessories, and other assets are purely cosmetic. Gamers use these as a form of expression — to look cool and signal expertise."
1498,2019-11-25 20:03:52+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"@JacobPPhillips 2/ But in 2009, League of Legends launched with a free-to-play (FtP) monetization model. 
 
 Dota then became FtP in 2012. Fortnite's FtP game launched in 2017 — leading CS-GO and PUBG to release FtP versions in early 2019. 
 
 5 of the top 6 games are now FtP."
1499,2019-11-25 20:03:52+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"@JacobPPhillips 1/ The gaming industry has undergone a rapid shift. The early 2000s were dominated by play-then-play gaming — i.e. pay $ to buy game, then play as much of you'd like. Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, Fifa, etc. all used this model."
1500,2019-11-25 20:03:51+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"0/ My team (esp @JacobPPhillips!) and I have been thinking a lot about gaming as a way to usher in a new wave of people to crypto. We're going to need that if this industry is to become more than the same group of people talking at one another.

1603,2019-10-14 17:42:55+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"@zcash @avichal 10/ Rationale for 1 seat to ECC, 1 to ZF: Zcash is ECC's brainchild; they've amassed an R&amp;D team that is 2nd to none. ZF has been huge in pushing adoption. We should welcome ECC &amp; ZF leadership. If they fail expectations, we have an simple &amp; formal way to replace them."
1604,2019-10-14 17:42:54+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"@zcash @avichal 9/ Rationale for 5-person council: this strikes a good balance between centralization and decentralization. We get quick, flexible funding with broad representation of interests. A council of people is better than entities because they're easier to replace."
1605,2019-10-14 17:42:54+00:00,AriannaSimpson,@zcash @avichal 8/ Rationale for 20% of block reward for dev fund: this should be enough to fund development. Underfunding poses an existential threat to Zcash. Overfunding is slightly inefficient. Better to be safe than sorry.
1606,2019-10-14 17:42:54+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"@zcash @avichal 7/ ASP rec's accepting Avichal’s proposal with two revisions: 
 1. In the initial allocation, 1 seat is reserved for an ECC rep., 1 seat is for a ZF rep, and 3 seats are for ZEC holders to vote on. 
 2. Staggered elections. Every 6 mo's, 1 seat should be put up for a vote."
1607,2019-10-14 17:42:54+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"@zcash @avichal 6/ Avichal’s key points are: 
 1. 20% of BR to Dev Fund. 
 2. 5-person council is created and has full authority over funds. 
 3. 1 seat on the council is for a miner rep. 1 seat is for a ZEC holder rep., and the remaining 3 seats can be anyone. 
 4. Elections every 2 years."
1608,2019-10-14 17:42:53+00:00,AriannaSimpson,@zcash 5/ ASP's positioning most closely aligns with @avichal's proposal: https://t.co/qMXQNzbu4f.
1609,2019-10-14 17:42:53+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"@zcash 4/ Here's what's still being debated: 
 1. How large should the Dev Fund be, and how should it be funded? 
 2. How will the Dev Fund be managed? 
 3. How will the Zcash community ensure transparency and accountability of the managers of the fund?"
1610,2019-10-14 17:42:53+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"@zcash 3/ Here's what the community agrees on: 
 1. The FR should be allowed to expire. 
 2. There should be a fund for ongoing development (Dev Fund). 
 3. We need great transparency and accountability. 
 4. More input from Zcash community is needed on how funds are distributed."
1611,2019-10-14 17:42:53+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"@zcash 2/ 20% of each block reward (BR) is paid to the FR. 
 But this is set to expire at the first BR halving in 2020, at which point all the BR will go to miners"
1612,2019-10-14 17:42:53+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"@zcash 1/ Quick background for those who aren't familiar with the FR discussion: The Zcash FR is a fund used to reward Zcash founders, early employees, and investors. FR funds are also used to fund ongoing development through the Electric Coin Company (ECC) &amp; Zcash Foundation (ZF)"

1703,2019-09-19 01:52:46+00:00,AriannaSimpson,9. Parking your capital in a high interest-generating account (i.e. DeFi) is ultimately taking a different path toward solving for the same issue. So to pit ethereum and bitcoin against one another is to majorly miss the big picture.
1704,2019-09-19 01:52:45+00:00,AriannaSimpson,8. Ray Dalio did a terrific job of laying out the case for us but missed by a fraction of an inch when he landed on gold as the solution: more here https://t.co/90bwvGbC0b
1705,2019-09-19 01:52:45+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"7. In this kind of a macro environment, holding bitcoin is a hedge against the failings of fiat currencies."
1706,2019-09-19 01:52:45+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"6. There is no sign of a reversal, either: the ECB cut its deposit rate by 10 basis points last week to a record low of -0.5% and markets are signaling they don't expect a reversion for a decade."
1707,2019-09-19 01:52:45+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"5. DeFi is offering this environment which has become exceedingly rare at the macro level. In traditional capital markets - interest rates are often no longer just low but now even negative, a logical impossibility which is becoming increasingly common in much of the world."
1708,2019-09-19 01:52:45+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"4. The minimum environment people are looking for is the ability to break even (interest rate ≥ inflation rate) but ideally, one where interest rate &gt; inflation rate."
1709,2019-09-19 01:52:44+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"3. Interest (and relatedly, leverage) has been emerging as the initial killer app of DeFi. They are two sides of the same coin. It comes down to *not having your money vanish* over a period of time."
1710,2019-09-19 01:52:44+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"2. Bitcoin is called ""sound money"" - capped, limited supply, known quantity, resistant to inflation. It is particularly attractive as a counter to hyper-inflationary monetary regimes."

1721,2019-09-16 14:44:58+00:00,AriannaSimpson,2/ I would not have anticipated that it would be a corporate issuer who would trigger the panic that is currently gripping several European countries about Facebook’s Libra.
1722,2019-09-16 14:44:58+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"1/ The potential for crypto assets to threaten the sovereignty of nations by replacing state-run currencies has been a key part of the significance of crypto for me from day one (in my case, early 2013)."

1796,2019-08-26 20:42:29+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"@aweissman @amandapetrusich “friskiness, conviviality, and youthful nonchalance” — excellent line"
1797,2019-08-26 20:13:56+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"11/ On the whole, I remain extremely excited and optimistic about what other chains will bring to the table. But being glib about the risks involved strikes me as a recipe for disaster. As usual, never a dull moment in crypto.... 🙃"
1798,2019-08-26 20:13:56+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"10/ As if that weren't enough, as new chains become more complex, the surface area for vulnerabilities becomes dramatically larger. It's easier to have bugs, and easier for malicious actors to exploit those issues - and as discussed, there's more incentive to do so."
1799,2019-08-26 20:13:55+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"9/ And part of it is just about the money - if you've raised 100M +, people are going to expect that your chain has its shit together at time of launch. In this kind of environment, the iterative process is much tougher."
1800,2019-08-26 20:13:55+00:00,AriannaSimpson,8/ Developer expectations are (rightly) much higher today than they were when bitcoin or even ethereum launched. Part of that is projects today should be able to benefit from and build on prior art.
1801,2019-08-26 20:13:55+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"7/ The environment today looks very different, and is much more antagonistic. There are 10s if not 100s of millions of dollars to be made by attacking top chains, and that # is rising."
1802,2019-08-26 20:13:55+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"6/ If syphoning off bitcoin only netted you a few hundred bucks, it would hardly be worth the trouble. This let bitcoin develop into a robust state by the time it started getting more attention."
1803,2019-08-26 20:13:55+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"5/ This was actually a terrific stroke of luck - since approximately 4 people cared, few eyes were upon it, and almost nobody was trying to attack the chain. In bitcoin's early years, there was basically no financial incentive to break it."
1804,2019-08-26 20:13:54+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"4/ While we'd all like to think that bitcoin came into the world fully formed, perfect, and entirely bugless, that's not the case. What happened is that bitcoin launched into relative oblivion (read: general sentiment was IDGAF)."
1805,2019-08-26 20:13:54+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"3/ There are many classes of users here. Mainly for L1 chains I'm talking about developers, as they will ultimately be the ones to decide, via voting with their feet, which chain(s) win."
1806,2019-08-26 20:13:54+00:00,AriannaSimpson,2/ The history of software development shows that building in a vacuum and expecting to come out with the perfect solution basically never works. Development is an iterative process which often involves many false starts and should have user feedback at its core.
1807,2019-08-26 20:13:54+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"1/ As we get closer to the launch of a number of Layer 1 chains that raised big money in 2017 and early 2018, I've been thinking a lot about what those launches are going to look like and whether they will pan out as early investors might have hoped."

1820,2019-08-21 21:32:53+00:00,AriannaSimpson,@alpacasw @danheld just because that happened before does not mean that it will happen again. if you look at the history of the internet -  a ton of businesses that did not work in v1 ended up working later. see webvan vs instacart etc etc
1821,2019-08-21 21:18:29+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"9/ So in sum, I believe claims that ""alts are dead"" and bitcoin alone will make it are nonsensical. I am most definitely long BTC. But call me after you've tried deploying an app on bitcoin versus ethereum -- alternative chains might not seem so useless after all! 🙃"
1822,2019-08-21 21:18:13+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"8 / I actually don't believe many other cryptoassets are even directly competitive with BTC -- if it captures the ""digital gold"" category, there is no reason other cryptonetworks cannot own other categories (compute, storage, etc etc)."
1823,2019-08-21 21:18:12+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"7/ But given the numerous high caliber of teams who are building crypto networks, I think it is incredibly unlikely that over a period of several years the entire rest of the market amounts to nothing. Not to mention, other chains will serve different functions!"
1824,2019-08-21 21:18:12+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"6/ Anyone who knows me (or has followed me on twitter for more than 5 minutes) is aware of how bullish I am on BTC. If I could only hold a single asset, BTC would be it."
1825,2019-08-21 21:18:12+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"5/ In reality, ETH was a better performing investment for many (even when considering the major correction of 2018!) than BTC was. So BTC remains king, but discounting everything else is silly."
1826,2019-08-21 21:18:12+00:00,AriannaSimpson,4/ Those who have been in this space for many years should recall that this is by no means the first time the pendulum has swung back and forth -- in 2017 bitcoin was old news and it was all the shiny new layer1s that were going to take over the world.
1827,2019-08-21 21:18:11+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"3/ Why? First off, there is a strong recency bias in the crypto community (and in the investing world at large, tbh). Just because something has been the case lately does not mean that will persist in perpetuity."
1828,2019-08-21 21:18:11+00:00,AriannaSimpson,2/ BTC has clearly outperformed most other cryptoassets by a wide margin YTD. Expecting that this will always be the case (or that holding only BTC is the right move) strikes me as foolish.
1829,2019-08-21 21:18:11+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"1/ The general crypto narrative seems to be drifting back to bitcoin maximalism, so I wanted to share a few thoughts on bitcoin relative to the rest of the crypto market:"

1847,2019-08-14 21:02:47+00:00,AriannaSimpson,Or maybe the story is that it’s non-correlated? Turns out we have insufficient data to credibly make either claim.

1895,2019-07-29 23:01:22+00:00,AriannaSimpson,@LeoMorozovskii @NeuronJimmy @latetot You’re wrong. Partial collateralization exists
1896,2019-07-29 22:52:10+00:00,AriannaSimpson,@LeoMorozovskii @NeuronJimmy @latetot Over collateralized means collateralized more than the borrowed principal

1930,2019-07-22 13:23:23+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"@CeloHQ 12/ I have been incredibly impressed by the speed and caliber of execution I have seen from the Celo team. It takes a village, though, so we'd love your participation."
1931,2019-07-22 13:23:23+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"@CeloHQ 11/ To make rapid development &amp; iteration possible after launch, Celo uses an on-chain governance protocol for upgrading itself using a straightforward mechanism that rewards users for participation."
1932,2019-07-22 13:23:23+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"@CeloHQ 10/ For the technically minded: Celo removes the need to check every header before a received header can be trusted. Performance will also improved with BLS signature aggregation and succinct zero-knowledge proofs, via zk-SNARKs."
1933,2019-07-22 13:23:23+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"@CeloHQ 9/ Data connectivity is often poor, and expensive, so Celo provides fast, secure sync between mobile devices and the network. Even wallet users with high latency, low bandwidth, or high cost data tariffs can use it."
1934,2019-07-22 13:23:22+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"@CeloHQ 8/ This design allows for people to send payments to people that are not yet on the protocol (in a fully decentralized manner), which is awesome as it helps grow the community natively."

1936,2019-07-22 13:23:22+00:00,AriannaSimpson,@CeloHQ 6/ Concepts like wallet addresses are confusing and users prefer using phone numbers — Celo maintains a decentralized on-chain PKI that maps hashes of phone numbers to public keys so that users can easily find each other via phone number.
1937,2019-07-22 13:23:22+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"@CeloHQ 5/ To keep it simple, txn fees must be payable in the asset being sent — Celo supports paying for gas using these stable assets (in addition to the native asset), and support for new assets that follow the ERC-20 standard can be added easily via on-chain governance."
1938,2019-07-22 13:23:21+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"@CeloHQ 4/ Stability relative to local or strong reference fiat currency (e.g. USD) is critical, so Celo uses its own algo stability protocol that supports a family of stable digital assets (pegged to local and global currencies), all backed by the same crypto-asset reserve."
1939,2019-07-22 13:23:21+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"@CeloHQ 3/ This lead them to some very specific design decisions, including the following:"

2201,2019-04-16 17:52:14+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"17/ One drawback of the platform is that its automated market making mechanism makes it so that the larger a trade, the more price slippage occurs. The platform works well for smaller trades, but this makes it somewhat unusable for larger ones."
2202,2019-04-16 17:52:14+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"16/ Worth nothing also that Uniswap is very gas efficient. It uses almost 10x less gas than Bancor in ETH to ERC20 trades (440,000 vs 46,000 gas), and can perform ERC20 to ERC20 trades more efficiently than 0x (113,000 vs 88,000 gas)."
2203,2019-04-16 17:52:14+00:00,AriannaSimpson,15/  This goes into the liquidity reserves to ensure that the total reserve size in the exchange contract continually grows with each trade. The fees also serve as a payout to liquidity providers when they withdraw their holdings of the reserves.
2204,2019-04-16 17:52:14+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"14/ When this happens, the provider's ETH and tokens are withdrawn at the current exchange rate (reserve ratio), rather than the ratio of their original investment. Uniswap itself does not take any commissions, but each txn by users is charged a 0.3% liquidity provider fee."
2205,2019-04-16 17:51:18+00:00,AriannaSimpson,13/Liquidity tokens are ERC20 tokens themselves and are specific to a single exchange pair (there is no uniform native token for the platform). Providers can burn their liquidity tokens at any time to withdraw their proportional shares of ETH and ERC20 tokens from the reserves.
2206,2019-04-16 17:51:18+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"12/ When deposits occur, liquidity tokens (LTs) are created for the provider, so they can earn passive income from lending their coins to the reserves. LTs track the proportion of total reserves that each liquidity provider has contributed."
2207,2019-04-16 17:51:17+00:00,AriannaSimpson,10/ But how does this actually work? Liquidity is added to exchange contracts via liquidity providers depositing equivalent values of ETH and ERC20 tokens into them.
2208,2019-04-16 17:50:27+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"9/ This pooled model smooths out the order book and allows for narrower spreads, requiring less active management on the part of market makers. Set it and forget it, FTW! (For more on the upsides of a pooled model, see @alexhevans's recent piece: 
https://t.co/28dnwTx2GI)"
2209,2019-04-16 17:50:26+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"8/ For example, if an ERC20 token is being sold for ETH, the size of that token's
reserve in its exchange contract increases and the ETH reserve decreases. The mechanism shifts the reserve ratio to increase the price of the ETH relative to the token for future txns."
2210,2019-04-16 17:50:26+00:00,AriannaSimpson,7/ The constant product market maker formula calculates the exchange rate at which a trade will be executed based on the size of the transaction and the amount the incoming trade will shift this ratio.
2211,2019-04-16 17:50:26+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"5/ Each of these contracts holds reserves of both ETH and the respective ERC20 token, creating an internal liquidity reserve. Trades are executed directly against these reserves. Exchange contracts are linked through the registry, allowing for direct token to token trades via ETH"
2212,2019-04-16 17:49:18+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"4/ What's novel about it? Most exchanges maintain an order book and facilitate
matches between buyers and sellers, but Uniswap doesn't. The protocol is composed of an ETH-ERC20 exchange smart contract for each ERC20 token on the platform."
2213,2019-04-16 17:49:18+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"3/ Uniswap is open source, has no native token or platform fee and no incentives or special treatment awarded to early adopters or developers. Listing tokens is free and all smart contract functions are public."
2214,2019-04-16 17:49:18+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"2/ First off, what is it? It's a protocol for automated exchange of ERC20
tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. It prioritizes decentralization and security and has eliminated rent extraction and censorship, enabling faster and more efficient exchange."
2215,2019-04-16 17:49:18+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"1/ What's happening in @UniswapExchange land? A thread about the #3 DeFi platform, by collateral locked. We're all learning here, so if I misinterpreted or misunderstood anything feel free to chime in (politely, please):"

2217,2019-04-15 15:32:19+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"@atlantatech Yes. The idea is that MMs will be able to ""rent"" tokens from holders so they don't have to have full risk exposure or too much capital up front. But there will be a bonus for those who actually own"
2218,2019-04-15 15:27:48+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"6/ I am still digging into the nitty gritty of ZEIP-31, but so far it looks like a very strong proposal to solve for some of the issues the protocol has encountered thus far. Huge props to Peter Zeitz, @abandeali1, @willwarren89 &amp; team. 

Disclosure: My fund holds ZRX."
2219,2019-04-15 15:27:47+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"5/All of the above aligns incentives so that MMs both stake *and* provide liquidity, which should help reconcile the issue of tokenholders being distinct from traders, as they mostly are now. https://t.co/fzrTa7ZBDR"
2220,2019-04-15 15:27:47+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"4(c)/ Last but not least, you benefit as a MM whether you are big or small. MMs don’t benefit from forming a coalition or multiple identities. Conversely, small MMs aren’t at a disadvantage, unlike on most exchanges which only extend discounts or subsidies to high-volume traders."
2221,2019-04-15 15:27:47+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"4(b)/ If you stake ZRX, your reward will increase as you supply more liquidity. If you supply liquidity, your reward will increase as you stake more ZRX. Wash trading and faking volume becomes very expensive."
2222,2019-04-15 15:27:47+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"4(a)/ They use a thing called a Cobb-Douglas production function to calculate liquidity rewards, which has a number of nifty attributes, including the following: If you provide zero liquidity, you earn zero reward. If you stake zero ZRX tokens, you earn zero reward."
2223,2019-04-15 15:27:46+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"3/ The math behind the liquidity function in particular is, to use a strictly technical term, really fucking cool. Why, you wonder? So glad you asked!"
2224,2019-04-15 15:27:46+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"2/ You should go read the whole thing here, but I'll put out a few important takeaways in this thread, specifically starting with the liquidity function: https://t.co/baq4k43h4j"
2225,2019-04-15 15:27:46+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"1/ ICYMI, @0xProject released ZEIP-31 last week, which is a proposal for a new set of stake-based liquidity incentives. It's a very comprehensive plan designed to incentivize market makers to provide liquidity, ensure broad participation from the community &amp; more."

2239,2019-04-11 14:04:21+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"@delitzer @danzuller @bennybitcoins Well, across the board they do increase the cost of borrow. There may be edge cases where that doesn’t apply but in general yes."

2247,2019-04-11 04:08:56+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"@bennybitcoins Hmmm yes and no. The point is that regardless, this is also pushing up the compound APR. which means eventually there should be a threshold where it no longer makes sense to take out the loan. This is actually bullish for maker because it means it should remain the cheapest"

2293,2019-03-27 17:05:35+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"4/ What’s the incentive system?

2338,2019-03-21 16:39:48+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"4/ Occasionally you’ll encounter an asshole who doesn’t behave this way, but on average people really are hoping you’ll succeed(I assure you the jerks are just insecure). It’s a much more comfortable view of the world — and when you’re at ease, you’ll be more likely to deliver!"
2339,2019-03-21 16:39:47+00:00,AriannaSimpson,3/ The same is true if you’re a founder going into a fundraising conversation. Investor mtgs can be nerve wracking (especially pitching a whole partnership) but think about it — they are all hoping you’ll be the best company they’ve ever seen! It’s literally why they’re there.
2340,2019-03-21 16:39:47+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"3/ When I was younger I used to get very nervous before speaking in public, but once I reframed it in this way, it became much more appealing thing to do. A whole room full of supporters listening! What an awesome thing to have."
2341,2019-03-21 16:39:46+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"2/ Public speaking is a great example. Most people fear it more than death (seriously, they’ve done studies) but in reality, think about it: when someone goes to hear a talk, they don’t want it to suck! They are literally invested in your success."
2342,2019-03-21 16:39:45+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"1/ The world becomes a much more pleasant place when you realize that most people are actually rooting for your success. It might not always be obvious, but it’s true:"

2471,2019-02-26 00:56:23+00:00,AriannaSimpson,7/ Can anyone point to any research on this? Very curious what studies have been done on this concept.
2472,2019-02-26 00:56:23+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"6/ It seems to me that learning by topic, (i.e. for several weeks JUST learn about cell biology, then move on to history of WW2)by combining different formats of learning -- videos, lectures, reading multiple books on the subject etc would be a MUCH more effective way to do it."
2473,2019-02-26 00:56:22+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"5/ But school, esp pre-college, does the opposite! Students are constantly being shuffled between different classes, which are generally no more than an hour. So you never go very deep on anything. Everything stays in the short/medium term category of surface-level understanding."
2474,2019-02-26 00:56:22+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"4/ If you go super deep on something for an extended period, it transfers from ""think I remember now but could forget"" to something that you really KNOW. The latter is much more valuable as it's basically permanently rather than temporarily held in memory."
2475,2019-02-26 00:56:22+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"3/ The key part of the process is that I am TOTALLY focused on learning one thing, and one thing only. I am increasingly convinced that context switching is the enemy of deep understanding."
2476,2019-02-26 00:56:22+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"2/ plus what others have written, watching videos, etc. Then I usually find founders or people who know way more about it than I do and ask them questions until i feel like I get it. Then I explain it to somebody else (either live or in a memo / LP letter) to confirm I get it."
2477,2019-02-26 00:56:22+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"2/ How I currently learn about a new topic (i.e. how predictions markets work, or how Uniswap works) is by doing a complete deep dive for a few days, or in some cases longer, until I feel like I really understand it. This meanings reading source material like whitepapers ..(cont)"
2478,2019-02-26 00:56:22+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"1/ In thinking about how I currently learn best, I am coming to the alarming realization that I think the entire education system is structured incorrectly for enhancing long-term memory and understanding. A few thoughts:"

2496,2019-02-22 23:42:54+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"3) Also as a couple of folks have pointed out in the thread, the 13% liquidation fee also needs to be factored in."

2499,2019-02-22 23:36:06+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"2) it also strikes me as very unlikely that the stability fee (which is very low at 0.5% annually now) will remain there. As the stability fee rises that should cause more MKR to be burned, reducing supply which should presumably drive up prices"
2500,2019-02-22 23:36:05+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"1.1) as such, I think we are more likely to see either exponential growth OR death of the project entirely than we are to see sustained linear growth."
2501,2019-02-22 23:36:05+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"1) the idea that Dai supply is going to remain linear strikes me as very, very unlikely. I would expect demand to increase substantially relative to what it had been, especially when you factor in that we are in a serious bear market."

2557,2019-02-12 17:22:23+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"8)Library: the library is such an awesome and under appreciated resource. It eliminates cost from the equation and allows you to experiment more (if you don’t like the book, no pressure to finish cause you paid for it!)Just move on."
2558,2019-02-12 17:22:23+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"7) Set ambitious goals: # of books per year, # of minutes per day etc. Even if you don’t hit them you’ll likely read much more than you would have otherwise."
2559,2019-02-12 17:22:22+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"6) Interest: i only read things that genuinely interest me. Fortunately for me that’s a wide array, but everyone can find something they love to read. If you haven’t found it, keep looking!"
2560,2019-02-12 17:22:22+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"5) Block time: if you feel like you don’t have enough time, literally block it off on your calendar. Most of my best ideas have come from reading (often outside of my professional arena). Amazing how things transfer and you can recombine ideas in original ways."
2561,2019-02-12 17:22:22+00:00,AriannaSimpson,4) Style: I own a kindle but don’t love it. Tried to make myself like it for years (and consequently read less) but eventually gave up. I find my retention is way worse on Kindle. Find what works for you!
2562,2019-02-12 17:22:20+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"3) Preparedness: I bought this handy little book light that I have in my bag all the time and use to read whenever it’s dark, especially in Ubers at night. It’s rechargeable and lasts forever. So nerdy but I love it! https://t.co/cEEnFduanJ"
2563,2019-02-12 17:22:18+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"2) Variety: I keep lots of books on hand, and am generally reading 2-4 at a time, of different genres. Alternating allows me to pick whatever suits my mood at the moment (sometimes I’m too tired for non fiction but fiction is perfect, etc)."
2564,2019-02-12 17:22:18+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"1) Availability: I always, always have a book on me. Down time becomes time to read rather than mindlessly browsing Instagram. Added plus: any delay is much less of a nuisance since I can make productive use of time."
2565,2019-02-12 17:22:16+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"After my last thread on books, I got a lot of questions about how I read so much. So, a thread: 🤓 📚✨"
2566,2019-02-11 14:14:38+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"3)Even more importantly, it misses the fact that you can DO anything with a token other than use it as a digital representation of a share. If that’s all tokens end up being, we will have failed greatly as an industry. Odds of this are ~0 since we are already beyond that."
2567,2019-02-11 14:14:37+00:00,AriannaSimpson,2)The idea that if you’re investing in tokens you’re a short-term investor is nonsense. There often was NOT the option to invest in a “regular” round. Many great teams raised only in tokens and investors went with it. https://t.co/ZYEz2PbCsF
2568,2019-02-11 14:14:34+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"1)This article makes some fair points, but this sentence means the authors have *completely* missed the point of tokens (screenshot on next tweet)."

2584,2019-02-01 17:28:11+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"@bendavenport @barbaraliau @SFPublicLibrary No, not the first time. I had previously set mine at 50, and hit it. But I used to read like 300 books a year. I tend to gravitate toward the goal, whatever it is, so my assumption is even if i “fail” I will have read a lot more than I would have otherwise, so it’s a win"
2585,2019-02-01 17:26:28+00:00,AriannaSimpson,@jkadis The important stuff sticks! I use the Highlighter app now which is awesome but have never been much of a note taker
2586,2019-02-01 17:24:28+00:00,AriannaSimpson,@WarcMeinstein @SFPublicLibrary Medium absolutely matters. Books require far more concentration and deeper concentration than short form content. There’s also a lot of research suggesting audio isn’t as well retained as written content (which I know is very true for me personally)
2587,2019-02-01 04:22:10+00:00,AriannaSimpson,@barbaraliau @SFPublicLibrary I’m super numerically-driven so I attach specific goals to everything haha. Let me know how it goes! 😊

2590,2019-02-01 04:15:34+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"@barbaraliau @SFPublicLibrary I tend to read in the early mornings and evenings. I also always have a book with me so if there’s a delay, I’m in an Uber etc I can read"

2599,2019-02-01 01:58:32+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"I set a fairly optimistic goal of reading 100 books in 2019, or ~8 per month. The good news I made it through January. Even better, I got them all from the @SFPublicLibrary. Success! 

Here's what I read, plus type, a brief comment, and whether I'd recommend it or not:"
2600,2019-01-31 17:55:55+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"5/ The FCA is asking for comments on the consultation paper by April 5, 2019, so feel free to write in with your opinion. 

Thanks to @msantoriESQ and @blockchain for bringing this to my attention."
2601,2019-01-31 17:55:55+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"4/ This is important. It's worth noting that this says nothing about what is legal or not in the US, but sets important precedent for the global view since the UK is more similar to the rest of the world in its treatment of securities (the US is more of the outlier)."
2602,2019-01-31 17:55:55+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"3/ 

b) utility tokens won't be captured in the regulatory regime unless they meet the definition of ""e-money""

c) ICOs issuing utility tokens and not security tokens will not require further regulation"
2603,2019-01-31 17:55:55+00:00,AriannaSimpson,"2/ The TL;DR is that: 

a) utility tokens are a thing (distinct from security tokens), and are defined as those that provide consumers with access to a current or prospective service or product and sometimes grant rights similar to pre-payment vouchers"
