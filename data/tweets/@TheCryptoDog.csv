44,2023-02-20 13:17:57+00:00,TheCryptoDog,"@BitcoinBlessed Yes, similar. Biggest difference is BetterFocus leans more heavily on dynamine and theacrine.

188,2023-02-06 16:10:15+00:00,TheCryptoDog,@SteveFig22 I am ultimately anticipating $200+ and will TP if I think overvalued. May try to hedge w/o selling some % if we get some crazy price spikes w/ accompanying GMX volumes.

If I want to sell, I lose a year's worth multiplier points - which are actually meaningful.

With upcoming upgrades to GMX and continuing trend of flow into DEX, it's easy to imagine 4-5x volumes in the future."

These rounds of investors are primarily crypto funds that have never invested in games before, like myself. I'll share feedback and ideas to games I'm investing in, but I don't tell them what to do."
3317,2022-09-16 14:17:50+00:00,TheCryptoDog,"@Hasbullish69 I mean I just like playing fun games. I just played the original Uncharted game last week it was great. I played super smash bros melee for years it definitely wasn't bleeding edge.

All I care about is that the game is fun..not bleeding edge. Everything else comes secondary."
3318,2022-09-16 14:15:37+00:00,TheCryptoDog,"@PhattyTrapz I'll be honest man you're still not carrying your point very clear.

The devs are the experienced ones creating the games. Most investors are not, they're cutting checks and supporting through marketing, etc. That said I have seen some game studio funds led by developers active."

""Based on what"" refers to?
Devs have been heavily funded by investors
I didn't say anything about NFT or defi space, I'm talking about the real world of gaming. You're thinking games for crypto people or sth."
3323,2022-09-16 14:03:23+00:00,TheCryptoDog,@Hasbullish69 Unreal Engine 5 is already out what are you talking about. I'm talking about actual games. Not a game on a Blockchain. And no it's not that complicated to incorporate tokens into your platform.

3325,2022-09-16 13:54:08+00:00,TheCryptoDog,"2023 will debut a number of fully fledged web3 enabled games created by well funded veteran game developers.

Games that cater to masses and are actually fun - not yield farming with visuals - are around the corner.

Next year gaming may usher the same excitement saw with NFTs."

4158,2022-08-18 13:50:23+00:00,TheCryptoDog,@pourteaux Have you ever taken testosterone before? From my personal experience it definitely made me feel more like a man.

4169,2022-08-18 13:10:20+00:00,TheCryptoDog,@tztokchad @crypt0wl2 I think I gotta agree to disagree. It comes down to what your interests are and if you are taking classes you aren't interested in then it will all feel pretty pointless.

5010,2022-08-06 14:02:40+00:00,TheCryptoDog,@MuhShroomy Half of what you said is factually incorrect. A neurotransmitter can be a neuromodulator. Cannabinoids act primarily through actions mediated by CB receptors.
5011,2022-08-06 13:59:57+00:00,TheCryptoDog,"@MuhShroomy I'm not exactly sure what you're saying.

CNS neuromodulators incl dopamine, serotonin, acth, histamine, norepinephrine, NO, and cannabinoids. 

CB agonists do upregulate 5ht2a. Cannabinoids mediate serotonergic signaling. I don't believe they act as direct serotonergic agonists."

But I had intense anxiety and insomnia and heat dysregulation for weeks. When I could sleep I would wake up after 30mins/hour freezing covered in sweat.
5126,2022-08-05 17:30:08+00:00,TheCryptoDog,"Another thing to note:

Cannabis is considerably more addicting than the (Western) general public currently understands.

Withdrawals can be extremely intense for those who've been consuming for years. For me it was a very painful, long process quitting, withdrawals lasted weeks."

5130,2022-08-05 17:20:28+00:00,TheCryptoDog,"@yugeyankeefan Point being though, a lot of smart kids will do well while consuming cannabis daily and think that it's no big deal, because they're still getting good grades, still seeing success, etc.

It was certainly an excuse for me. Why quit when I'm managing to do just fine?"
5131,2022-08-05 17:18:48+00:00,TheCryptoDog,@Kyle32775753 It's actually pretty tough quitting. It's more addicting than general public has been led to believe.

5133,2022-08-05 17:11:41+00:00,TheCryptoDog,"I'm not anti cannabis or anti drugs. I still have weed, but not every day. Not every week. 

I give my brain and body time for my cannabinoid receptors to reestablish their natural homeostasis.

It works great, I still get to get high, but I don't feel the drag from overexposure."
5134,2022-08-05 17:10:08+00:00,TheCryptoDog,"I had weed every night for over half a decade, through extremely competitive schooling all the way til 2022.

I still did alright, I was still top of my class, did well in crypto. It didn't destroy my life.

But it made my life worse in many small ways that added up over time."
5135,2022-08-05 17:06:59+00:00,TheCryptoDog,"Pro tip: if you smoke/vape weed every day your cannabinoid receptors will downregulate, you will be less happy, less motivated, less successful.

Easy to keep going bc, ""it's not that bad,"" or excuse, ""it helps my anxiety,sleep.""

It rekts sleep architecture, exacerbates anxiety."

7127,2022-04-24 11:57:22+00:00,TheCryptoDog,"@Rager I have never heard of that fatigue, I don't think that occurs ceasing creatine supplementation, not sure what mechanism would cause that. You simply return to baseline.

You get about 1g/day in your typical diet as is so you're just getting less creatine than when supplemented."
7128,2022-04-24 11:45:28+00:00,TheCryptoDog,@Rager Well that's how eating works. Same could be said for all dietary considerations... if you enjoy the benefits of eating healthy you have to keep eating healthy.

Genetics determines both sensitivity to androgens as well as amount of androgens produced.

Men produce 10-20x more testosterone than women, therefore men experience 10-20x more hairloss due to androgen exposure.

12106,2021-12-06 19:50:47+00:00,TheCryptoDog,I encourage everyone to do their own research because being aware of these kinds of things puts you ahead of those that don‚Äôt continue to learn.
12107,2021-12-06 19:50:27+00:00,TheCryptoDog,"zk-SNARKs have been used for a while, but I think the crypto economy has now developed enough to find them lucrative for both retail &amp; corporate actors (more on that another day).

Once crypto achieves a scalable privacy layer, a waterfall of cash will pour into the sector."
12108,2021-12-06 19:50:13+00:00,TheCryptoDog,"‚ÄúARK‚Äù stands for ‚Äúargument of knowledge.‚Äù

This simply refers back to the proofs involved being computationally sound.

The ‚Äúprover‚Äù (sender) is using a legitimate, trustworthy form of proof."
12109,2021-12-06 19:49:57+00:00,TheCryptoDog,"The ‚ÄúN‚Äù stands for ‚Äúnon-interactive.‚Äù

This just means the proof is a single message going from the prover to the verifier with no subsequent interaction being necessary.

This benefits the speed of the network."
12110,2021-12-06 19:49:44+00:00,TheCryptoDog,"Fees will make or break a protocol.

Because you don‚Äôt need to send/process a lot of information to transact, they need much less gas than similar privacy protocols.

Cheap, fast, private, the crypto trifecta."
12111,2021-12-06 19:49:28+00:00,TheCryptoDog,"The ‚ÄúS‚Äù in zk-SNARKs stands for ‚Äúsuccinct.‚Äù

All this means is that the protocol doesn‚Äôt need to send a lot of information to prove a transaction.

This drastically improves tx time and reduces gas."
12112,2021-12-06 19:49:16+00:00,TheCryptoDog,"zk = ""Zero Knowledge""

zk-SNARKs allow the sender &amp; receiver to generate ""proofs"" that hide info (balances, sent amts, etc.) in the tx.

So ""zero knowledge"" is needed to verify the tx.

The tx is still publicly verifiable as sound, but sensitive info about the tx is private."
12113,2021-12-06 19:49:01+00:00,TheCryptoDog,"Protocols that use zk-SNARKS let you send and receive cryptocurrencies anonymously at a faster and cheaper rate than other privacy methods.

I'll break down and simplify each aspect."
12114,2021-12-06 19:48:35+00:00,TheCryptoDog,"Different coins/protocols use a range of different types of cryptography; they each have their own advantages and trade-offs.

Of the many ways private crypto transactions are handled, zk-SNARKs seem the most likely to reach mass adoption (imo).

Here‚Äôs why:"
12115,2021-12-06 19:48:03+00:00,TheCryptoDog,"Cryptography is part of what replaces the ‚Äútrusted third-party‚Äù (like banks/gov) so we can send, mine, &amp; generally use cryptocurrency P2P.

To ‚Äúprove‚Äù ownership of assets, your secret private üîë is used in these complex mathematical puzzles.

These puzzles are called ‚Äúproofs.‚Äù"
12116,2021-12-06 19:46:27+00:00,TheCryptoDog,"(Experts, please bear with me as I oversimplify things.)

‚ÄúCryptocurrency‚Äù is based on ‚Äúcryptography.‚Äù

Cryptography = complex mathematical puzzles your computer solves to securely send &amp; receive information."
12117,2021-12-06 19:46:05+00:00,TheCryptoDog,"It stands for ‚ÄúZero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge‚Äù

Don‚Äôt worry, you don‚Äôt need to know what any of those words mean.

12196,2021-12-03 15:59:30+00:00,TheCryptoDog,"Chainlink set the standard &amp; became integral to the DeFi ecosystem. There's still work to be done, though.

My team is investing in https://t.co/aMkD1mdat1 to give DeFi a more solid foundation to stand on.

They're right about to launch, can't wait to see them start hitting DEXs."
12197,2021-12-03 15:58:50+00:00,TheCryptoDog,"Being an oracle aggregator, projects can integrate with @fluxprotocol to receive organic data and access any other oracle on that base layer.

It's sort of like a 1inch for data aggregation."
12198,2021-12-03 15:58:31+00:00,TheCryptoDog,"It's very clever.

Validators stake $FLX to provide data to the oracle.

If they provide incorrect data they, and their $, are slashed by other honest validators in the network.

This quickly snuffs out bad data feeds &amp; keeps bad actors from attempting to manipulate data."
12199,2021-12-03 15:58:04+00:00,TheCryptoDog,".@fluxprotocol is a cross-chain oracle my team is helping fund and support.

They attempt to solve the problem of bad oracle data by aggregating price feeds across many oracles and holding validators financially accountable if they provide wrong data."
12200,2021-12-03 15:57:32+00:00,TheCryptoDog,"A DEX using just a single oracle to save $ exposes traders to serious price manipulation risk, and every oracle requires the execution of multiple smart contracts to pull and provide data.

This costs a lot of gas. ‚õΩÔ∏èüí∏

Some are working on these issues, though:"
12201,2021-12-03 15:56:58+00:00,TheCryptoDog,"The DEX must almost constantly ""ask"" @chainlink, and possibly other oracles too, for the latest price data in order to provide traders with the most up-to-date prices.

Each time Chainlink gets price data, and each time the DEX gets price data from Chainlink, gas fees occur."
12202,2021-12-03 15:56:21+00:00,TheCryptoDog,"You're on a DEX and set the pair you'd like to trade.

To provide you with a price for each of those assets, the DEX ""asks"" Chainlink what the current prices are.

Chainlink automatically checks the prices of the most liquid CEXs, averages them, and informs the DEX."
12203,2021-12-03 15:55:45+00:00,TheCryptoDog,"The most popular blockchain oracle is @chainlink.

It launched in 2017 and has had a dedicated group of supporters ever since.

Chainlink is today's blue chip, standard, tried &amp; true decentralized oracle. I would guess that every DEX uses Chainlink data in some way."
12204,2021-12-03 15:55:17+00:00,TheCryptoDog,"Rather than delivering ""divine"" information, crypto oracles provide ""exact"" information.

For a DEX to provide an ""exact"" price for an asset you're trading, an oracle would probably combine price data from several sources then average them."
12205,2021-12-03 15:54:55+00:00,TheCryptoDog,"In mythology, oracles transmit information from one plane of reality to another.

In crypto, they do something similar.

A crypto oracle is an automated third-party that provides specific information from the outside world that smart contracts require to execute."
12206,2021-12-03 15:54:22+00:00,TheCryptoDog,"First, a background on the word itself.

In ancient Greek mythology, oracles were ""women chosen by the gods through which divine advice would be spoken through them.""

You ask the oracle something, and a god would speak through the oracle to deliver divine information. https://t.co/nlznQqbl9e"

12576,2021-11-17 17:37:13+00:00,TheCryptoDog,"There are Junior and Senior tranches.

Junior tranches are baskets of higher-risk higher-yield assets, and Senior tranches are low to medium-risk with low to medium yields.

The ""waterfall"" concept comes into play with how yield is distributed."
12577,2021-11-17 17:37:00+00:00,TheCryptoDog,"A frontrunner I'm betting on is @Waterfalldefi.

Their tranching system works like a ""waterfall.""

It's not as complicated as it might sound at first:"
12578,2021-11-17 17:36:40+00:00,TheCryptoDog,"In crypto, we can turn a tranching system like this on its head.

Imagine if you could have tranches of tranches.

You could get a ""slice"" of a diverse range of high-risk high-yield and a slice of low-risk low-yield assets in one place.

Sort of like tranching¬≤"
12579,2021-11-17 17:36:20+00:00,TheCryptoDog,"Tranches are useful for reducing risk and stabilizing returns.

Say you invest in a tranche with assets that yield a 3%, 5%, and 10% return, equally weighted.

If the higher-risk 10% yield asset depreciates in value by half, you still end up with a yield of about 4%."
12580,2021-11-17 17:35:59+00:00,TheCryptoDog,"If you're from tradfi, you're familiar with tranches.

If you're a crypto native, you're less likely to have as much experience with them.

""Tranche"" is French for ""slice,"" and it refers to a method of portioning things like securities into baskets to reduce risk for investors."

Typically VCs are under long lockup (2-4yrs+) and can't sell large % of the supply unless they did their time and put in the effort to make the project a success.

That doesn't go for all VCs, all projects, but that's largely where the industry is headed."

The mainnet launch is just the start."
13018,2021-11-02 17:33:29+00:00,TheCryptoDog,"A few more reasons:

- Synthetic/derivative DEXs will be booming as crypto develops, I want to invest long-term in DeFi, specifically options
- L2 is maturing, most will prefer DEXs &gt; CEXs
- Anon dev team that understands crypto's ethos"
13019,2021-11-02 17:33:13+00:00,TheCryptoDog,"@PremiaFinance:

- is a decentralized DeFi option platform, meaning no custody, etc.
- uses a fairer &amp; more efficient modified Black Scholes pricing algo
- is integrating with @chainlink for even more accuracy"
13020,2021-11-02 17:32:11+00:00,TheCryptoDog,"TL;DR:
Options are for hedging.

I made a long-term investment in a particular options AMM.

They're called @PremiaFinance, and my fund invested in the original public sale. Later, we doubled down to support them.

Here's more on them and why."
13021,2021-11-02 17:31:51+00:00,TheCryptoDog,"The reverse is a ""put"" option. You're paying for the right to sell an asset at a predetermined price until the option expires.

This is kind of like insurance.

You think an asset you hold might crash? Simply buy a put option and you can hedge against that risk."
13022,2021-11-02 17:31:32+00:00,TheCryptoDog,"Useful jargon:

When you would like to buy an asset in the future, but want to lock in today's price, that's called a ""call"" option.

It's like putting the asset on layaway. You're making a contractual agreement to have the option to buy that asset at a certain price/time."
13023,2021-11-02 17:31:16+00:00,TheCryptoDog,"Here's a situation where you'd use options:

Let's say you suspect a massive move but aren't sure if it will be up or down.

You could buy both a bullish option and a bearish option and only execute the option that's profitable.

The risk ofc is that there may be no big move."
13024,2021-11-02 17:31:00+00:00,TheCryptoDog,"So, instead of buying or selling an asset directly, options allow you to reserve the right to buy or sell a specific asset at a certain price within a certain time frame.

After the expiration date, you no longer have the right to buy/sell at the chosen price (strike price)."
13025,2021-11-02 17:30:41+00:00,TheCryptoDog,"Options are a powerful tool for hedging - or risk managing - your positions.

You pay a premium upfront which gives you the right to buy or sell an asset at a specified price (strike price) within a time frame (expiration date)."
13026,2021-11-02 17:30:24+00:00,TheCryptoDog,"A lot of you have probably never traded options.

If you have no idea what they are, or just have a vague understanding of the concept, I'll explain the basics on what they are and why they're useful:"
