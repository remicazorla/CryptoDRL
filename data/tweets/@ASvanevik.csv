The internet is the key difference.

20-30 years ago I would have agreed with you."
8,2023-02-24 06:08:40+00:00,ASvanevik,"Spotify has paid out $30B+ in royalties to music rights holders.

Imagine if they also had a platform for tokenizing and trading those music rights üëÄ

There's no-one better positioned to do this."

Let's see if @Spotify builds this future or if someone else does."

The main hurdles are:
1) securities regulations

And just like crypto ""has made anyone a VC"", we'll all be able to invest in artists early.

So we as fans will partially replace record labels!"
13,2023-02-24 05:48:42+00:00,ASvanevik,"4. ""Music funds"" will emerge that own portfolios of (fractions of) music pieces.

14,2023-02-24 05:48:41+00:00,ASvanevik,"3. Artists can sell a % of the royalty rights to a piece of music up front to fund the production.

Not too different from how record labels fund artists and get a (big) %.

Initial Music Offerings (IMO) (or something better named) will partially replace record labels."
15,2023-02-24 05:48:41+00:00,ASvanevik,"2. The NFT can be fractionalized into tokens such that people can own a share of the piece of music.

Shareholders get a proportional % of the royalties.

Royalties come from streaming primarily, making it a digitally native revenue source."
16,2023-02-24 05:48:41+00:00,ASvanevik,1. A piece of music will be represented by an NFT which gives the owner rights to royalties from streaming.

10,000 is also high for total ICOs in that era. Remember I built a database of ~7,000 ICOs.

So 0.2-0.3% might be roughly right."

That is, 30 projects in 10,000.

By ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù I mean:
1. product is used by a meaningful amount of users, AND
2. token is up

Does this sound right?"

6218,2022-01-16 06:31:01+00:00,ASvanevik,"So how do we make this happen?

Firstly, the DAO needs to approve the overall plan - incl a 20 ETH expense to make the initial wash trade on @LooksRareNFT.

Second, someone with 1,000 ETH needs to make the trade (alternatively, we split it up)."
6219,2022-01-16 06:31:00+00:00,ASvanevik,Here's a rough idea of the potential benefits from trading on @LooksRareNFT https://t.co/6PVK3Igohv
6220,2022-01-16 06:30:59+00:00,ASvanevik,"Since @Pudgy_Penguins is *not* royalty free, you'd be better off wrapping your pengu and trading it on @LooksRareNFT with such a scheme."
6221,2022-01-16 06:30:59+00:00,ASvanevik,"The DAO could reimburse all royalty fees to pengu traders on @LooksRareNFT.

This would effectively make @WrappedPenguins a ""royalty free"" collection.

In other words perfect for wash trading on LooksRare."
6222,2022-01-16 06:30:58+00:00,ASvanevik,BUT the @WrappedPenguins DAO controls the 3% royalties. Which is an opportunity! https://t.co/jiZ63emgnJ
6223,2022-01-16 06:30:55+00:00,ASvanevik,"Why buy a Wrapped pengu when you can buy a Pudgy one *and* earn $LOOKS?

The fees paid in ETH are the same in both cases:
Wrapped: 3% royalties + 2% platform
Pudgy: 3% royalties + 2% platform
= 5%

So there's currently no reason to buy a wrapped pengu."
6224,2022-01-16 06:30:55+00:00,ASvanevik,This is a disadvantage vs @Pudgy_Penguins where traders do earn rewards https://t.co/q0yssfI1Ga

6991,2021-12-01 06:47:00+00:00,ASvanevik,@kusama_no_neko My point is the network effect accrues to the broader EVM ecosystem - not Ethereum.
6992,2021-12-01 06:42:58+00:00,ASvanevik,@nootrality Interesting perspective. I don't think that's a premise of decentralization though? Many things are decentralized and have strong network effects creating a moat.

I don't see how ETH main chain benefits from this?"
6994,2021-12-01 06:39:35+00:00,ASvanevik,"Also, I wonder if ""EVM portability"" to some extent invalidates the fat protocol thesis. Instead you accrue value higher up in the stack: to wallets, interfaces, analytics, etc."
6995,2021-12-01 06:36:41+00:00,ASvanevik,"Isn't the growth of EVM (ironically) a self-destructing attack on Ethereum's developer moat?

When EVM = ETH, it was clear that dapp/infra devs would stick with ETH.

These days they can ship on tons of chains, and it's not clear how ETH benefits.

What am I missing?"

My understanding is that MetaMask has rolled out to:
- a small % on Chrome
- a bigger % on iOS
- an even bigger % on Android

So there's still a massive upside coming on this metric. https://t.co/cDysG33BXA"

But obv still owners:
- holding on exchanges, or
- spreading ETH across wallets

If upper bound is 4x what I said above, then top 10 owns &gt;10% of all ETH. Maybe that range?"

12731,2021-01-15 13:24:34+00:00,ASvanevik,"@scott_lew_is I'm saying there are several outcomes of that exercise which does not involve doxing an individual.

Example responses I could have gotten:
- It's another 3AC wallet
- It's corporate entity X that works with 3AC
- I know who it is but I'm not going to dox them"

12733,2021-01-15 11:24:40+00:00,ASvanevik,"@scott_lew_is Yep, perhaps investigations that could theoretically lead to inadvertent doxing of individuals should take place behind closed doors."
12734,2021-01-15 11:10:44+00:00,ASvanevik,"@scott_lew_is @AFDudley0 It's a great question.

Ideally you'd be made aware that you *can* be doxed. Because it possibly means you've *already* been doxed by someone else.

It's less ideal that some adversarial entity has already doxed you, and you're not even aware."
12735,2021-01-15 11:05:58+00:00,ASvanevik,@scott_lew_is But if your point is that someone analyzing a public blockchain is responsible for the privacy of those they come across in their investigations - that seems absurd.

15191,2020-09-01 07:49:06+00:00,ASvanevik,@dafacto Agree. IL is quite a subtle concept.
15192,2020-09-01 07:31:03+00:00,ASvanevik,"@dafacto In the scenario where SUSHI price moves a lot you‚Äôd be better off just hodling.

When SUSHI price stays ~constant vs ETH you‚Äôre better off farming.

Simplified but that‚Äôs the gist of it."
15193,2020-09-01 07:26:23+00:00,ASvanevik,@dafacto Almost - but you also (crucially) hold the SUSHI.
15194,2020-09-01 07:22:20+00:00,ASvanevik,@dafacto This involves a 3rd asset so it‚Äôs more complex. Not sure I understand ¬´sell profit strategy¬ª?
15195,2020-09-01 07:20:22+00:00,ASvanevik,@dafacto This assumes the LP fees don‚Äôt cover the difference (theoretically they could!). But would require quite a bit of trading fees before moving up.
15196,2020-09-01 07:19:00+00:00,ASvanevik,"@dafacto Let‚Äôs say you have 1000 sushi at $5. At $7.50 it will be worth $7500, so $2500 unrealized profit.

As an LP you‚Äôd have fewer than 1000 SUSHI tokens but more ETH. However the ETH will have been bought with SUSHI at a worse price.

So the LP‚Äôs stash will be worth less than $7.5k"
15197,2020-09-01 07:15:20+00:00,ASvanevik,"@dafacto Right but you slowly sell it for ETH on the way up, at all the price points.

While just holding SUSHI means not selling any before you‚Äôre at the top.

In other words you can sell all your stash at the highest price."
15198,2020-09-01 07:10:52+00:00,ASvanevik,@scupytrooples Such an underappreciated feature of web3 ‚ù§Ô∏è
15199,2020-09-01 07:08:36+00:00,ASvanevik,@dafacto Profit is in the price appreciation of SUSHI tokens. So it‚Äôs still unrealized profits in the above example.

15202,2020-09-01 06:52:23+00:00,ASvanevik,@dafacto Looks like #2 there made $60k on the move above. Subtract the gains they would have had as LP and maybe it‚Äôs $30k net profit or so.

16105,2020-07-20 18:56:08+00:00,ASvanevik,"Newcomers,

It's VERY important that you do not put any more money than you can afford to lose into smart contracts.

In a sense, DeFi is even riskier than ICOs because it often involves locking up a lot of money.

That money *could* all be lost in seconds.

Stay safe!"

20199,2019-10-18 04:00:15+00:00,ASvanevik,"This also answers *why* anyone would lock up Dai to get HKDai. Having and using HKDai means you are supporting the people of Hong Kong.

At the same time, you can of course use HKDai fully anonymously (or at least pseudonymously)."
20200,2019-10-18 04:00:14+00:00,ASvanevik,"Eventually the plan is to include interest-generation on the locked-up Dai (via @Compound), which will be donated to a charitable cause supporting the people of Hong Kong.

Would love to hear good suggestions on good HK organizations - ideally some umbrella org. (Maybe a DAO...)"
20201,2019-10-18 04:00:14+00:00,ASvanevik,"The contract is live on Ropsten, and the screenshot above shows the current basic UI. There are still some things that need to be ironed out before mainnet.

(in particular if you know how to avoid rounding issues when converting between units in Solidity, please DM me!)"
20202,2019-10-18 04:00:14+00:00,ASvanevik,"What's the current status and future of HKDai?

HKDai is currently in its very first iteration, which means it only supports the bare minimum: deposits/withdraws + basic ERC20 token functionality."
20203,2019-10-18 04:00:14+00:00,ASvanevik,"When implemented correctly, this means the HKDai-Dai peg is unbreakable."
20204,2019-10-18 04:00:13+00:00,ASvanevik,Withdraw is the opposite operation: it lets you withdraw Dai from the smart contract. You must return 7.8 HKDai for every 1 Dai you want to withdraw. The HKDai you return are taken out of circulation.
20205,2019-10-18 04:00:13+00:00,ASvanevik,Deposit lets you deposit Dai into the smart contract. You receive exactly 7.8 HKDai for every 1 Dai you deposit. These 7.8 HKDai are minted at the time of your deposit.
20206,2019-10-18 04:00:13+00:00,ASvanevik,"How does HKDai work?

HKDai in its current form is based on a simple smart contract. The main two features of the contract (in addition to standard ERC20 functions) are: deposit and withdraw."
20207,2019-10-18 04:00:12+00:00,ASvanevik,"Specifically, HKDai:
- requires no bank account - only an Ethereum wallet
- can be sent to anyone, anywhere in the world, within seconds
- has a stable value, as it is pegged to Dai at a constant rate of exactly 7.8 : 1
- cannot be blocked or intercepted by any intermediaries"
20208,2019-10-18 04:00:12+00:00,ASvanevik,"But let's take a step back - why HKDai?

HKDai gives the people of Hong Kong a familiar currency in a digital form, with the benefits of the Ethereum ecosystem."
20209,2019-10-18 04:00:12+00:00,ASvanevik,This means that you can always redeem your HKDai for Dai at a rate of exactly 7.8 HKDai per 1 Dai. This is guaranteed via an open-source smart contract issued on the Ethereum blockchain.
20210,2019-10-18 04:00:11+00:00,ASvanevik,"While the HKD is pegged by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) intervening in markets at certain price points (sell HKD at HK$7.75; buy HKD at HK$7.85), HKDai is 100% collateralized by Dai.

As you probably know, Dai is pegged to the USD."
20211,2019-10-18 04:00:11+00:00,ASvanevik,"What is HKDai?

HKDai is a cryptocurrency which - similarly to the Hong Kong Dollar (HKD) - is soft-pegged to the US Dollar (USD) at a rate of 7.8 HKDai to 1 USD."
