8934,2019-01-04 12:13:29+00:00,PeterLBrandt,@riteshpoddar @MoonOverlord Parabolas are quite rare. I have gone years without seeing one. They are numerous this year -- and that fact alone makes me a bit shy about them. I would 50% of them in the past produced an 80% decline.

8936,2019-01-04 03:17:36+00:00,PeterLBrandt,@PavanJakka Often times -- and this is just my judgement call -- the first parabola falls short of 50% and an even larger parabola forms.

8942,2019-01-03 22:46:45+00:00,PeterLBrandt,@BrynneKKelly Fundamentals have a way of changing when the bulls are least likely to expect or accept it.
8943,2019-01-03 14:24:55+00:00,PeterLBrandt,@riteshpoddar @MoonOverlord Market and chart opinion have nothing to do with protecting capital and determining asymmetrical trading situations. I am a Bayesian -- and opinions are always subject to revision.
8944,2019-01-03 13:03:21+00:00,PeterLBrandt,@ZeroVolatility @DakTrading All valid points. But your rudeness deserves a block
8945,2019-01-03 12:14:54+00:00,PeterLBrandt,"Impossible for $AAPL to decline below a certain level because of their cash stash? Most likely true, but throughout late 1970s/early 1980s entire $DJIA traded at less than book-value-per share. #Fundamentals_Change"
8946,2019-01-03 03:07:26+00:00,PeterLBrandt,@ZeroVolatility @DakTrading Are you aware that the entire DJIA &amp; S&amp;P and most component stocks traded below book value per share for an entire decade ending in 1983.
8947,2019-01-03 03:04:33+00:00,PeterLBrandt,"@MoonOverlord The original, in blue, was a parabola -- but failed to materialize. This is why parabola concepts must always be part of larger perspective."
8948,2019-01-03 00:48:31+00:00,PeterLBrandt,@PhilCrypto77 I completely agree. Just reporting what the chart implies.
8949,2019-01-02 23:46:49+00:00,PeterLBrandt,@thakopia I do not consider 1 or 4 hour charts to be valid quite frankly. Too subject to AI and HFTs
8950,2019-01-02 23:38:49+00:00,PeterLBrandt,@DakTrading Most global stocks trades for less than the book value per share throughout the 1970s. Nothing new here.
