Demand for certain services (like air travel) are still temporarily soaring amid continued record MoM inflation. Unemployment is still relatively high compared to the current inflation rate."
412,2022-07-13 13:18:43+00:00,masonnystrom,"As inflation hits multi-decade highs across CPI and Core inflation, its important to remember that the vast majority of people haven't lived through periods of high inflation in their adult lives.

How will the populous reaction to inflation be different compared to 40 years ago?"

656,2022-03-31 18:01:54+00:00,masonnystrom,@andrewkimARK 4. Rarity in TCGs is fine if the utility is the same (e.g. Holographic vs shiny vs plain but all are technically the same card and the rarity doesn't effect P2P competition.

Do you think Ronin as a sidechain generates any value for Ethereum? There are no transaction fees but is there value in ETH indirectly securing Ronin?"

The argument goes:

1) That discount is because they have lockups which makes them illiquid so they should get a deal on the round.

What makes an NFT valuable - the blockchain or the creator?

What are the limits of an NFTs value?

How does consumer behavior change over the next decade?

Digital assets can now be provably digitally owned. They don't have to be numbers in a centralized database but instead actual assets owned by users. There are nuances to the concept of ownership, but overall ownership is incredibly powerful"

On-chain ‚Äì data is stored in the token itself. You're good so long as you don't lose it.

Absolutely. Many will lose value, specifically collectibles and art. The NFT correction will be rough.

Plenty of collectibles are worthless or lose value over time. As with most goods and services the price or value is what someone is willing to pay. Over time the market decides the true value of NFTs just as it does with Bitcoin."

1) NFTs are just a standard that can be integrated into other protocols so that shouldn't be an issue but yes there is some risk. I don't think it's a large risk tbh because an artist could always port over a deprecated platform to another for an owner."

3410,2020-10-05 14:09:38+00:00,masonnystrom,"Now Chiliz can go to Milan or Manchester and say:

""We have $5 million in open interest on a fan token that we will issue for you. Do you want to partner with us?""

Chiliz is able to demonstrate clear demand to large sports organizations that might otherwise be slow to innovate."
3411,2020-10-05 14:09:37+00:00,masonnystrom,"This is a really smart move from Chiliz. 

TLDR: Basically, Chiliz is letting fans get on a waitlist by signaling the intent to purchase shares of what would be new Fan tokens. If Chiliz issues the token, stakers get first purchase rights and a nice 10% $CHZ bonus."

3980,2020-06-17 14:35:37+00:00,masonnystrom,.@GodsUnchained appears to have found product-market fit amongst the trading card gaming landscape. The company has almost an order of magnitude more owners and total trading volume compared to the next closest card game listed on OpenSea.
3981,2020-06-17 14:35:37+00:00,masonnystrom,".@CryptoKitties lead the way in total volume (62,000 ETH) and boast an impressive 86,000 owners. @Decentraland holds the highest average asset price at 5.47 ether.

‚Ä¢ Digital ownership - you own your assets, cards, items.

4033,2020-03-06 18:55:23+00:00,masonnystrom,Read the full piece about the Rise of Individual Securitization. https://t.co/K4Mc6tYOgQ
4034,2020-03-06 18:55:22+00:00,masonnystrom,The closest existing mechanism to investing in human potential is hiring someone or perhaps VC investing in entrepreneurs. I'm most interested to see how individual securitization can potentially further align incentives and spur greater value creation.
4035,2020-03-06 18:55:22+00:00,masonnystrom,"While a token in exchange for services is fairly simple, further rewards could potentially be integrated. New models of individual securitization will be fascinating to watch moving forward, especially once regulations regarding security token offerings are firmly established."
4036,2020-03-06 18:55:22+00:00,masonnystrom,"This past week Alex issued a secondary token (ALEX.2SF) backed by his original $ALEX to fund his life as an entrepreneur in SF in exchange for part of his future revenues/net worth. 
https://t.co/Co4BUv38KR"
4037,2020-03-06 18:55:22+00:00,masonnystrom,"$ALEX similarly offers a token in exchange for an hour of Alex‚Äôs time plus other potential benefits such as potential ""exposure"" to his future career. More recently Alex has even started a side project to issue a fashion line backed by his personal token. https://t.co/lRkN26m8P8"
4038,2020-03-06 18:55:21+00:00,masonnystrom,"Experiments with individual tokenization in exchange for time and experience also exist, including @AlexMasmej ($ALEX), @dApp_boi ($BOI), and @bramanathan($CNSL). Tokens like BOI and CNSL can be redeemed for professional services (web development) or advisory and consulting work."
4039,2020-03-06 18:55:21+00:00,masonnystrom,"Cryptonetworks enable anyone to securitize their individual knowledge, creativity, judgment, or future potential. Ethereum has already witnessed experiments with cash flow based securities such as the tokenization of Spencer Dinwiddie‚Äôs existing contract."
4040,2020-03-06 18:55:21+00:00,masonnystrom,"There are many types of ISA models including technical training, job placement, and mentorship all in exchange for a predetermined percent of an individual‚Äôs salary. @LambdaSchool, @JoinFreeAgency, and @SharpestMindsAI are just three companies that use these respective models."
4041,2020-03-06 18:55:21+00:00,masonnystrom,"For instance, ISA marketplace Edly estimates that $500 million in ISA‚Äôs will be originated by the end of 2020. That sounds like a lot, but for context, private student debt sits at about $120 billion while federal student loans are north of $1.5 trillion."
4042,2020-03-06 18:55:20+00:00,masonnystrom,This has manifested in the explosion of income share agreements (ISAs) which have grown incredibly popular as a mechanism to align human capital potential and value creation.
4043,2020-03-06 18:55:20+00:00,masonnystrom,"Human capital refers to our individual skills, education, knowledge, judgment, and creativity. A software engineer‚Äôs ability to write great code, Warren Buffet‚Äôs judgment, and Ronaldo‚Äôs striking ability are all examples of human capital."
4044,2020-03-06 18:55:20+00:00,masonnystrom,For those less familiar with the concept ‚Äì securitization is the process of turning something into a financial instrument/asset. One of the most recent trends in Ethereum is the securitization of human capital.

4084,2019-08-12 02:26:15+00:00,masonnystrom,Totally agree. This would go a long way to reducing the crazy APRs of many defi protocols.

4089,2019-07-17 17:46:14+00:00,masonnystrom,"OMG. Did a sitting congressman, Denver Riggleman, just reference that he looked at Libra's Github and present a technical knowledge unseen by any other member of Congress."
4090,2019-07-17 16:36:47+00:00,masonnystrom,"@nlw Agreed, they will need to be explicit in regards to governance. Like you said, we need more clarity."
4091,2019-07-17 16:30:49+00:00,masonnystrom,@nlw 100%. Hard to believe that Libra Association would block the purchase/takeover of any of their 100 founding members.
4092,2019-07-17 16:27:54+00:00,masonnystrom,Actually a super valid question.
4093,2019-07-17 15:06:55+00:00,masonnystrom,@nlw Soliloquy style testimony is also not very helpful...
4094,2019-07-17 14:53:29+00:00,masonnystrom,"@matthewde_silva Maloney brings up the valid point about embedded wallets. If Facebook, WhatsApp, etc only embed the Calibra wallet then there's no way other wallets will gain market share or be able to compete. Who will people trust more, an unvetted third party wallet or Facebook?"
4095,2019-07-17 14:41:03+00:00,masonnystrom,"@nlw Wow, @PatrickMcHenry coming in with the prepared questions. Can we yield the rest of the time to him?"
4096,2019-07-16 15:15:21+00:00,masonnystrom,"@msantoriESQ The best part is he followed that with ""I have a great respect for Facebook"" haha"
4097,2019-07-16 14:59:24+00:00,masonnystrom,"@matthewde_silva Yeah, so yes Facebook will incentivize Calibra wallet over other wallets."
4098,2019-07-10 23:38:00+00:00,masonnystrom,"Honestly, I'm more excited about the health/fitness/wellbeing tweetstorm that comes with the release of the app than I am about the actual app. Still excited for the app though!"
4099,2019-07-10 23:38:00+00:00,masonnystrom,"Reasons why this app will be awesome: 1)@Naval said he hasn't achieved his ""what keeps you fit"" hobby. This will be it. 2) He has 100 tweets about fitness that he hasn't released so you know he's thought about it and is developing an app he knows will work for him. 3) It's Naval."

4103,2019-07-09 02:30:36+00:00,masonnystrom,Is there a venture fund that specifically invests in entrepreneurs using ISAs (income share agreements) rather than only in their companies. Would entrepreneurs even be open to such an agreement?
