8729,2021-05-25 14:12:00+00:00,TuurDemeester,@adamkbaranowski Linux was seen as a joke by many in the early 90s

8731,2021-05-25 14:04:35+00:00,TuurDemeester,IMO Ethereum is Microsoft Windows and Bitcoin is Linux. The first is a commercial non-forward compatible software operating system. The second is the open platform on top of which all modern computing infrastructure is built.

12406,2020-09-04 19:21:13+00:00,TuurDemeester,14/ So basically my opinion on Bitcoin vs Ethereum has been unchanged for the past 4 years. I'm still open to being challenged though :-) https://t.co/teMg3nBxbE
12407,2020-09-04 19:21:13+00:00,TuurDemeester,"13/ And Bitcoin functionality scales slowly but surely, driven by input from world class engineers: 
- microtransations (Lightning Network)
- fast settlement &amp; asset issuance (Liquid)
- global access (Satellite)
- sophisticated smart contracts (Simplicity)
- pseudonimity (Wasabi)"
12408,2020-09-04 19:21:13+00:00,TuurDemeester,"12/ Bitcoin OTOH shares a lot of the seeming rigidity that Amazon had. The base layer is very restrictive but as a result also highly reliable, with an lifetime uptime so far of 99.98%. Client software is lightweight, a full node can be run on an off the shelf smart phone."
12409,2020-09-04 19:21:13+00:00,TuurDemeester,"11/  I suspect similarly, that Ethereum is not designed for mass market appeal. 

It's an unscalable experiment of a market place, not a methodical design of a market place, and therefore not a platform that can serve a mature market."
12410,2020-09-04 19:21:12+00:00,TuurDemeester,"9/ So why is it that I suspect Amazon-like growth for Bitcoin, versus Ebay-like slugglishness for Ethereum?  

Imo, over the long run, the user experience on the bitcoin platform will prove to be the most reliable, predictable, and enjoyable - which is what drives hyper-growth."
12411,2020-09-04 19:21:12+00:00,TuurDemeester,"8/ Indeed Bitcoin can scale, but it takes a long time to build and get acceptance for these new layers of functionality that plug back into its stodgy blockchain. Ethereum on the other hand can link into new platforms easily, and scaling hasn't been a big problem so far."
12412,2020-09-04 19:21:12+00:00,TuurDemeester,"7/ Bitcoin on the other hand is much more restrictive. The cost for publishing a byte of information on the blockchain has always been many times higher than on ETH, and there are many restrictions as to what code can be published."
12413,2020-09-04 19:21:11+00:00,TuurDemeester,"5/ Amazon was much more restrictive: Bezos only sold books, didn't allow for third party vendors during its first five years, and each book only had one page on the website. This significantly slowed down early growth, and made it less clear where the platform would go long term."
12414,2020-09-04 19:21:11+00:00,TuurDemeester,"4/ Ebay was a very open, flexible platform: any user can list anything for sale, choose the terms of the auction, and build their reputation on the platform. As a result, growth was fueled from many directions at once, and the company often dominated the dotcom space."
12415,2020-09-04 19:21:11+00:00,TuurDemeester,"3/ A lot can be said about differences in operational management, but I'd argue there is a fundamental conceptual difference between the two platforms which explains a lot of the long run difference in revenue."
12416,2020-09-04 19:21:10+00:00,TuurDemeester,"2/ Both Amazon and Ebay were founded in 1995, and raced neck-on-neck for a long time. E.g. in 2003, AMZN market cap was $20B, versus Ebay with $35B! 
And yet today, 17 years later, Ebay's market cap is still $35 billion, whereas Amazon boasts $1.6 trillion. Why?"
12417,2020-09-04 19:21:10+00:00,TuurDemeester,"1/ This thread suggests that Bitcoin is analogous to Amazon, while flexible blockchain platforms like Ethereum are analogous to Ebay. 

I argue that while Ethereum's approach allows for rapid early growth, Bitcoin will end up being the platform most valued by consumers.

14271,2020-04-21 00:27:18+00:00,TuurDemeester,12/ Now I'll try and apply this to the circumstances in which our dog Siffie died. To sum up some of the particulars:
14272,2020-04-21 00:27:18+00:00,TuurDemeester,"11/ The important takeaway for me here is that with my actions I can certainly influence probabilities, and that my work to be a responsible pet owner was never in vain, but I need to be humble in accepting that I ultimately do not control exact outcomes."
14273,2020-04-21 00:27:17+00:00,TuurDemeester,"9/ If I take a snapshot of my entire world on 1/1/2020 and assume the exact same inputs (same character, intentions, history, physical conditions, etc), then in a thought experiment I can imagine millions of parallel universes where the last 4 months are played out."
14274,2020-04-21 00:27:17+00:00,TuurDemeester,8/ When I do succeed in protecting my family (e.g. by always walking my dog on leash) I can can claim responsibility for that outcome. But I also need to recognize that I never controlled it 100%. E.g. my leashed dog can still be killed by a swerving car.
14275,2020-04-21 00:27:17+00:00,TuurDemeester,"7/ And so while I can use my skills, experience and willpower to protect the lives of my loved ones, I do have to accept that randomness/chance will play a not insignificant role in shaping the actual events that make up my life."
14276,2020-04-21 00:27:16+00:00,TuurDemeester,6/ I think there is a philosophically sensible reconciliation possible by embracing the fact that in our cosmos there are both random and intentional forces (e.g. human action) at work.
14277,2020-04-21 00:27:16+00:00,TuurDemeester,"5/ So how can I possibly reconcile these statements with each other:
- I am committed to protecting the health of my family
- Our beloved pet died suddenly
- In hindsight my actions regarding her health were imperfect
- I am not ""bad"", irresponsible, or morally reprehensible"
14278,2020-04-21 00:27:16+00:00,TuurDemeester,"4/ In the same vein, trying to convince myself that no conceivable action from my part during the course of Siffie's 34 month lifespan could have worked to prevent this fatal outcome would simultaneously undermine my entire belief in science and the malleability of health."
14279,2020-04-21 00:27:15+00:00,TuurDemeester,"3/ The religious/deterministic notion of ""it was meant to be this way, there's nothing you could have done"" I reject, as I experience that as fundamentally unempowering and untrue."
14280,2020-04-21 00:27:15+00:00,TuurDemeester,"2/ Apparently feelings of guilt are very common after experiencing the sudden death of a loved one. That piqued my interest, but in itself didn't offer real relief."
14281,2020-04-21 00:27:15+00:00,TuurDemeester,"1/23 I've been working through a surprising amount of guilt after our dog Siffie died last week: ""I should have recognized the severity of the symptoms, should have taken her to the clinic earlier, she may have survived had I acted more responsibly, ..."""

16338,2020-01-21 03:38:17+00:00,TuurDemeester,"4/ On his blog, Wood also argued that humans have ""primordial urges"", such as the urge to submit, master and control others... which ""make us human"" and require ""proper release"" lest they cause mental illness.

17349,2019-11-07 20:09:01+00:00,TuurDemeester,"20/ Finally there‚Äôs a parallel between how the Dutch accessed capital via annuities, and IEO tokens today which give bitcoin exchanges access to capital. Our report predicts bitcoin based mutual life insurance, which is the next evolutionary step after annuities."
17350,2019-11-07 20:09:00+00:00,TuurDemeester,"19/ The world‚Äôs first IPO was the East India Trading Company (VOC). Its shares were so liquid and desirable that they were widely used as collateral.

17351,2019-11-07 20:08:58+00:00,TuurDemeester,"18/ 16th-17th century maritime trade was risky but lucrative, which was the perfect breeding ground for the insurance sector. In the bitcoin economy we are seeing (proto-)insurance arrangements that resemble Dutch practices. https://t.co/uQRkAUJI8h"
17352,2019-11-07 20:08:54+00:00,TuurDemeester,"17/ The Dutch perfected deposit banking, with the world famous Amsterdam Wisselbank. We see echoes of heir staunch emphasis on security in bitcoin banking today, which is innovating with trust-minimized solutions such as collaborative custody. https://t.co/OIodPa3PwO"
17353,2019-11-07 20:08:51+00:00,TuurDemeester,16/ Over to the parallels between the financial economy of the Dutch Golden Age and that of Bitcoin today. https://t.co/P3AzPvRY9o

- Not Your Keys, not Your Bitcoin
- HODL"
17355,2019-11-07 20:08:45+00:00,TuurDemeester,"14/ Another parallel are the memes! The Protestants had slogans voicing their resolve to cut out the Church as a middle man: 
- Sola Fide (faith alone is enough, no need for a priest), and 
- Sola Scriptura (the bible is enough, you can now read it in your own language)."
17356,2019-11-07 20:08:44+00:00,TuurDemeester,"13/ And the final requirement for a reformation is for the rebels to have credible strategies of defense. The Dutch protestants mastered water as a defensive moat against invasions, the millennials have cryptography at their disposal. https://t.co/lk3INVNmUr"
17357,2019-11-07 20:08:41+00:00,TuurDemeester,"12/ Third, we need people who have something to fight for. In the 16th century that was the merchant class, today that is the millennial generation who don‚Äôt trust the financial system and who are heavily invested in technology. https://t.co/XWA2YHyrT4"

17359,2019-11-07 20:08:39+00:00,TuurDemeester,"10/ The most important 16th century innovations were in the area of maritime exploration, international business, and of course the printing press, which, in one century, lowered the price of a book from a full year‚Äôs wage to the equivalent of a chicken. https://t.co/qMgmlUZfCp"
17360,2019-11-07 20:08:37+00:00,TuurDemeester,"9/ The second requirement for a reformation is a technological revolution, which acts as a general accelerant in the battle of ideas: it lowers the cost of both information and travel."
17361,2019-11-07 20:08:36+00:00,TuurDemeester,8/ The service provided by the Church was access into heaven (for which it charged money by selling indulgences). The service provided by the financial system today is access to ‚Äúfinancial heaven‚Äù (for which it charges money in the form of inflation tax).
17362,2019-11-07 20:08:36+00:00,TuurDemeester,"7/ First, we need a painful status quo in the form of a rent-seeking monopolistic service provider. In the 16th century that was the Catholic Church, today that is the financial system of fiat money and central banking. https://t.co/TUgOFrjJC3"

17365,2019-11-07 20:08:29+00:00,TuurDemeester,"4/ Aside from the four general Reformation parallels, our report also suggests that there are significant similarities between the innovative economy of 17th century Netherlands and the bitcoin economy today. This may give us insight into what's coming for bitcoin."
17366,2019-11-07 20:08:29+00:00,TuurDemeester,"3/ The Protestant Reformation was a multi-generational conflict (16th-17th C.) that produced the separation of church and state, and which profoundly reshaped the economies of Europe and the New World. Today, bitcoin suggests that it‚Äôs possible to separate _money_ and state."

20945,2019-02-20 16:05:14+00:00,TuurDemeester,"15/ We are grateful for the valuable feedback on our drafts, by @dhruvbansal, @nic__carter, @jratcliff, @woonomic, David Martin, @eervin1 and several others. All errors remain our own."
20946,2019-02-20 16:05:14+00:00,TuurDemeester,"14/ Credit for these new concepts is due to @TamasBlummer, whom we are very blessed to work with. My co-founder @Michiel did a lot of work on clarifying language and producing the visuals."
20947,2019-02-20 16:05:13+00:00,TuurDemeester,"13/  In sum, we believe these new Bitcoin measures tell us about Mr. Market‚Äôs emotional state, about how whales are moving their pieces on the chessboard, and give us tools to meaningfully compare long-term investor activity."
20948,2019-02-20 16:05:13+00:00,TuurDemeester,"12/ (One could even make the case that measures such as Liveliness and HODLer Net Position Change help make Bitcoin a more compelling settlement platform, because they allow for auditing the commitment of value investors to the platform.)"
20949,2019-02-20 16:05:13+00:00,TuurDemeester,"11/ So HODLer Net Position Change approximates insider buying and selling. Afaik, because of the blockchain‚Äôs singular properties, this measure is unique in the investment world. Imagine being able to see how big, long held stashes of physical gold are moved around in the world."
20950,2019-02-20 16:05:12+00:00,TuurDemeester,10/ A derivative from Liveliness is HODLer Net Position Change. This metric gives insight into what moves Bitcoin whales are making: https://t.co/xqjVXx4ono
20951,2019-02-20 16:05:11+00:00,TuurDemeester,"9/ #Liveliness can be used to weight market cap when comparing cryptocurrencies, as it punishes coins with inflated market cap or with high amounts of artificial volumes. It can also be used as a foundational tool from which to derive other insightful time series."
20952,2019-02-20 16:05:10+00:00,TuurDemeester,"8/ Next, we move on to the concept of #Liveliness, which is a new quantitative measure that gives insights to shifts in saving behavior. The higher the amount of meaningful transaction settlement a blockchain accommodates (older coins moving), the higher its Liveliness. https://t.co/2QNoaZ2oXL"

Greed: high % of market cap consists of unrealized profits.

Optimism, hope, fear: the ratio drops as prices decline.

Capitulation: unrealized gains turn into losses. https://t.co/Km8lt5U56N"
20954,2019-02-20 16:05:07+00:00,TuurDemeester,"6/ We can express the Unrealized P&amp;L in a relative way also, as a percentage of the market cap that consists of profits or losses. This allows us to approximate investor sentiment. https://t.co/gYgWZC2SVu"
20955,2019-02-20 16:05:04+00:00,TuurDemeester,"4/ Let‚Äôs jump ahead to a core assumption in our research, which is probably also the most controversial one: A Bitcoin transaction is the strongest expression of optionality / private key control, and therefore is always a realization of value. https://t.co/adO52ub9JY"
20956,2019-02-20 16:05:02+00:00,TuurDemeester,"3/ A lot of the Bitcoin saver (aka ‚ÄòHODLer‚Äô) focused research lay quite dormant, until we saw a flurry of new concepts being developed in 2018. https://t.co/zuTFXl54WC"

20958,2019-02-20 16:04:58+00:00,TuurDemeester,"1/ Thought I'd share a few thoughts on our latest research. Today we suggest new tools to value Bitcoin and altcoins. One approximates sentiment (via profit/loss), another estimates HODLer buying &amp; selling.
