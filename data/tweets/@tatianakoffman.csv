1676,2021-05-30 18:23:05+00:00,tatianakoffman,"@JuiceboxCA Yes, if you are dating someone who naturally doesn’t want to contribute anything back. I remember when I didn’t have money and dated someone who did. I would go out of my way to treat them to lunch, desert, a drink, a home cooked meal. Splitting is for friends."
1677,2021-05-30 18:14:03+00:00,tatianakoffman,@JuiceboxCA I offer because I don’t want to be perceived as being there for a free meal or taking advantage. I offer because I can afford to pay and want to make that clear. I expect them to decline if they want to continue seeing me. And I make it “even” by making contributions of my own.
1678,2021-05-30 18:12:16+00:00,tatianakoffman,@JuiceboxCA If you agree then why start the thread? Assuming you don’t have issues with money... why are inquiring when is it okay to start splitting dinner bills? Wouldn’t you want to treat the person you are romantically involved with? Same as they would for you?
1679,2021-05-30 18:10:11+00:00,tatianakoffman,"@JuiceboxCA Respecting and engaging in further romantic communication are two different things. If we are splitting bills, we are friends not dating."
1680,2021-05-30 18:04:36+00:00,tatianakoffman,"@JuiceboxCA And yes I always offer to pay, because it is the polite thing to do. But their acceptance indicates that we have different relationships with money and it would create friction in the future. I smile and take it as a data point."
1681,2021-05-30 18:03:27+00:00,tatianakoffman,"@JuiceboxCA It’s about doing something nice for the person you are with and not dissecting  the bill after. If I invited someone to a concert, I would just get the tickets for both. If I invited someone to my house for dinner, I would buy all the food and cook it. Splitting kills the gesture"
1682,2021-05-30 17:49:13+00:00,tatianakoffman,"@JuiceboxCA And if they have money they should want to spend it on the person they like. I am completely self sufficient and spend money on people in my life without hesitation. First date dinner is on the guy or the romance is dead. When I want to pay, I will invite or gift."
1683,2021-05-30 17:45:59+00:00,tatianakoffman,"@JuiceboxCA Unpopular opinion - I always offer on the first date, but honestly I expect them to pay and if they allow me to pay for half, I will, but there is not second date. I don’t want to date someone that is stressed over money... contd"

2485,2020-10-06 21:02:18+00:00,tatianakoffman,@Hanakookie1 I think we are on the same side. This was an explanatory note.
2486,2020-10-06 20:51:35+00:00,tatianakoffman,"9/ Finally, if you’re wondering why housing and stock prices are going up, it’s because cheap money has no place to go. Cash savings will get eroded and bonds don’t pay enough. Real people may lose jobs and homes, but investors gain opportunities."
2487,2020-10-06 20:48:39+00:00,tatianakoffman,"8/ Additionally, there is a question of velocity. At a time of uncertainty, people save more and spend less. More stimulus means more savings and not necessarily more spending. After vaccine is announced, velocity of money will increase drastically, forcing inflation up."
2488,2020-10-06 20:46:43+00:00,tatianakoffman,"7/ The risk with the Fed’s approach is overshooting inflation targets. If inflation increases too fast, the stability of the USD as a unit of exchange is at risk. In theory, the Fed can pull back on stimulus by raising interest rates. In practice, this may not be done in time."
2489,2020-10-06 20:45:46+00:00,tatianakoffman,"6/ Inflation is correlated to full employment. As more people become employed, and good candidates are harder to find, salaries begin to rise, and more money spent is on consumer goods, driving prices further up."
2490,2020-10-06 20:44:35+00:00,tatianakoffman,"5/ There is an inverse relationship between inflation and interest rates. If rates are too high, you will keep cash in high interest savings or bonds. If rates are too low, you are likely to spend or invest your cash, borrow for a house, or take a loan for a business expansion."
2491,2020-10-06 20:43:42+00:00,tatianakoffman,"4/ Inflation is viewed as a necessary side-effect to promote spending. If keeping your money in cash erodes it away, you are likely to invest it into a business, stocks, land or commodities. Investment creates jobs."
2492,2020-10-06 20:43:07+00:00,tatianakoffman,"3/ The Fed has a dual mandate to achieve (1) stable prices and (2) maximum sustainable employment.

The Fed has two main tools to achieve this -  (1) quantitive easing or capital infusion,  and (2) lowering interest rates."
2493,2020-10-06 20:42:47+00:00,tatianakoffman,3/ U.S. suffers from chronic DEFLATION. This is because there is a constant shortage of dollars worldwide. Up to 80% of global business and debt is denominated in dollars. Global dependence on dollars is driving demand for alternative currencies - Digital Yuan and Digital Euro.
2494,2020-10-06 20:42:09+00:00,tatianakoffman,"2/ Inflation between 2-3% is considered healthy. Inflation in the double digits, is called hyperinflation. 

We have seen this recently in Venezuela, Zimbabwe and Lebanon, where governments print too much money too fast, deeming that currency worthless."
2495,2020-10-06 20:41:39+00:00,tatianakoffman,"1/ What is Inflation?

Inflation mean that prices of the same goods increase over time, making the purchasing power of each dollar LESS. 

That means the same car, house or loaf of bread now costs more."

3144,2020-09-01 19:33:08+00:00,tatianakoffman,"5/ The #DeFi space is still incredibly risky and speculative. Be careful and do your own research. 

For the full article, read here: https://t.co/MK3eiT6qft"
3145,2020-09-01 19:32:54+00:00,tatianakoffman,"4.5/ Synthetic Asset Bridges - #Bitcoin is great as a store of value, but difficult to use as collateral. Creating a digital representation of Bitcoin allows it to be used in financial contracts. Bitcoin is currently being tokenized faster than it is being mined."
3146,2020-09-01 19:31:31+00:00,tatianakoffman,"4.4/ Decentralized Prediction Markets, Options and Insurance - This next category is all about betting on something happening or not happening in the future, and includes decentralized prediction markets, on-chain options and insurance, in a fully automated matter."
3147,2020-09-01 19:31:22+00:00,tatianakoffman,"4.3/ Asset Management Protocols - A recent category of #DeFi products creates frameworks for users to pool funds for investments akin to robo-advisors, automated funds, and asset aggregators."
3148,2020-09-01 19:31:05+00:00,tatianakoffman,4.2/ Decentralized Exchanges - Trading of securities and cryptocurrencies is typically done through platforms run by a third party. #DeFi exchanges eliminate middlemen and can act as a custodian of funds and digital assets in a peer-to-peer exchange.
3149,2020-09-01 19:30:49+00:00,tatianakoffman,"4.1/ Borrowing and Lending  - #DeFi allows a user to programmatically take out a loan, without an application or even a bank account. The lender is the smart contract itself and interest rates are calculated algorithmically based on supply and demand."
3150,2020-09-01 19:30:33+00:00,tatianakoffman,4/ There are 5 main categories dominating #DeFi today:
3151,2020-09-01 19:30:19+00:00,tatianakoffman,3/ The total value locked in #DeFi contracts is approximately $8 Billion.
3152,2020-09-01 19:30:03+00:00,tatianakoffman,"2/ The vast majority of these applications are currently created on #Ethereum, but in principle, other platforms with smart contract capabilities could work too. [I’m hearing @Tronfoundation is in the #DeFi game?]"
3153,2020-09-01 19:29:39+00:00,tatianakoffman,"1/ #DeFi stands for “Decentralized Finance”, which aims to recreate the traditional financial system with less, well, middlemen. Actions such as lending, borrowing, derivative products, buying and selling of securities, can now be done through a decentralized open-source network."
3154,2020-09-01 19:28:50+00:00,tatianakoffman,"0/ What I learned about #DeFi while writing my recent article @ForbesCrypto

4818,2020-06-12 14:39:24+00:00,tatianakoffman,@danheld This is actually true. The price for gold was backed by the labor you had to put in to increase its supply. Bitcoin is the same only with electricity.

The legacy financial system that we inherently trust has also given us plenty of fraud - see derivatives crisis."

If you choose to participate in crypto, it is your responsibility to keep safe by using multiple accounts, precautions and cold wallets. Rather than trusting in a third centralized party, you have to trust in yourself."

But if I’m buying a security token, chances are I’m looking for something more stable. There is also a question of low risk and high risk buckets in the greater portfolio."
5518,2019-03-20 17:31:05+00:00,tatianakoffman,@boironattorney Stablecoins obviously 🙌 Security Tokens carry their own investment risk profile without adding that of Bitcoin. This would be akin to investing in a government bond to receive distributions in oil.
