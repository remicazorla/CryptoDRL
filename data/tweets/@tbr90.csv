I‚Äôm saying QE actively prevented consumer price *deflation* post GFC in the way that QE/stimmy caused consumer price inflation

Widespread consumer inflation/deflation lags changes in asset prices"

2,2023-02-26 18:52:32+00:00,tbr90,@0xfoobar I‚Äôm not following your question. You think they won‚Äôt try to reclassify what is a healthy amount of inflation?
3,2023-02-26 18:48:10+00:00,tbr90,"@krugermacro We would have had large sustained deflation and asset price collapses if not for QEs post GFC

Are you denying that QEs supported asset prices and avoided a deflationary spiral that would‚Äôve caused deflation in core economy?"
4,2023-02-26 18:25:03+00:00,tbr90,@krugermacro Strong disagree. Sustained inflation starts w parking excess liquidity in assets and ends up working its way into the core economy. You cannot separate the two and the latter always follows the former.

No. To kill inflation, a small minority will be hit with job losses‚Ä¶"
