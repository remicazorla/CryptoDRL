966,2022-11-26 21:20:29+00:00,Excellion,The question is really how long DCG wants to hold out. Obviously they are trying to hold onto their golden goose (Grayscale) so the entire situation is less about desperation than maximization of value.
967,2022-11-26 21:20:28+00:00,Excellion,"DCG still has a number of good assets, including Grayscale, which generates somewhere along the lines of 500M to 800M a year on management fees. The likely outcome is either a restructuring or outright buyout by a bigger player."
968,2022-11-26 21:20:28+00:00,Excellion,"Some people are theorizing that Grayscale could be liquidated and the 634k BTC sold on the market, but to me that seems an unlikely outcome."
969,2022-11-26 21:20:27+00:00,Excellion,"Worst case would be that Genesis/DCG both go bankrupt. However, it seems unlikely, and it also wouldn‚Äôt be that bad because DCG still has strong revenues and assets. The Genesis/DCG scenario is very different from the FTX debacle, which is essentially theft and outright fraud."
970,2022-11-26 21:20:26+00:00,Excellion,"The bigger issue for Genesis now is a liquidity crunch due to a bank run triggered by overall contagion panic, paired with a maturity mismatch on their loans. Many of their loans are institutional and not no-notice recallable."

1465,2022-11-01 17:55:49+00:00,Excellion,"@nstate_eth So then you can look at the land registry as the blockchain and you only require a primary level audit. Any other tax system requires audits on some secondary level audit, disconnected from the main registry  (purchase receipts, inspections, accountants, tax lawyers, etc)."
1466,2022-11-01 17:53:08+00:00,Excellion,"@nstate_eth Thanks for the compliment and link :) 

It‚Äôs really just a logical deduction. You want to own land, so you would want your land in the registry to enforce your claim (unless you think occupation of land is ownership, in which case you can never go on vacation)."

2398,2022-09-07 11:18:58+00:00,Excellion,USDC and Circle have made many very high time preference strategic decisions to grow AUM in order to compete with Tether‚Äôs USDt (at least look like they compete).

3104,2022-07-02 19:38:20+00:00,Excellion,"Overall, this shake out is a good thing for #Bitcoin. Bitcoin investors will avoid lending, and shitcoiners will either shitcoin directly or by lending. There‚Äôs going to be far less Bitcoin being lend out, which means far less Bitcoin being used to suppress the BTC price."
3105,2022-07-02 19:38:20+00:00,Excellion,"The other way the industry survives, is that loans become completely P2P, like with @hodlhodl. You have a direct relationship with an over collateralized counterparty. If they blow themselves up, you‚Äôre protected."
3106,2022-07-02 19:38:19+00:00,Excellion,"Let‚Äôs say you deposit 2 BTC, you‚Äôd be in the 1% yield tier. Picking a steady Bitcoin price of $30k, you‚Äôd be making $600 on $60k. $600 for the chance to go to zero, instead of HODLing to $1M. If you want $600, just work the night shift for 40 hours a year at McD‚Äôs and earn it."
3107,2022-07-02 19:38:19+00:00,Excellion,"If the lending industry does survive, it‚Äôs likely going to change into just a CeFi bridge to DeFi, with little to no #Bitcoin involved in the system. No one will risk BTC for 1%. It will just be lending shitcoins to get shitcoin yield."
3108,2022-07-02 19:38:18+00:00,Excellion,"Even if you‚Äôre #Bitcoin only, these lending platform are not. They need to touch DeFi garbage somehow, maybe with unsecured loans, to access higher yields so they can give you a cut of the yield. So you‚Äôre in effect shitcoining by default."

And make no mistake, that is exactly what you're doing if you set either LOT=true or LOT=false as a default."
8714,2021-02-23 12:16:01+00:00,Excellion,@morcosa It's not the responsibility of the developers to guarantee that Taproot activates safely. It's the responsibly of the developers to ensure the code works and is bug free. The users (hodlers AND miners) will take care of the rest.
8715,2021-02-23 12:11:15+00:00,Excellion,"@morcosa There's an interesting type of ""observer effect"" at play here where you think you're trying to help steer things in the right direction and the safest direction, but in fact you're affecting the outcome, and possibly negatively, just by discussing it."
8716,2021-02-23 12:08:42+00:00,Excellion,"@morcosa Even the pools are not in agreement on the activation method, and that's okay. As per my suggestion on the mailing list, the best thing you can do is to remove yourselves from the equation. Provide both options. There's no need for a default."
8717,2021-02-23 12:06:02+00:00,Excellion,@morcosa I'm both a miner and a user and I'd like to see #Taproot activated without the possibility of a veto. Even mining pools have put together a website pushing for activation - with 88% for it. https://t.co/4OuXOXgXRp
8718,2021-02-23 12:02:52+00:00,Excellion,@morcosa I've been following the discussion on the mailing list and I find THAT to be incredibly disappointing. Why is the assumed that LOT=False is safer?

Uncertainty isn't a reason to have infinite inflation. As miners, we already deal with difficulty adjustments up or down. Remember BTC miners have skin in the game."

13515,2019-10-29 13:12:55+00:00,Excellion,@zndtoshi @udiWertheimer @giacomozucco I doubt it. Everyone knows Bcash is fake Bitcoin. Would be a national embarrassment to embrace it.
13516,2019-10-29 08:39:27+00:00,Excellion,@DoveyWan I wouldn't count him out yet. üòâ
13517,2019-10-29 07:55:04+00:00,Excellion,"@DoveyWan Yes, well a lot of things don't make sense. Can Jihan block a majority owner of the Beijing co from entering the premises? Or is this all a power play to try to finish the coup? Or will Micree go to court to regain access?"
13518,2019-10-29 07:52:32+00:00,Excellion,"It's possible that Jihan rounded shareholders to oust Micree, but needing to block Micree from entering the office, threatening employees to stop them from talking to him, in addition to Micree still being a corp manager, makes me feel that a #BitmainCivilWar is just starting."
13519,2019-10-29 07:47:53+00:00,Excellion,Jihan added Ge Yuesheng as a supervisor (Áõë‰∫ã) but then why not get rid of Micree completely? Note that Ge Yuesheng is a Bitmain shareholder and CEO of Jihan's Matrixport.
13520,2019-10-29 07:45:32+00:00,Excellion,I'm leaning towards the theory that the replacement of Micree as legal representative (Ê≥ïÂÆö‰ª£Ë°®‰∫∫) was NOT done with investor/shareholder approval because the change was messy. See below for the corp update. Micree was still left on as ÁªèÁêÜ (manager) which seems rushed. https://t.co/50lHgvilQx
13521,2019-10-29 07:40:27+00:00,Excellion,"The key is Bitmain's corporate structure. 

Cayman co
üîΩ
Hong Kong co
üîΩ
Beijing co

Hong Kong co's have a chop (like a stamp) so if Jihan had access to that, he could make the change to the legal structure of Beijing co without Micree actually agreeing to it."
13522,2019-10-29 07:37:09+00:00,Excellion,"So I originally thought Micree left on his own, because I thought the only way to change the legal rep is for the legal rep himself/herself to make the change, BUT it can be actually be done without consent!"
13523,2019-10-29 07:32:32+00:00,Excellion,"In the company meeting that just took place, Jihan also stated that Micree is barred from entering the Bitmain Beijing office. From all this, it sounds like everything was done very hastily and many things are still in play."
13524,2019-10-29 07:31:10+00:00,Excellion,"The original all staff email had very strong language saying that any employees meeting with Micree would be fired. Then, in a follow up email, Jihan said that the HR director that was fired before was re-hired, and the current one is now fired. üòÇ"
13525,2019-10-29 07:26:05+00:00,Excellion,"Actually, looks more like Micree was forced out. The question is how? Micree is still a majority shareholder of Bitmain Beijing as well a large shareholder of the parent Bitmain holding co. This looks like power play by Jihan &amp; still has yet to play out. #BitmainDrama #BitmainIPO"
13526,2019-10-29 05:04:46+00:00,Excellion,@richardbensberg Lost so much sleep over this offer.
13527,2019-10-29 05:03:25+00:00,Excellion,Interesting to note too that Jihan has replaced Micree as the legal representative of the company as well. I'd guess that Micree has decided to abandon the ship. #BitmainIPO https://t.co/gYrQhzl31H

There‚Äôll be other attacks someday &amp; they‚Äôll look insurmountable, but they are not. No one can force you to do anything. That‚Äôs what makes Bitcoin special. #UASF"

14158,2019-08-01 22:59:38+00:00,Excellion,The #UASF was a defining event of #Bitcoin. 2 years later we may forget what the movement looked like early on. It was never a sure thing.

Should've just used #Bitcoin."
14376,2019-07-17 07:08:30+00:00,Excellion,"Anytime you open the ""legitimate use"" door, it's all over. If the Libra Association decides x is not legitimate use, your money gets frozen or you get de-platformed. The senator concerned about center-right usage was so close to the mark."
14377,2019-07-17 07:05:42+00:00,Excellion,"""We wanted to ensure people, as long as they have a legitimate use of the product, can do what they want with their money.""

""Sorry, I only accept clean Libras in this store."" üôÑ"
14379,2019-07-17 06:59:20+00:00,Excellion,The only way for Libra to guarantee compliance in all areas is for it to be in complete control. You can't have only Calibra wallets requiring authenticated government ID's but not others. Only way it would work is with two pools of currency that are not allowed to intermingle.
14380,2019-07-17 06:54:26+00:00,Excellion,"Which would effectively render this statement void: ""Wallets will enforce the sanctions that are led by our national security apparatus and treasury."" The senators were so close in their questioning. If they connected these two points, it would have been much more interesting."
14381,2019-07-17 06:51:12+00:00,Excellion,"If this statement is really true, then a dev team will be able to remove the KYC/AML components in a non-Calibra wallet, and still be able to interact freely with the network aside from on and off ramps."

14383,2019-07-17 06:44:45+00:00,Excellion,"The crux of the issue is that Marcus has no idea what he is building, while also conflating FOSS with open permissionless systems. @Libra_ can't be everything for everyone, and it can't be both open and closed at the same time."
14384,2019-07-17 06:37:41+00:00,Excellion,"Let's ignore the funny parts for now, like ""we're really really a non-profit because we'll figure out how to make less money later"" or ""we want to keep America competitive by setting up shop in Switzerland."""

14938,2019-05-29 08:57:45+00:00,Excellion,14/ Toxicity is more complex than people that say things you don‚Äôt like. It can actually get really toxic to the point where it can affect people‚Äôs livelihoods.

14939,2019-05-29 08:56:52+00:00,Excellion,"13/ Now that's real toxicity &amp; it‚Äôs the kind you don‚Äôt easily get to see because it‚Äôs not on Twitter.

14941,2019-05-29 08:56:05+00:00,Excellion,"11/ It‚Äôs a market of ideas vs back room politics, much like #Bitcoin vs fiat. It‚Äôs funny how certain types of people that prefer those back room politics are also the ones that complain the loudest about toxicity."
14942,2019-05-29 08:55:26+00:00,Excellion,"10/ There are many different forms of toxicity too. I prefer #BitcoinTwitter open argument than methods like trying to silence people or getting them fired, which is just as toxic if not more.

14943,2019-05-29 08:54:04+00:00,Excellion,9/ ‚ÄúToxicity‚Äù is complicated. Should we be nice to Ver when he uses his Bitcoin account/website to scam people? Should we be nice to companies when they tell us we have no choice but to accept Garzik‚Äôs 2x fork? What is considered as toxic by one person may not be from another.
14944,2019-05-29 08:53:38+00:00,Excellion,"8/ Outside of Neil‚Äôs commentary, several parallel discussions were spawned from the Soona thread that went into ethnic diversity, gender dynamics, and toxicity in general. I only saw bits and pieces of those, and apparently it got pretty heated."
14945,2019-05-29 08:53:04+00:00,Excellion,"7/ (Ironically, Matt enjoys the luxury to say what he likes at his current employer.) Matt continued to complain &amp; I told him not to bother me on my weekend &amp; that we can talk next week. I guess he didn‚Äôt like that because on Monday he started the started the drama.

14947,2019-05-29 08:52:23+00:00,Excellion,5/ Matt messaged me directly to complain about Neil and told me to ‚Äúkeep him in line.‚Äù Neil reports to me and heads up our marketing team. I told Matt that I don‚Äôt police the thoughts of my team and that they are free to express their own opinions.
14948,2019-05-29 08:51:42+00:00,Excellion,4/ I don‚Äôt disagree with anything that @nwoodfine said. Neil is level headed &amp; simply pointing out the realties of the space. I believe his commentary was related to this tweet (https://t.co/inGQkj1vkp) &amp; how we may lose ‚Äúbright‚Äù devs to ETH because Bitcoiners aren‚Äôt nice enough.
14949,2019-05-29 08:51:08+00:00,Excellion,"3/ The starting point was this thread from @nwoodfine https://t.co/0YnQFsnWHH. TL;DR: #Bitcoin is very important, attracts scammers and frauds, &amp; a culture has evolved to defend against bad actors / attacks. He went on to say if you can't accept that culture then too bad."
