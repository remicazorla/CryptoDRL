492,2023-01-04 09:56:58+00:00,Excellion,"The most important thing is that we continually expand the understanding of #Bitcoin &amp; sound money.

While #Bitcoin conferences are fun and it's always great to see and meet everyone, it's also preaching to the choir."

966,2022-11-26 21:20:29+00:00,Excellion,The question is really how long DCG wants to hold out. Obviously they are trying to hold onto their golden goose (Grayscale) so the entire situation is less about desperation than maximization of value.
967,2022-11-26 21:20:28+00:00,Excellion,"DCG still has a number of good assets, including Grayscale, which generates somewhere along the lines of 500M to 800M a year on management fees. The likely outcome is either a restructuring or outright buyout by a bigger player."
968,2022-11-26 21:20:28+00:00,Excellion,"Some people are theorizing that Grayscale could be liquidated and the 634k BTC sold on the market, but to me that seems an unlikely outcome."
969,2022-11-26 21:20:27+00:00,Excellion,"Worst case would be that Genesis/DCG both go bankrupt. However, it seems unlikely, and it also wouldn’t be that bad because DCG still has strong revenues and assets. The Genesis/DCG scenario is very different from the FTX debacle, which is essentially theft and outright fraud."
970,2022-11-26 21:20:26+00:00,Excellion,"The bigger issue for Genesis now is a liquidity crunch due to a bank run triggered by overall contagion panic, paired with a maturity mismatch on their loans. Many of their loans are institutional and not no-notice recallable."
971,2022-11-26 21:20:25+00:00,Excellion,"My comments on Genesis/DCG were paraphrased a lot in the Wired article. TL;DR is Genesis/DCG is a very different animal than FTX. DCG group has real assets and revenue generating lines of business. The issue is primarily a liquidity crunch.

1462,2022-11-01 17:59:51+00:00,Excellion,@nstate_eth Welcome :) Good chat!
1463,2022-11-01 17:58:02+00:00,Excellion,"@nstate_eth Following the blockchain analogy, military defense, or protection of borders, would be like PoW. Tax on land is akin to paying for security."
1464,2022-11-01 17:56:17+00:00,Excellion,"@nstate_eth So in effect you’d be trying to audit a layer 2 like the Lightning Network, which is challenging and imperfect."
1465,2022-11-01 17:55:49+00:00,Excellion,"@nstate_eth So then you can look at the land registry as the blockchain and you only require a primary level audit. Any other tax system requires audits on some secondary level audit, disconnected from the main registry  (purchase receipts, inspections, accountants, tax lawyers, etc)."
1466,2022-11-01 17:53:08+00:00,Excellion,"@nstate_eth Thanks for the compliment and link :) 

It’s really just a logical deduction. You want to own land, so you would want your land in the registry to enforce your claim (unless you think occupation of land is ownership, in which case you can never go on vacation)."
1467,2022-11-01 17:37:40+00:00,Excellion,@nstate_eth Interesting. Didn’t know that it was an economic philosophy. I was just thinking of the simplest and most foolproof method for tax collection.

1474,2022-11-01 17:05:19+00:00,Excellion,“Miserable corncob” is accurate. 😂😂😂
1475,2022-11-01 03:17:04+00:00,Excellion,@_Crypt0Jack @LynAldenContact Sure luxury cars and liquor sound great. Tomorrow flying cars. Then interplanetary travel.
1476,2022-11-01 03:15:23+00:00,Excellion,@_Crypt0Jack @LynAldenContact Yes exactly. The temptation to tax more and more is too great. Historically we also see it just snowballs time and time again.
1477,2022-11-01 03:14:01+00:00,Excellion,"@LynAldenContact Well, we’re just theorizing about an ideal model right now, but if real estate taxes are not enough, the government should engage in revenue generating activities, like mining #Bitcoin. In Canada you have Crown Corps."
1478,2022-11-01 03:06:26+00:00,Excellion,"@LynAldenContact If your goal as stated in your thread is to minimize surveillance, then land seems to be the best option to tax since you already rely on the government to maintain the registry. Do you own it? Yes? Tax it then. Everything else is just asking for more complexity."
1479,2022-11-01 03:04:38+00:00,Excellion,"@LynAldenContact They require surveillance of some type which brings us right back to the overly complex systems we have now. If you’ve ever ordered something overseas and had to pay duty, then you know how annoying that whole process is and how arbitrary it can be."
1480,2022-11-01 03:02:28+00:00,Excellion,"@LynAldenContact Taxing land aligns incentives to increase overall value of real estate - better services, infrastructure, safety, etc. It’s simple and straightforward. Taxing imports and tourism adds friction to economic activity and is imperfect. These things are “visible” but…"

2389,2022-09-07 17:45:06+00:00,Excellion,"@VitalikButerin Not in the way described. A TTD is set, then that TTD is manually replaced by a second one when someone decides it’s a good time. So who “feeds” the second one to node operators? How exactly does that feeding work? Discord channel?"
2390,2022-09-07 11:27:19+00:00,Excellion,"@zndtoshi Yes, the final TTD came after the article, but the article still describes the mechanism correctly."
2391,2022-09-07 11:19:06+00:00,Excellion,"So in summary:

- USDC will lose AUM, volume, and mindshare
- BUSD will gain those
- BUSD will take USDCs place as #2 
- Binance might add fees later for BUSD minting and redemption as a defensive measure
- USDt will remain the King of Stablecoins 👑"
2392,2022-09-07 11:19:06+00:00,Excellion,"This is a bold move from Binance. I’d expect nothing less from CZ. 😁

I could see other exchanges taking the play and trying it out themselves too. Perhaps Gemini? Auto convert USDC to GUSD? 

Eventually everyone is going to need to charge for mint/redeem to avert this attack."
2393,2022-09-07 11:19:05+00:00,Excellion,"Now, why can’t Binance do the same to Tether? It’s not because USDt is “not cash equivalent.” It is. This attack doesn’t work on Tether is because they charge 10 bps on both minting and redemption. They always have from day 1. No one’s taking @paoloardoino’s candy away from him."
2394,2022-09-07 11:19:05+00:00,Excellion,"Sorry, Jeremy, I’m not so sure about that. https://t.co/ehA9dSU18Y"
2395,2022-09-07 11:19:03+00:00,Excellion,"Also, this is far more than just consolidation of trading pairs. It’s the outright purge of USDC from the Binance ecosystem. USDC is also no longer available in their lending and payment offerings. That’s a massive hit. How can anyone say this is a good thing? https://t.co/Tmz0Zm39p0"
2396,2022-09-07 11:19:01+00:00,Excellion,"Because Binance can mint and redeem USDC for free, they can just take USDC reserves for themselves. We’re going to see both a decline in USDC trading volume AND AUM, while BUSD gains on both fronts. It’s like talking candy from a baby. 🍭👶"
2397,2022-09-07 11:19:00+00:00,Excellion,"One of those decisions was free minting and redemption of USDC. This removes friction for users and is good to attract more customers, but it’s also a double edged sword. Binance can use that same mechanic to take out a major competitor in the stablecoin game. It’s an attack. https://t.co/2IuQXJFpif"
2398,2022-09-07 11:18:58+00:00,Excellion,USDC and Circle have made many very high time preference strategic decisions to grow AUM in order to compete with Tether’s USDt (at least look like they compete). It’s the standard Silicon Valley playbook: burn lots of cash to grow fast and figure out the business model later.
2399,2022-09-07 11:18:58+00:00,Excellion,"I’m seeing a lot of people trying to put a positive spin on Binance’s forced conversions of USDC to BUSD. You can say it’s good UX for USDC users, but that’s neither here nor there. This is the beginning of the end for USDC. 🧵"

2404,2022-09-07 09:03:13+00:00,Excellion,Any search on the topic of the Merge comes back with lots articles about how important it is but none focus on HOW this change happens in a supposedly decentralized network.

3104,2022-07-02 19:38:20+00:00,Excellion,"Overall, this shake out is a good thing for #Bitcoin. Bitcoin investors will avoid lending, and shitcoiners will either shitcoin directly or by lending. There’s going to be far less Bitcoin being lend out, which means far less Bitcoin being used to suppress the BTC price."
3105,2022-07-02 19:38:20+00:00,Excellion,"The other way the industry survives, is that loans become completely P2P, like with @hodlhodl. You have a direct relationship with an over collateralized counterparty. If they blow themselves up, you’re protected."
3106,2022-07-02 19:38:19+00:00,Excellion,"Let’s say you deposit 2 BTC, you’d be in the 1% yield tier. Picking a steady Bitcoin price of $30k, you’d be making $600 on $60k. $600 for the chance to go to zero, instead of HODLing to $1M. If you want $600, just work the night shift for 40 hours a year at McD’s and earn it."
3107,2022-07-02 19:38:19+00:00,Excellion,"If the lending industry does survive, it’s likely going to change into just a CeFi bridge to DeFi, with little to no #Bitcoin involved in the system. No one will risk BTC for 1%. It will just be lending shitcoins to get shitcoin yield."
3108,2022-07-02 19:38:18+00:00,Excellion,"Even if you’re #Bitcoin only, these lending platform are not. They need to touch DeFi garbage somehow, maybe with unsecured loans, to access higher yields so they can give you a cut of the yield. So you’re in effect shitcoining by default."

3993,2022-04-25 03:22:31+00:00,Excellion,@Bas_02 @mcnicollme @hodlonaut @InfiniteFleet The rewards should be very similar to your own. Actually your main fleet is technically at risk too unless you go to a station. If you just log out your ships stay right where they are and open to attack. Big raids prob can’t be automated. It’s more for routine tasks.
3994,2022-04-25 03:04:50+00:00,Excellion,@Bas_02 @mcnicollme @hodlonaut @InfiniteFleet The first version of the game will be PvE so that should help. PvP may be ready in a few years so by then we should have a lot of good structure to help noobs.

4004,2022-04-24 00:24:58+00:00,Excellion,@Bas_02 @mcnicollme @hodlonaut @InfiniteFleet Yes for multiple ships/fleets. The goal should be for players to have a single account where they collect and upgrade lots of ships. Ships will be assembled into fleets. Players can control one fleet and send others on AFK missions to level up and perform various tasks.
4005,2022-04-24 00:23:29+00:00,Excellion,"@Bas_02 @mcnicollme @hodlonaut @InfiniteFleet Overall I would say IF will be very hardcore in that the things you build can be attacked and destroyed, but it won’t be a hardcore grind. You won’t lose ships (or weapons) unless you go to special zones and then it’s a balance of risk/reward."
4006,2022-04-24 00:12:08+00:00,Excellion,@Bas_02 @mcnicollme @hodlonaut @InfiniteFleet The rewards will be lasting because achievements will be written into the Lore as part of the directed narrative feature.

The issue with L2 was the difficult grind to level up. A lot of IF systems will be just managed processes - like mining. You setup mining and it runs itself but you monitor it from a mobile app.

They can mint 1-of-1's or multiple editions of their artwork, set reserve pricing, and a buy out price. Artists can also decide to collect royalties on future sales of their artwork. 🎨"

You keep positioning users against miners and this line of thinking may cause miners to believe that LOT=true is some insult towards them, when it is not."
8706,2021-02-23 12:50:18+00:00,Excellion,@ajtowns @morcosa I'm not stirring things up. I'm reading the room.
8707,2021-02-23 12:44:46+00:00,Excellion,@MrHodl @morcosa If we need the devs to keep us in consensus why bother with PoW at all?
8708,2021-02-23 12:43:49+00:00,Excellion,@morcosa And the UASF was one of the greatest episodes in #Bitcoin history. The users brought companies like Bitmain and Coinbase to their knees. https://t.co/EvtlnKmsJ2
8709,2021-02-23 12:41:58+00:00,Excellion,"@morcosa My point is that if the devs don't release a version with LOT=true, someone else will do that. I think it's fine to discuss it, but the whole thing distills down to one group saying ""it's not needed yet"" and the other going ""we need it."" Let the market decide."
8710,2021-02-23 12:34:29+00:00,Excellion,"@morcosa It will happen regardless of what you do at this point. Didn't you pay attention to what happened with the #UASF? The longer you keep discussing it, the worse it gets."

8712,2021-02-23 12:27:38+00:00,Excellion,@itsLIRAN Because they know better than us. /s
8713,2021-02-23 12:25:27+00:00,Excellion,"@morcosa Even if you disagree with me, you can't disagree with the fact that you'll get nowhere trying to force a decision onto #Bitcoiners that are obsessed with self-sovereignty. And make no mistake, that is exactly what you're doing if you set either LOT=true or LOT=false as a default."
8714,2021-02-23 12:16:01+00:00,Excellion,@morcosa It's not the responsibility of the developers to guarantee that Taproot activates safely. It's the responsibly of the developers to ensure the code works and is bug free. The users (hodlers AND miners) will take care of the rest.
8715,2021-02-23 12:11:15+00:00,Excellion,"@morcosa There's an interesting type of ""observer effect"" at play here where you think you're trying to help steer things in the right direction and the safest direction, but in fact you're affecting the outcome, and possibly negatively, just by discussing it."
8716,2021-02-23 12:08:42+00:00,Excellion,"@morcosa Even the pools are not in agreement on the activation method, and that's okay. As per my suggestion on the mailing list, the best thing you can do is to remove yourselves from the equation. Provide both options. There's no need for a default."
8717,2021-02-23 12:06:02+00:00,Excellion,@morcosa I'm both a miner and a user and I'd like to see #Taproot activated without the possibility of a veto. Even mining pools have put together a website pushing for activation - with 88% for it. https://t.co/4OuXOXgXRp
8718,2021-02-23 12:02:52+00:00,Excellion,@morcosa I've been following the discussion on the mailing list and I find THAT to be incredibly disappointing. Why is the assumed that LOT=False is safer? Why is everyone afraid of upsetting miners? Stop making a distinction between miners and users. You're actively seeding discord.

9171,2021-01-20 07:36:43+00:00,Excellion,"We’re very grateful for all of our show and conference sponsors. You know who you are! Also the fans and haters that watched us over the years too. @magicalcrypto will never really go away though. What is cringe may never die. Also, the plushies are always watching you.

❤️🦁"
9172,2021-01-20 07:36:43+00:00,Excellion,"So live shows are over, but you can still expect a bit more content coming out. We still have more recordings from #MCCVR to release, and we still have a final animated short that we had been saving. And who knows, another MCC could be possible in the future!"
9173,2021-01-20 07:36:43+00:00,Excellion,"And it has gotten a lot harder to schedule the recordings in the last few months. Everyone is busier than before. For me, after the show this morning, I’ve been in meetings and calls until now. Things are getting busier with @InfiniteFleet and @Blockstream. 😴"
9174,2021-01-20 07:36:42+00:00,Excellion,"As @WayneVaughan said, it’s the end of an era, but it’s not that bad. We’ll still be around. Just it’s better to go out with a bang than fizzle out because we’re not doing an episode a month anymore."
9175,2021-01-20 07:36:42+00:00,Excellion,"During the last show we talked about reasons why we started the show in the first place, to address FUD and bad takes (and have fun). I think we’ve done a good job of it, and somehow the FUD just keeps getting recycled so we don’t need to do more - just rewatch old eps!"
9176,2021-01-20 07:36:42+00:00,Excellion,"We also made a ton of cool swag along the way, with collectible coins, stuffed animals, and even plastic figurines. Not too bad for a podcast where 4 friends just discuss what’s happening!"
9177,2021-01-20 07:36:41+00:00,Excellion,"Even MCC was something we just decided to do casually, despite having no experience in running conferences, and it turned out pretty great! We pushed even more boundaries with MCCVR and pulled off a magical conference that was unlike anything else. Ahem, @udiWertheimer."
9178,2021-01-20 07:36:40+00:00,Excellion,"3 years, 42 episodes, and a lot of corny jokes later, @magicalcrypto is over! It was an honor and a blast doing the show with @SatoshiLite, @WhalePanda, and @fluffypony. What started out on a whim turned into so much more."

9184,2021-01-19 04:11:50+00:00,Excellion,@Lynxabi @INXLimited There's a lot more possible with @Liquid_BTC securities than with traditional stocks than just trading hours. You can have atomic swaps for P2P security token trades too. Happy to answer anytime.
9185,2021-01-19 03:05:05+00:00,Excellion,"@Lynxabi No, it will only be able to be traded on security token exchanges like @INXLimited etc. There's value in tokenization as investors can do P2P trades, trading is 24/7, and increased liquidity vs traditional stocks."

9190,2021-01-19 02:09:59+00:00,Excellion,"@Lynxabi @alansilbert It would've been easier for us to crowdfund - far less legal overhead. However, I believe security tokens will drive a reformation of capital markets &amp; deliver more value to investors. Traditional equity raises are also illiquid - EXO is liquid from day one (pardon the pun)."
9191,2021-01-19 02:09:35+00:00,Excellion,"@Lynxabi @alansilbert Crowdfunding is possible, but it isn't as good for the players. Take Star Citizen for example, everyone funding it is simply donating money to the developer. With a security, anyone planning to play the game can also be an investor in that game. It's a superior value proposition."
9192,2021-01-19 02:08:53+00:00,Excellion,"@Lynxabi @alansilbert It's a security token - so a security, but also tokenized. EXOeu has an ISIN, so it could be traded on traditional exchanges as well. VC's are bad at investing in games - they lack the skillset to evaluate something that isn't an app. To them it's like investing in a movie."

11780,2020-05-21 08:26:21+00:00,Excellion,@SatoshiLite @adam3us @magicalcrypto @WhalePanda @fluffypony @halfin @NickSzabo4 Sure but we shouldn’t fault him for not releasing either. The emails were very boring. Adam let some people see them. It’s typical dry discourse as per Satoshi.
11781,2020-05-21 07:35:47+00:00,Excellion,@SatoshiLite @WhalePanda @magicalcrypto @adam3us @fluffypony Patoshi could also be a non-public third party that wanted to help but do so discreetly.

11783,2020-05-21 06:31:11+00:00,Excellion,@SatoshiLite @fluffypony @magicalcrypto @adam3us @WhalePanda Actually a few other addresses he claimed have had the coins spent out of them in 2019. He’s screwed.
11784,2020-05-21 06:26:12+00:00,Excellion,@SatoshiLite @WhalePanda @magicalcrypto @adam3us @fluffypony If I were Satoshi I would be mining alongside the patoshi machines to obscure ownership. So it’s always a possibility.

11786,2020-05-21 06:10:55+00:00,Excellion,@SatoshiLite @magicalcrypto @adam3us @WhalePanda @fluffypony Why do you think @halfin or @NickSzabo4 are not Satoshi candidates? I think any of them could have been Satoshi. But there is no way to definitively proof or disprove them.
11787,2020-05-21 05:59:14+00:00,Excellion,@SatoshiLite @magicalcrypto @adam3us @WhalePanda @fluffypony Well the thing is Adam could very well be Satoshi. He fits the profile. Has the same skills and interests. Worked on networking code. Codes for Windows. And he is actually far more advanced than Satoshi in terms of applied cryptography.
11788,2020-05-21 05:12:26+00:00,Excellion,"@SatoshiLite @magicalcrypto @adam3us @WhalePanda @fluffypony Because we are all Satoshi Nakamoto, except for CSW."

12165,2020-04-17 21:58:09+00:00,Excellion,"@WayneVaughan @gladstein Why would it? Exchanges that support LN deposit and withdrawals should also be targeted then. You can be both compliant with KYC/AML and protect the privacy of your customers. If we can't do that, then something is very wrong."

12172,2020-04-16 23:20:27+00:00,Excellion,"Fun Fact: The London workshop where #P2EP was conceptualized, started from a conversation that @adam3us and I had while stuck in traffic during Blockchain Week NYC in 2018. We set up the workshop and P2EP was announced shortly after in August 2018."
12173,2020-04-16 23:10:00+00:00,Excellion,"Financial privacy in #Bitcoin will require widespread adoption. I can’t see #Bitcoin co’s supporting ‘CoinJoins’ but I could see them supporting ‘P2EP.’ It’s just less politically charged. 

Let’s make it happen! Talk to the businesses &amp; services you use. Demand #P2EP support. 🔒"
12174,2020-04-16 23:10:00+00:00,Excellion,"It's better to present #P2EP as a privacy preserving tech to the masses and use simpler messaging:

“We’re adding P2EP to protect the privacy of our users.” 

Keep it simple."
12175,2020-04-16 23:09:59+00:00,Excellion,"On naming, I prefer #P2EP over #PayJoin. PayJoin, while catchy, is reminiscent of #CoinJoin, which has certain connotations and baggage, as well as a subpar track record of actually improving fungibility (it’s easy to ID CJs). #P2EP is far better at accomplishing its goals."
12176,2020-04-16 23:09:59+00:00,Excellion,"The goal here is a to establish #P2EP as a common standard across wallets and #Bitcoin services. Protocol level changes to improve privacy and fungibility will be challenging, but right now we can make huge strides forward with widespread #P2EP adoption. Do what you can, today."
12177,2020-04-16 23:09:59+00:00,Excellion,"#P2EP support in light wallets isn’t enough as the receiving party needs to be online too. However, merchants are an ideal group for a beachhead. Much like the #LiquidNetwork, building traction &amp; network effects starts with a strong base. Exchanges for Liquid, merchants for P2EP."
12178,2020-04-16 23:09:55+00:00,Excellion,"A lot of time had passed with little progress on #P2EP adoption as a common standard, so we decided to jumpstart it with the @BtcpayServer team. My strategy was to create a pool of anchor tenants for #BlockstreamGreen &amp; other light wallet users to transact with. 🔒⛓"

Bailouts help megacorps like airlines that blew cash on stock buybacks. Relief programs rely on someone determining need and priority.
12405,2020-03-22 04:25:12+00:00,Excellion,@lowstrife Refund taxes from 2019 then. At least then it’s based on your contributions.
12406,2020-03-22 04:22:04+00:00,Excellion,@LukeDashjr @nntaleb Best way is to refund income tax paid. People get back what they put in. That is the most equitable distribution method.

13288,2019-12-10 06:24:15+00:00,Excellion,"@kixunil @jordankittle @bradmillscan @DoItForCoin It was an attack of course. He dug up a photo of her with her friend from a time before we even met.

It's the same deck, but @coindesk fact checked before they published. I guess this is how police raids can be conjured out of thin air. Like I said yesterday, journalism is tough.😂"

13294,2019-12-10 02:18:33+00:00,Excellion,"This is gold. I said The Block didn't SPEAK to anyone at Blockstream or BTSE. I didn't say they didn't reach out. It's the responsibility of reporters to verify facts before reporting. If no one in the industry talks to you because you antagonize everyone, it's a separate issue."
13295,2019-12-10 01:03:26+00:00,Excellion,"@coindesk At this point, I think even if The Block reached out to people for comment and verification, few would even bother to talk to them. I know I'd just ignore their mails. 😅"
13296,2019-12-10 00:59:21+00:00,Excellion,"Fun to watch this news break from behind the scenes. The Block posted their ""scoop"" around 9 AM. They spoke to no one at Blockstream or BTSE. @coindesk reporters spoke to staff at both co's &amp; posted soon after. TL;DR: wait a few hours &amp; get accurate news without paying The Block!"

Bitcoin = BTC?
or
Bitcoin = BSV?

You have a person claiming to be Satoshi with no evidence, US judges ruling against his stories, a trail of fraudulent evidence, etc. A “maybe” means you’re saying Bitcoin might be BSV."

13516,2019-10-29 08:39:27+00:00,Excellion,@DoveyWan I wouldn't count him out yet. 😉
13517,2019-10-29 07:55:04+00:00,Excellion,"@DoveyWan Yes, well a lot of things don't make sense. Can Jihan block a majority owner of the Beijing co from entering the premises? Or is this all a power play to try to finish the coup? Or will Micree go to court to regain access?"
13518,2019-10-29 07:52:32+00:00,Excellion,"It's possible that Jihan rounded shareholders to oust Micree, but needing to block Micree from entering the office, threatening employees to stop them from talking to him, in addition to Micree still being a corp manager, makes me feel that a #BitmainCivilWar is just starting."
13519,2019-10-29 07:47:53+00:00,Excellion,Jihan added Ge Yuesheng as a supervisor (监事) but then why not get rid of Micree completely? Note that Ge Yuesheng is a Bitmain shareholder and CEO of Jihan's Matrixport.
13520,2019-10-29 07:45:32+00:00,Excellion,I'm leaning towards the theory that the replacement of Micree as legal representative (法定代表人) was NOT done with investor/shareholder approval because the change was messy. See below for the corp update. Micree was still left on as 经理 (manager) which seems rushed. https://t.co/50lHgvilQx
13521,2019-10-29 07:40:27+00:00,Excellion,"The key is Bitmain's corporate structure. 

Cayman co
🔽
Hong Kong co
🔽
Beijing co

Hong Kong co's have a chop (like a stamp) so if Jihan had access to that, he could make the change to the legal structure of Beijing co without Micree actually agreeing to it."
13522,2019-10-29 07:37:09+00:00,Excellion,"So I originally thought Micree left on his own, because I thought the only way to change the legal rep is for the legal rep himself/herself to make the change, BUT it can be actually be done without consent!"
13523,2019-10-29 07:32:32+00:00,Excellion,"In the company meeting that just took place, Jihan also stated that Micree is barred from entering the Bitmain Beijing office. From all this, it sounds like everything was done very hastily and many things are still in play."
13524,2019-10-29 07:31:10+00:00,Excellion,"The original all staff email had very strong language saying that any employees meeting with Micree would be fired. Then, in a follow up email, Jihan said that the HR director that was fired before was re-hired, and the current one is now fired. 😂"
13525,2019-10-29 07:26:05+00:00,Excellion,"Actually, looks more like Micree was forced out. The question is how? Micree is still a majority shareholder of Bitmain Beijing as well a large shareholder of the parent Bitmain holding co. This looks like power play by Jihan &amp; still has yet to play out. #BitmainDrama #BitmainIPO"

14100,2019-08-08 23:04:46+00:00,Excellion,"@Blockstream @adam3us That's why it was important that we started #BlockstreamPool development in 2018. I had hoped BetterHash would gain traction, but as there was none, the next best choice was to launch a new pool. Having built up BTCC Pool before, there was no reason I couldn't do it again. 😁"
14101,2019-08-08 22:58:37+00:00,Excellion,@Blockstream @adam3us Pair that transparent hosting with the BetterHash #BlockstreamPool and it means you can run a full-node at home to create block templates for your miners in our facilities. The pool cannot use your hashrate to censor transactions or signal support for things like Segwit2x.
14102,2019-08-08 22:54:46+00:00,Excellion,@Blockstream @adam3us It's idealistic to think everyone will mine at home because of power costs making it impractical - not to mention the risk dealing with mining hardware that runs hot. #BlockstreamMining provides an option to host and manage with our dashboard to have accurate metering &amp; billing.

Acesss to an enterprise grade colo option in a geopolitically stable region is huge. Right now we can only service large customers but our goal is to serve smaller miners as well."
14104,2019-08-08 22:39:38+00:00,Excellion,@Blockstream @adam3us Many miners tried to source power when #Bitcoin was peaking late 2017/early 2018 and it led to a massive backlog of demand.

14153,2019-08-01 23:46:10+00:00,Excellion,"2 years later, as we enjoy this prosperous era of #Bitcoin with tech advancing rapidly, #RememberTheUASF &amp; the lessons. There’ll be other attacks someday &amp; they’ll look insurmountable, but they are not. No one can force you to do anything. That’s what makes Bitcoin special. #UASF"
14154,2019-08-01 23:34:23+00:00,Excellion,"We also learned that Core devs are not “in charge” as some proclaim. Remember, many devs were very much against #UASF/#BIP148 and consisdered it dangerous. In #Bitcoin, the users decide. You run the software you choose. We can opt-out of contentious changes or forced consensus."
14155,2019-08-01 23:23:31+00:00,Excellion,"We learned that miner signaling is meaningless because hashrate does not decide what #Bitcoin is. We learned that corporations cannot unilaterally make decisions for Bitcoiners. They can try to make us think they can, but we’d really just be voluntarily giving up our sovereignty."
14156,2019-08-01 23:18:00+00:00,Excellion,"As @BrianLockhart says, “it was a white knuckle time to be a hodler.” Indeed. But we had to go through it. The #UASF was a collective learning experience for both sides involved (except the select few that are still unable to admit fault), to really learn why #Bitcoin is Bitcoin."
14157,2019-08-01 23:12:16+00:00,Excellion,All revolutionary movements start small. People started to organize &amp; coordinate. Code was written. Memes were made. Hats were manufactured. Momentum started to build. Eventually the #UASF won the day. It was never a sure thing but we were 100% committed and that’s what mattered.
14158,2019-08-01 22:59:38+00:00,Excellion,The #UASF was a defining event of #Bitcoin. 2 years later we may forget what the movement looked like early on. It was never a sure thing. Many people were confused &amp; felt powerless in the face of what looked like massive support for a forced protocol change (NYA/#SegWit2x).

14532,2019-07-03 01:58:17+00:00,Excellion,Roubini: Banks have invested billions on #blockchain proof of concepts and haven’t found a single use case. 😄
14533,2019-07-03 01:56:43+00:00,Excellion,"Roubini: Libra is not a cryptocurrency. It’s not a #blockchain. It’s going to be permissioned, not permissionless."
14534,2019-07-03 01:54:18+00:00,Excellion,Hayes: If you want to be an asshat or a charlatan you can get away with it for a while. @rogerkver
14535,2019-07-03 01:53:21+00:00,Excellion,Hayes: #Bitcoin is the only real free market that’s left in the world.
14536,2019-07-03 01:52:49+00:00,Excellion,Now we interrupt this thread for a brief message from our sponsor. Remember that you can make rapid deposits and withdrawals on @BitMEXdotcom using the #LiquidNetwork! 🌊 https://t.co/C64Y7i7gFU
14537,2019-07-03 01:49:44+00:00,Excellion,Roubini: Bitcoin dropped 30% in one week. No wonder this conference doesn’t accept Bitcoin. 😂
14538,2019-07-03 01:47:55+00:00,Excellion,"Hayes: If you choose to buy a #shitcoin that goes to zero, that’s your problem."
14539,2019-07-03 01:44:47+00:00,Excellion,Roubini: Stop the banking the unbanked bullshit. Pretending to provide services to the poor and stealing their money.
14540,2019-07-03 01:42:08+00:00,Excellion,Hayes: Is #Bitcoin being used to buy a cup of coffee? No.
14541,2019-07-03 01:40:27+00:00,Excellion,Roubini just said the Quadriga CEO pretended to die. 😅
14542,2019-07-03 01:37:37+00:00,Excellion,Hayes: Don’t store your #Bitcoin on an exchange you don’t need to fucking trade with. (Or use the #LiquidNetwork to move them on and off quickly) 😉
14543,2019-07-03 01:35:28+00:00,Excellion,Roubini: Mining is an oligopoly. All trading is on centralized exchanges. Massive concentration of wealth. It’s not decentralized. It’s bullshit.
14544,2019-07-03 01:32:23+00:00,Excellion,"Hayes: Privacy is expensive and if you value it, you have to pay for it."
14545,2019-07-03 01:30:41+00:00,Excellion,Roubini: something something something stinking shitcoins.
14546,2019-07-03 01:29:59+00:00,Excellion,Roubini harping on 5 tps for #Bitcoin. Still doesn’t know about the #LightningNetwork.
14547,2019-07-03 01:27:24+00:00,Excellion,Andrew Neil (referee) just shouted at Roubini to be quiet. 😅
14548,2019-07-03 01:25:35+00:00,Excellion,It’s hard to understand Roubini’s accent. Almost as bad as @WhalePanda’s.
14549,2019-07-03 01:23:27+00:00,Excellion,Roubini: He’s just making money off of retail suckers.
14550,2019-07-03 01:21:49+00:00,Excellion,@CryptoHayes: I don’t even want to call you professsor.
14551,2019-07-03 01:20:29+00:00,Excellion,Organizers said no photos of the Hayes vs Roubini debate so I’ll use this stock photo of Nouriel. #ABS2019 @aba_summit https://t.co/mVWQXziwXq

14913,2019-05-30 02:38:49+00:00,Excellion,11/ No one at Blockstream has ever said “let's be mean just because it's fun” as Matt suggested. Some of us don’t take things too seriously because there are many social attacks and crazy conspiracy theories out there. Don’t conflate irreverence and satire with malice.
14914,2019-05-30 02:38:21+00:00,Excellion,10/ But the world is complicated and things are multi-faceted - there is “mean on the Internet” and there is really evil stuff like trying to silence critics by bankrupting them or getting them fired. Would it be better if everyone was nice? Sure. We don't disagree there at all.
14915,2019-05-30 02:37:50+00:00,Excellion,"9/ I can see how it's easy for Matt to lash out in anger &amp; blame me for ""the worst parts of Bitcoin culture.” Ironically, that’s analogous to what many Bitcoin company CEO’s did when blaming Core devs for not increasing block size. It’s an oversimplification to get a mob going."
14916,2019-05-30 02:37:27+00:00,Excellion,"8/ The repercussions from Gavin’s actions have done far more damage than anything mean anyone said. In case you didn't get the memo, #Faketoshi is now suing people for speaking out and actively trying to bankrupt @PeterMcCormack &amp; @hodlonaut by taking them to court."
14917,2019-05-30 02:37:03+00:00,Excellion,"7/ Were we wrong to lambaste Gavin? I don’t think so. Given that Gavin is the one that legitimized #Faketoshi &amp; helped elevate him, I wear the toxic label from Gavin with pride. People need to be able to speak freely to combat the really nasty stuff in the Bitcoin space."
14918,2019-05-30 02:36:16+00:00,Excellion,"6/ When Gavin blasted Greg and I for being ""toxic,"" I had only been at Blockstream for 1 month. Did I corrupt it that quickly? Damn I'm good. https://t.co/xuhFMcFce9"
14919,2019-05-30 02:35:34+00:00,Excellion,"5/ In fact, according to r/btc, Matt's also in the running for “ultimate bitcoin troll status” just after Greg &amp; Luke https://t.co/Z8Cey2EBQo. So from someone’s view, Blockstream was always the villain, and that includes Matt. As I said yesterday, “toxicity” is very complicated."
14920,2019-05-30 02:32:04+00:00,Excellion,3/ Blockstream is far more than the handful of people he knew when he left. I’m not the only one growing the team - there are new hires in all departments &amp; everyone is working VERY hard to build something meaningful.
14921,2019-05-30 02:30:48+00:00,Excellion,"2/ If you have a problem with individuals, go talk to them directly or block them. That would be the mature thing to do, instead of venting in our general direction. As he said, he's a co-founder; his words carry more weight than some random so he needs to be far more tactful."
14922,2019-05-30 02:28:55+00:00,Excellion,"1/ @TheBlueMatt can single me out if he wants, but it is unfair &amp; unethical to make vague general accusations on the “folks I hired.” I’ve brought in a lot of people to Blockstream &amp; generalizing that the “worst parts of Bitcoin culture” come from them is incredibly distasteful. https://t.co/qugvd6xdDZ"

14935,2019-05-29 20:28:20+00:00,Excellion,FYI I blocked Matt back. It’s unfair he can still quote my tweets and continue the conversation while I have to post screenshots to comment. 😂
14936,2019-05-29 09:16:46+00:00,Excellion,@bergealex4 🙅‍♂️
14937,2019-05-29 08:58:11+00:00,Excellion,"15/ Ultimately, not everyone will act how you want or say the things you want to hear. But, if it bothers you a lot, you can block them, and do it without being overly dramatic. 🦁"
14938,2019-05-29 08:57:45+00:00,Excellion,14/ Toxicity is more complex than people that say things you don’t like. It can actually get really toxic to the point where it can affect people’s livelihoods. It’s also a very slippery slope when certain parties try to silence the opinions of others through back channels.
14939,2019-05-29 08:56:52+00:00,Excellion,"13/ Now that's real toxicity &amp; it’s the kind you don’t easily get to see because it’s not on Twitter. Fortunately, I didn’t have to worry about my ‘job’ because I was on the BTCC board of directors, had @Pixelmatic, &amp; am financially stable - but not everyone is in that situation."
14940,2019-05-29 08:56:29+00:00,Excellion,"12/ During the Bitcoin Civil War (XT, Classic, BU) almost every CEO trying to hard-fork Bitcoin was trying to silence me by getting me fired as COO at BTCC. Why? Because I was speaking against them &amp; sticking up for devs like Matt. They'd even email our investors like Lightspeed."
14941,2019-05-29 08:56:05+00:00,Excellion,"11/ It’s a market of ideas vs back room politics, much like #Bitcoin vs fiat. It’s funny how certain types of people that prefer those back room politics are also the ones that complain the loudest about toxicity."
14942,2019-05-29 08:55:26+00:00,Excellion,"10/ There are many different forms of toxicity too. I prefer #BitcoinTwitter open argument than methods like trying to silence people or getting them fired, which is just as toxic if not more. The only difference is in the latter, the perpetrator gets to look good in public."
14943,2019-05-29 08:54:04+00:00,Excellion,9/ “Toxicity” is complicated. Should we be nice to Ver when he uses his Bitcoin account/website to scam people? Should we be nice to companies when they tell us we have no choice but to accept Garzik’s 2x fork? What is considered as toxic by one person may not be from another.
14944,2019-05-29 08:53:38+00:00,Excellion,"8/ Outside of Neil’s commentary, several parallel discussions were spawned from the Soona thread that went into ethnic diversity, gender dynamics, and toxicity in general. I only saw bits and pieces of those, and apparently it got pretty heated."
14945,2019-05-29 08:53:04+00:00,Excellion,"7/ (Ironically, Matt enjoys the luxury to say what he likes at his current employer.) Matt continued to complain &amp; I told him not to bother me on my weekend &amp; that we can talk next week. I guess he didn’t like that because on Monday he started the started the drama. That’s it."
14946,2019-05-29 08:52:35+00:00,Excellion,6/ What am I supposed to keep Neil “in line with” exactly? Some standard set by Matt? Or by some committee that dictates what is a proper opinion? This is all goes against the very ethos of #Bitcoin and principles of self-sovereignty. I don’t even think Matt realizes this.
14947,2019-05-29 08:52:23+00:00,Excellion,5/ Matt messaged me directly to complain about Neil and told me to “keep him in line.” Neil reports to me and heads up our marketing team. I told Matt that I don’t police the thoughts of my team and that they are free to express their own opinions.
14948,2019-05-29 08:51:42+00:00,Excellion,4/ I don’t disagree with anything that @nwoodfine said. Neil is level headed &amp; simply pointing out the realties of the space. I believe his commentary was related to this tweet (https://t.co/inGQkj1vkp) &amp; how we may lose “bright” devs to ETH because Bitcoiners aren’t nice enough.
14949,2019-05-29 08:51:08+00:00,Excellion,"3/ The starting point was this thread from @nwoodfine https://t.co/0YnQFsnWHH. TL;DR: #Bitcoin is very important, attracts scammers and frauds, &amp; a culture has evolved to defend against bad actors / attacks. He went on to say if you can't accept that culture then too bad."
14950,2019-05-29 08:50:45+00:00,Excellion,"2/ By making a massive deal out of blocking me (Matt, you couldn’t just write it, but had to take a screenshot of Twitter UI showing the block - which is literally TEXT in a blue bar), people are wondering if I kicked his dog or worse. Now there’s a CoinDesk article. Geez."
14951,2019-05-29 08:50:10+00:00,Excellion,"1/ The reason people are confused about what's going on and can't find the trail is simply because @TheBlueMatt is being dramatic. I wasn't going respond directly because it's so stupid, but it would be worse to not clarify and invite speculation. 🤦‍♂️ #BitcoinDrama"
