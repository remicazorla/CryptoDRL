4,2023-02-24 13:53:53+00:00,NoelleInMadrid,"@stephanlivera Huge congratulations, Stephan! üë∂‚ù§Ô∏è"
5,2023-02-24 13:49:00+00:00,NoelleInMadrid,"10) The most significant big-picture impact in my opinion, however, is this: **BASE gives us a glimpse of how centralized crypto service providers can become decentralized. In other words, how CeFi can move to DeFi.** This is key. https://t.co/PTrr5pg9tl"
6,2023-02-24 13:48:22+00:00,NoelleInMadrid,"9) Bigger picture, Coinbase has been instrumental in onboarding millions into crypto markets. It has a relatively trusted brand, and could therefore also become a gateway to the on-chain economy for more mainstream users. /15"
7,2023-02-24 13:48:10+00:00,NoelleInMadrid,"Yet rather than disappointing, this is actually hopeful: it highlights the level of scrutiny the launch will be under, as well as the value of getting a sizeable and critical community to test and test and test. /14 https://t.co/qf7aYFINpF"
8,2023-02-24 13:46:15+00:00,NoelleInMadrid,"8) The testnet is live now, and the mainnet is expected to follow within a few months. Initial users yesterday found several glitches, and no doubt there are many yet to be found. /13 https://t.co/GgdNnv3q88"
9,2023-02-24 13:45:37+00:00,NoelleInMadrid,"7) Base will start out relatively centralized, with a centralized sequencer and a handful of validators, but the intention is to move toward a totally decentralized network some time in 2024. /12"
10,2023-02-24 13:45:23+00:00,NoelleInMadrid,"However, BNB has been criticized for its centralization: it has only 26 validators, although last week it announced plans to increase that to 100. Even so, Coinbase is used to a greater degree of public scrutiny. /11  https://t.co/hzIxSFPouu"
11,2023-02-24 13:44:33+00:00,NoelleInMadrid,"6) The initiative is similar to Binance‚Äôs BNB Chain, currently the largest smart contract blockchain in terms of users and transaction volume ‚Äì launched in 2020, it grew so large so fast because of the size of Binance‚Äôs community. /10"
12,2023-02-24 13:44:13+00:00,NoelleInMadrid,"5) There are no plans to issue a token. Whether a token is necessary to incentivize adoption has been the subject of much controversy, and the jury is still out. Base will give the market a chance to observe the build-out of value based on utility rather than reward. /9"
13,2023-02-24 13:43:02+00:00,NoelleInMadrid,"4) Why would external developers work on Base? Coinbase has 110m verified users, acc. to the Q4 earnings report. In other words, a huge community with plenty of upside ‚Äì only a tiny subset of Coinbase users have ever transacted on-chain. /8"
14,2023-02-24 13:42:41+00:00,NoelleInMadrid,3) The chain will offer open-source tools for external developers to create applications for the Coinbase community. These would in theory put a broader range of use cases in front of Coinbase users than if applications were limited to those created by Coinbase teams. /7
15,2023-02-24 13:42:29+00:00,NoelleInMadrid,"It is also a chance for Coinbase to influence how decentralized applications evolve, by contributing code as well as users. Coinbase will become the second official core developer team in the Optimism ecosystem. üßë‚Äçüíª /6"
16,2023-02-24 13:41:50+00:00,NoelleInMadrid,"Plus, creating a new chain ecosystem that forms part of the larger Ethereum ecosystem ‚Äì Base was built using open-source tools from the Optimism stack ‚Äì is a way to more deeply embed Coinbase in the blockchain community. /5"
17,2023-02-24 13:41:32+00:00,NoelleInMadrid,"For instance, imagine extending the existing Coinbase wallet to Base, wrapping tokens from other ecosystems and having some of these unlock NFT functionality while creating new identity systems and supporting the emergence of new communities. /4"
18,2023-02-24 13:41:09+00:00,NoelleInMadrid,"2) Coinbase doesn‚Äôt *need* a blockchain ‚Äì it already is one of the largest crypto platforms in the world. But its own chain sets the base for a new direction of development, perhaps giving birth to new types of transactions, app connections, etc.  /3"
19,2023-02-24 13:40:21+00:00,NoelleInMadrid,"1) This makes Coinbase the first listed company to launch a blockchain. Equity analysts will be scrambling to understand zk-rollups, bridges and more, which should deepen Wall Street interest in and familiarity with the on-chain world. Who knows where that could lead. üïµÔ∏è  /2"
20,2023-02-24 13:39:36+00:00,NoelleInMadrid,"While another layer-2 blockchain may sound like more technical noise wrapped in PR hype, it‚Äôs actually a very big deal, and although I am definitely not a developer or even a frequent DeFi user, I think this is exciting on many fronts. üßµ/1
