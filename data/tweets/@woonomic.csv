5351,2019-07-19 18:55:02+00:00,woonomic,"And a word of warning in alts. Alts very seldom perform long term across full cycles of bull/bear, only a select few historically have achieved this so far (ETH being one). So long term HODL of alts is not a great idea unless you know what you are doing,"
5352,2019-07-19 18:55:01+00:00,woonomic,"Key things to look for is a steady and sustained bull run in BTC with good on-chain volume, this creates a low volatility band in BTCUSD due to buy pressure muting all sell-offs.

5360,2019-07-19 16:54:19+00:00,woonomic,"So what happens when oil, which strengthens USD dominance, is actively being enforced as an energy infrastructure for the world?

It means sustainable energy infrastructure is discouraged. When energy is sustainable and decentralised, it does not strengthen USD trade."

5888,2019-01-27 09:35:55+00:00,woonomic,@crypto_padawan Each contour represents coins grouped by time they've been dormant in wallets. E.g. the red line is the % of coins that are 3mths or less since they last moved.
