is this salsa? almost looks like it could be argentine tango or zouk. I don't do the latin dances as much, but used to compete in wcs. there aren't many of us with a crypto/dance crossover. 😆"
694,2022-11-12 13:37:14+00:00,girlgone_crypto,"@Robenzo25 aww thank you, I appreciate that! 💗"
695,2022-11-12 13:31:01+00:00,girlgone_crypto,@Robenzo25 Probably lol I really do try to help my friends learn/understand more about crypto. Some have been curios and bought some Bitcoin and others haven’t. To each their own as long as they don’t call me lucky 😆
696,2022-11-12 13:27:14+00:00,girlgone_crypto,"Have your friends started texting “I told you so” yet? 

It’s okay, they are the same ones who will call you lucky next bull run."

Why? 

If that company's address list gets leaked (it happened with Ledger), your home will be doxxed as a ""crypto address,"" which could make you a target for thieves."

It's generally best to buy directly from the manufacturer (Ledger, Trezor, etc) instead of a third party site like Amazon or eBay. 

Otherwise, you risk getting a device that has been tampered with."

7560,2020-11-02 18:40:11+00:00,girlgone_crypto,@kobratrading I just mean that when I looked up from reading - I was staring at the screen to the side where I could see myself instead of into the camera itself. lol I think it's awkward to watch videos when people are looking off to the side instead of making eye contact... rookie move.😂 https://t.co/qbCPqie147

9158,2020-08-23 16:00:55+00:00,girlgone_crypto,@torum_official Hello! 👋🏻
9159,2020-08-23 15:55:04+00:00,girlgone_crypto,@TheVladCostea @paparazzi_coin So for example on Hive... the post itself cannot be deleted and is stored the chain - but it can be edited - so only partial pieces of information are actually permanent on chain. Also comments are not built into the chain and can be deleted. So basically-I think it varies a lot.
9160,2020-08-23 15:52:27+00:00,girlgone_crypto,@TheVladCostea @paparazzi_coin I know each platform approaches that a little differently in terms of how much content is actually stored in the blockchain vs. on top of it. I think more are moving towards having a few more centralized components... (i'll finish my thoughts in the comment below)
9161,2020-08-23 15:48:09+00:00,girlgone_crypto,@jaynielea @torum_official Thanks Jaynie! Hope you are doing well! What kind of content is shared on Torum?
9162,2020-08-23 15:46:53+00:00,girlgone_crypto,@dbenshachar @paparazzi_coin @howdooHQ haven't really checked into them much... What kind of content platform is it?
9163,2020-08-23 15:45:58+00:00,girlgone_crypto,@TheVladCostea @paparazzi_coin Because centralized social media sites like Instagram don't really let you own your content. I actually had my instagram disabled for a while and luckily I got it back... but I think in general having more blockchain based social media options is a good thing.
9164,2020-08-23 15:41:28+00:00,girlgone_crypto,"I’m always on the hunt for cool decentralized or alternative social media sites. 🕵️‍♀️

Excited to check out @paparazzi_coin when they launch so I have one more spot to share my photos on the blockchain."

10486,2020-06-22 01:39:29+00:00,girlgone_crypto,@KatieAnanina Maybe I shouldn’t have disclosed my age in this way. 🤣 lmao I was 18/19 in 2008... how I even became a campaign manager at that age is a whole nother story. lol

10510,2020-06-21 14:17:37+00:00,girlgone_crypto,@digiknowassets @cryptohodlr2025 Well another thing to consider is being able to live on the interest earned so you only have to draw down a small percentage of your capital. That might help your numbers.
10511,2020-06-21 14:15:22+00:00,girlgone_crypto,@cryptojelly_ It's absolutely horrible that it isn't. I can't remember having one personal finance class... or even lesson in school.
10512,2020-06-21 14:14:11+00:00,girlgone_crypto,@BitcoinSampo Totally agree. Our school system teaches kids that it's bad to fail - and so it encourages them to not even try.
10513,2020-06-21 14:13:25+00:00,girlgone_crypto,@LuggageDonkey lmao i'll have to get on that Reeding an righting. 🤣
10514,2020-06-21 14:12:40+00:00,girlgone_crypto,@BitcoinRothbard 100%. Imagine what a different world that would be.
10515,2020-06-21 14:11:40+00:00,girlgone_crypto,@OttoGunger That's an interesting point. Kids are so used to being constantly surrounded by technology that giving them some strategies and skills for how to avoid being completely consumed by it would be very helpful.
10516,2020-06-21 14:10:42+00:00,girlgone_crypto,@chabudot lol yes that would extremely helpful.

10522,2020-06-21 14:07:24+00:00,girlgone_crypto,@NoOneDanger Totally agree! There should be more exampls of entrepreneurship and people building things for themselves in the school system.
10523,2020-06-21 14:05:40+00:00,girlgone_crypto,@JamesEgesdal @BitcoinDood lol I can get behind that. I sure would have enjoyed that class a lot more than algebra. 😂
10524,2020-06-21 14:03:15+00:00,girlgone_crypto,@BitcoinDood It’s almost criminal that this stuff isn’t taught. But if people were taught about money and finances - more of them might realize getting into 50-150k of debt for college is a bad idea. And they don’t want that to happen. 😂
10525,2020-06-21 13:59:06+00:00,girlgone_crypto,@CakewalletXMR Lmao this is so true 😂

11514,2020-05-19 03:15:49+00:00,girlgone_crypto,"What's the first step to people being able to spend their crypto out in the wild? Brands and merchants that accept it.

If ya'll need new shades - you can pick up a pair of @YunizonEyewear with $BTC, $BCH, $LTC, or $ETH. 😎

11524,2020-05-18 12:53:46+00:00,girlgone_crypto,@JoseMuo29490424 Yep 💯
11525,2020-05-18 12:52:51+00:00,girlgone_crypto,@mattleising So you are defending the US Federal Reserve printing trillions of dollars right now? 🤔
11526,2020-05-18 12:50:40+00:00,girlgone_crypto,@UncleTinAZ Ahh the good old days of the gold standard.
11527,2020-05-18 12:49:29+00:00,girlgone_crypto,@triplemyripple Exactly - that’s what many Americans don’t realize yet.
11528,2020-05-18 04:34:09+00:00,girlgone_crypto,"Why do so many Americans accept this line of reasoning without thinking- “If they can just create money out of thin air” then why do we...

👉🏻 Pay taxes
👉🏻 Work at jobs we hate 
👉🏻 Or... even have bills at all

Why not just print enough for everyone to retire on a beach? 🏝🤦🏼‍♀️"
11529,2020-05-18 02:08:18+00:00,girlgone_crypto,@adryenn Yeah it’s absolutely ridiculous. We’ll see if he ends up having to withdraw the statement when push comes to shove. I honestly don’t think this would stand up in a court of law.

Also - I think the deadline already passed 😬"
11539,2020-05-17 18:02:21+00:00,girlgone_crypto,@RobertHarju Agreed. Sadly people are willing to go along with all sorts of things when they are scared.
11540,2020-05-17 17:55:24+00:00,girlgone_crypto,"@RobertHarju I sure hope so. I know a lot of my friends around here have no problem with tracing, but I DO hope that as an American they would have a problem with telling someone they can’t leave their home."
11541,2020-05-17 17:54:19+00:00,girlgone_crypto,@EnjarGames I actually thought the same thing and wondered how this would stand up in court. They haven’t fully implemented their tracing/testing plan yet - they are just working on it. Will be interesting to see how this plays out.

11549,2020-05-17 17:25:02+00:00,girlgone_crypto,@GLtchodler Yeah totally ridiculous. We’ll see if he gets enough backlash to retract it. I hope so. He’s retracted a few crazy things he’s already said.
11550,2020-05-17 17:24:08+00:00,girlgone_crypto,@Arizonajosh2 Haha no I missed that. I’ll have to go check it out.

11770,2020-05-14 00:14:26+00:00,girlgone_crypto,@mattunchi @TheRealBlockFi I didn't have to KYC. The most sensitive information they asked for was a SSN.
11771,2020-05-13 21:12:46+00:00,girlgone_crypto,@nthonyBurtila Yeeess! I knew I liked you! 😂
11772,2020-05-13 20:23:31+00:00,girlgone_crypto,@AwyeeDeaterBob @BitcoinRothbard @TheRealBlockFi So what is your point exactly? That someone making a high-quality tutorial video about something is a bad thing?
11773,2020-05-13 20:22:37+00:00,girlgone_crypto,@PetMM2 @TheRealBlockFi @CelsiusNetwork I'm not sure if they are available in my state yet - but i'm definitely interested in checking them out when they are.
11774,2020-05-13 19:26:21+00:00,girlgone_crypto,@cryptygirl Thanks girl! 💞
11775,2020-05-13 19:22:55+00:00,girlgone_crypto,@GibsoonCorp @TheRealBlockFi That's a good question. I would assume so - the fine print didn't say anything about stipulations on the $100 once you have it. I mean I'm sure they hope people keep it in there - but from what I hear it takes about 24 hours to withdraw funds.
11776,2020-05-13 19:20:40+00:00,girlgone_crypto,"@AwyeeDeaterBob @BitcoinRothbard @TheRealBlockFi lol because a shill refers to someone who is getting paid to talk about something... or to ""shill"" something. 😂"
11777,2020-05-13 19:17:12+00:00,girlgone_crypto,@AwyeeDeaterBob @BitcoinRothbard @TheRealBlockFi This is not a paid video in anyway. I literally didn’t even add my referral link. Just thought this was cool and that some people might find a video tutorial helpful.
11778,2020-05-13 18:51:05+00:00,girlgone_crypto,@cryptosandicos @WAX_io @Topps @crypt0snews So you think I'm old? 😭 haha jk... I've heard of them but I do think they were a little before my time.
11779,2020-05-13 18:50:10+00:00,girlgone_crypto,@BlockchainDias @TheRealBlockFi yeah agreed. I like that they are backed by Winklevoss and Coinbase.
11780,2020-05-13 18:49:36+00:00,girlgone_crypto,@homelessmoses @undergroundcomp @TheRealBlockFi Thank for the extra info! Good to hear from someone who has been using it.
11781,2020-05-13 18:46:13+00:00,girlgone_crypto,@PsychedelicBart @CoinRul @TheRealBlockFi Just honestly thought this was cool and decided to put together a video that I thought people might find helpful. It would have been easier to write up a quick tweet - but I decided to spend the morning making this video because that's the kind of quality I bring to my channel.
11782,2020-05-13 18:40:33+00:00,girlgone_crypto,@undergroundcomp @TheRealBlockFi Love Trezor! Yeah I would definitely want to keep most of my bitcoin in a hardware wallet - but I'm thinking about putting a small percentage into an account like this to earn a little interest. We'll see. This is my first experience with them so far.
11783,2020-05-13 18:38:07+00:00,girlgone_crypto,@zndtoshi @TheRealBlockFi 100%. If I ever made a full video talking about all the pro's and con's of using interest accounts for bitcoin - that would definitely be a big part of the conversation.

It took a lot more effort than just writing a quick tweet - but that's the kind of quality and attention I bring to my content.
11787,2020-05-13 18:28:53+00:00,girlgone_crypto,@PsychedelicBart @CoinRul @TheRealBlockFi This is not a paid video.

12421,2020-04-22 14:31:17+00:00,girlgone_crypto,"@CryptoAdam4 It's the extra $600/week stimulus that has pushed people over their regular wages. I just say this is inefficient of government because it's not necessary. If someone was living on $1,000 a week before this - they don't really need $1,200 a week to pay those same bills. /2"
12422,2020-04-22 14:28:45+00:00,girlgone_crypto,"@CryptoAdam4 Well, regular unemployment is about 60% of wages - which I think is pretty reasonable. It's enough that someone hopefully can tighten their budget and get by for a while, but it also incentivizes them to go out and find work as soon as possible. /1"
12423,2020-04-22 14:25:46+00:00,girlgone_crypto,@mjeng54 It’s really due to the extra $600 a week for anyone on unemployment right now that was part of the stimulus.

13195,2020-03-27 20:22:18+00:00,girlgone_crypto,What is something positive that has happened in your life this last week?
13196,2020-03-27 16:09:37+00:00,girlgone_crypto,@RedKatLife Exactly. I don't think we'll ever know the true numbers because many people have been unable to get tests around the world and there are reports that China stopped counting their numbers. That being said... to be this early in the process and already have so many cases is scary.
13197,2020-03-27 16:05:25+00:00,girlgone_crypto,@SatoshiProof @lifeisGewd96 That's a good point. People are usually the worst judge of how serious their own symptoms are because when they are freaked out - everything can get blown out of proportion. That being said - with more doctors learning how to use telemedicine - I think access will improve.
13198,2020-03-27 16:03:06+00:00,girlgone_crypto,@Veldpark Probably not. I just thought it was interesting/maybe even scary to point out that we are a few weeks behind some of these other countries in terms of stages of spreading and we already have so many cases.
13199,2020-03-27 15:52:55+00:00,girlgone_crypto,@CRYPTOKEN_board It’s such a struggle 😂 I am way too long-winded for Twitter!
13200,2020-03-27 15:49:16+00:00,girlgone_crypto,@SatoshiProof @lifeisGewd96 I personally know about 15 people that have wanted to get tests and have been turned away here in Seattle.
13201,2020-03-27 15:48:20+00:00,girlgone_crypto,@CRYPTOKEN_board I ran out of characters in my tweet to include ALL of the terrible things we leave the world in. 😅

15150,2019-12-17 01:06:24+00:00,girlgone_crypto,@AnselLindner @mcpauld No one’s talking about not calling out scammers. Those guys should get called out. I think Paul is referring more generally to the tribalism between projects.

15159,2019-12-16 16:36:14+00:00,girlgone_crypto,@theonevortex @mcpauld I don’t think Paul is referring to crypto fighting the old money systems - but people within the crypto community taking joy when other coins/projects fail.

15193,2019-12-12 14:40:34+00:00,girlgone_crypto,"@girls_bitcoin Haha yup. I’ve had that happen before too! It’s amazing how a few days can throw off the whole routine. That happens for me and food too! I’ll be really good about eating healthy, then have a few bad days and it all starts going downhill from there!"
15194,2019-12-12 14:28:44+00:00,girlgone_crypto,@steemir I wish. :) It's at a local coffee shop actually!

15201,2019-12-12 14:25:25+00:00,girlgone_crypto,@SeanSupplee Love that!! That's exactly what I try to do too. Just get the important stuff out of the way so I can decide what I want to do from there without stuff hanging over my shoulders all day.
15202,2019-12-12 14:24:37+00:00,girlgone_crypto,@PayneFullHuman I think i've always been a morning person... which helps. But yeah a lot of people rag on mornings! I love getting up and getting a ton of stuff done first thing and then still having a lot of my day left.

15212,2019-12-12 14:15:04+00:00,girlgone_crypto,@CHeemskerk89 I imagine they'd likely use something that isn't very decentralized to jump on the trend - but will still be something that allows them to keep all the power they currently do.

15477,2019-11-12 17:55:44+00:00,girlgone_crypto,@spence2140 That’s fair. Many other coins have an element of centralization.
15478,2019-11-12 17:55:06+00:00,girlgone_crypto,@BigPic29 @lisamightydavis Because bitcoin is a deflationary currency. Quantitive easing may devalue the dollar - but you can’t do that with bitcoin because it has a fixed supply.
15479,2019-11-12 17:53:18+00:00,girlgone_crypto,@snh072347 @erinnakamoto If you securely store your crypto assets - you don’t have to worry about getting hacked. If you get hacked - it’s because you fell for a phishing scam or something of that nature and gave your private keys away.
