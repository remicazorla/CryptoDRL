338,2021-10-12 18:41:15+00:00,SatoshiLite,"Since then, we have launched @LTCPayCom, a self-hosted merchant processing service. We also partnered with @UnbankedHQ to launch the Litecoin Card, which is a Visa card backed by LTC. You can sign up for the card here: https://t.co/vUTndfwktO

We fulfilled LitePay's promises."
339,2021-10-12 18:36:50+00:00,SatoshiLite,"LitePay received $100k in investment from the foundation and another investor and failed to deliver. The community was extremely disappointed and it was a black eye for the foundation.

But this got us to work harder to deliver on these failed promises."
340,2021-10-12 18:34:38+00:00,SatoshiLite,"People were very excited about LitePay and the Litecoin Foundation even invested $50k in the startup.

At the end though, LitePay turned out to be a dud. It didn't launch and the company shut down. It was likely a failed startup, although I'm not 100% sure if it wasn't a scam."
341,2021-10-12 18:32:15+00:00,SatoshiLite,"In early 2018, a company named LitePay came on the scene. They promised to be the BitPay of Litecoin. Will provide merchant services for merchants accepting Litecoin and have a LTC debit card for consumers to spend LTC everywhere. This was huge news for Litecoin."
342,2021-10-12 18:27:11+00:00,SatoshiLite,"Being the creator of Litecoin, I would want Litecoin to succeed even if I didn't hold any LTC. I think I have proven that to be true over the past 4 years. So I'm focused on the success and adoption of Litecoin and not on the price of LTC. I believe that's the best for Litecoin."
343,2021-10-12 18:23:26+00:00,SatoshiLite,"When I sold my LTC, what I wanted to accomplish was 3 things:
1) Remove the fear of a Satoshi stash
2) Make Litecoin more decentralized
3) Align my motivation/incentive to Litecoin adoption versus LTC price rise"
344,2021-10-12 18:20:32+00:00,SatoshiLite,"Pretty much every other altcoin had a huge premine. Even Ethereum had like 70% coins premined. There's nothing wrong with a premine, except I think there are different fiduciary duties when you created a coin with a big premine for yourself."
345,2021-10-12 18:17:31+00:00,SatoshiLite,"First of all, due to the fair mining I described in detail at the beginning, I didn't have a ton of LTC to begin with. I bought and mined all my LTC just like any other Litecoin supporter. I had more than most because I got in early but I knew of many people with a lot more."
346,2021-10-12 18:15:12+00:00,SatoshiLite,"As you all know, I infamously sold all my LTC at the end of 2017. Since this is more a thread about Litecoin than a thread about me, I won't spend too much time talking about it, but I do want to address it."
347,2021-10-12 17:57:39+00:00,SatoshiLite,"@ProofofBrain_ @brian_armstrong I‚Äôm focused on adoption and can‚Äôt control price. But I do think people should treat LTC as money instead of an investment. It was very volatile in 2017 and price wasn‚Äôt higher than $170 for many days in 2017. So in terms of purchasing power, LTC is doing ok."
348,2021-10-12 17:39:08+00:00,SatoshiLite,"It definitely felt good to be proven correct!

This ends my rant on Coinbase. And I guess you can blame me for turning Coinbase into a shitcoin casino that it is today. üòÇ

More later..."
349,2021-10-12 17:38:15+00:00,SatoshiLite,Litecoin trading volume shot through the roof as expected on both GDAX and Coinbase. I believe Litecoin made Coinbase over $100m in revenue in 2017. Brain even emailed to apologize for what I had to go through. He agreed that adding Litecoin was super lucrative for Coinbase.
350,2021-10-12 17:28:39+00:00,SatoshiLite,"I didn't want him to change his mind. Face with tears of joy

I took it as his approval and just got the team together to make it happen. Litecoin launched on Coinbase in May.

And June 9 was my last day, but that was planned 6+ months in advance.

https://t.co/dPrinHZE3O"
351,2021-10-12 17:22:36+00:00,SatoshiLite,"This was definitely not a staged tweet and reply. I actually didn't expect Brian to reply at all, but I was extremely glad to see him agree with me.

So right away, I gathered the team together at Coinbase to launch Litecoin. I didn't even talk to Brian after his Twitter reply."
352,2021-10-12 17:20:43+00:00,SatoshiLite,"I had pretty much given up ever seeing LTC launched on Coinbase, the main site. That is until I made a last ditch attempt in April. At that time due to SegWit signaling, GDAX was seeing huge volumes of trading. So I made a sort of a passive aggressive tweet at Brian. https://t.co/mKGoJmpsYs"
353,2021-10-12 17:17:54+00:00,SatoshiLite,I decided then that I would leave Coinbase to focus on Litecoin. I told Brian I was going to resign and transition everything by early 2017. But they asked me to say a bit longer to make sure there was enough time to transition everything.
354,2021-10-12 17:15:25+00:00,SatoshiLite,I believed launching LTC would be a good move for Coinbase financially because there was a ton of unmet demand for LTC trading in the US. And I was frustrated that Brian and Fred did not see that and they were just doing it to please me I guess. That just didn't feel right.
355,2021-10-12 17:12:45+00:00,SatoshiLite,"It would have been easy to launch on both GDAX and Coinbase. Actually, it would have been easier since we already have a successful launch plan to follow. Coinbase basically had to go out of the way to cripple the Litecoin launch and not even hold any LTC to pay for miner fees."
356,2021-10-12 17:09:49+00:00,SatoshiLite,This was the state of crypto trading a month before launch. It wasn't like Litecoin was a small coin. It was the #5 coin with trading volume that almost matched Etheruem's and LTC wasn't even on Coinbase. So I was extremely frustrated and felt a bit slighted. https://t.co/kGPgXDzyyt
357,2021-10-12 17:07:28+00:00,SatoshiLite,"But without holding some LTC, we cannot launch on Coinbase and I knew this would seriously hurt the launch. We didn't even have any LTC to pay miner fees. I had to personally lend Coinbase my own LTC! I was really disappointed that we did this launch as an afterthought."
358,2021-10-12 17:05:29+00:00,SatoshiLite,"We did not follow the Ethereum launch, which I helped design, that was extremely successful. So the LTC launched on GDAX was a huge failure IMO. Fred had refused to let Coinbase hold any LTC and due to conflict of interest, I didn't feel it was right for me to argue with him."
359,2021-10-12 17:04:10+00:00,SatoshiLite,"Coinbase did not put any resources behind this launch and pretty much just quietly launched the LTC/BTC and LTC/USD trading pairs with an empty order book. For reasons unknown to me, Brian &amp; Fred refused to do a full launch on GDAX &amp; Coinbase like we did with ETH."
360,2021-10-12 17:02:43+00:00,SatoshiLite,"After taking the summer off in 2016 to work on Litecoin SegWit, I went part time at Coinbase and worked mostly from home. At that time I asked Brian if we can add LTC support given how successful the Ethereum launch was. Brian reluctantly agreed to launch on GDAX only."
361,2021-10-08 19:58:14+00:00,SatoshiLite,"Oh, forgot to mention, there was also the first cross-chain atomic swap between Litecoin and Bitcoin with John Stefanopoulos (@JStefanop1).

After the agreement, signaling jumped to like 90%. It really showed how centralized mining was at the time."
370,2021-10-08 19:15:43+00:00,SatoshiLite,"Although this seems so bad for a decentralized cryptocurrency to have a closed door meeting to make decisions that affect the future of Litecoin, I felt like it was a compromise I'm willing to take. It's better than an all out war between the miners and I."
371,2021-10-08 19:13:38+00:00,SatoshiLite,"On April 21, I met with Jihan, Innosilicon, and miners for over 8 hours IIRC. It was exhausting. We ironed out our differences and came to an agreement.

https://t.co/IUckBZCKKC"
372,2021-10-08 19:11:31+00:00,SatoshiLite,"And when SegWit activates, miners will have to comply and mine the chain with SegWit, because the chain without SegWit would be worthless. That's the idea of UASF.

This really scared the miners. UASF basically kneecaps them. And this is what happened.

https://t.co/kwj81v3PNC"
373,2021-10-08 19:08:37+00:00,SatoshiLite,"@Excellion UASF stands for User Activated Soft Fork. What it means is that instead of having the soft fork (SegWit) being miner activated, the user decides to activate the soft fork in a future date. If the majority of users and exchanges run the UASF code, SegWit will activate."
374,2021-10-08 19:07:00+00:00,SatoshiLite,"They shouldn't have the power to block an upgrade like this. And that's why I decided to pull the UASF trump card out. I wore the UASF hat made by @Excellion and tweeted this out on April 11th.

https://t.co/s3ke9PbqXK"
375,2021-10-08 19:05:15+00:00,SatoshiLite,"All this was just wrong. Users wanted SegWit. Markets wanted it. Why are miners, basically 1 person, able to block something that is good for Litecoin and Bitcoin.

In the end, miners are being paid to do one thing, which is to collect transactions into blocks and broadcast them."
376,2021-10-08 19:03:13+00:00,SatoshiLite,"Over the next week, more and more miners started signaling for SegWit and it started to look inevitable. And then this happened. Bitmain was building a ton of LTC miners and was going to turn them all on themselves to block the upgrade. üò°

https://t.co/Zvs9srExJJ"
377,2021-10-08 19:01:47+00:00,SatoshiLite,But of course more drama ensues. Jihan wanted me to personally visit him and the miners in China to convince them about SegWit. I didn't feel like that was necessary. I wanted them to chat with me via video chat but they refused. It was a power play move and I didn't like it.
378,2021-10-08 18:59:09+00:00,SatoshiLite,"On April 1st, F2pool finally signaled SegWit for good this time. And of course the LTC price popped right afterwards. It was really hard for miners to deny that SegWit is good for Litecoin... at least for their pocketbooks.

379,2021-10-08 18:56:53+00:00,SatoshiLite,"On 2/14/21, with the help of the large miner, we were at 20% signaling. This was a long way from the 75% needed in order to activate SegWit.

https://t.co/5rKPhytnwj"
380,2021-10-08 18:55:33+00:00,SatoshiLite,"So over the next month, F2pool actually flipped flopped. They would signal and then stop signaling. The market reacted accordingly. When F2pool started signaling, the price will go up, and vice versa.

It became clear as day that the market wants Litecoin to get SegWit!"
381,2021-10-08 18:53:48+00:00,SatoshiLite,"I chatted with Chun a lot during that time period. He basically told me that because he's a pool and not a miner, he's not afraid of Jihan as Jihan has no power over him. But he's still concerned that he might lose hashrate if his signaled as miners might be convinced to leave."
382,2021-10-08 18:51:24+00:00,SatoshiLite,"LitecoinPool (@ltcpool) was the first pool to support SegWit. They did a vote among the miners in the pool and IIRC, it was overwhelmingly in favor of SegWit.

F2pool promised to support it but they didn't signal right away. Wang Chun (@satofishi) is the founder of F2pool."
383,2021-10-08 18:48:03+00:00,SatoshiLite,"In February 2011, SegWit signaling started on Litecoin. Basically miners will signal whether or not they supported SegWit in the blocks they mined. If 75% of blocks signal for SegWit within a 2-week timeframe, it will lock and SegWit will activate after some time."
384,2021-10-08 18:46:55+00:00,SatoshiLite,"The problem was that this miner had his ASICs with a mining farm controlled by Jihan. He was able to get cheap electricity and was afraid that if he signaled for SegWit, he might get cut off from this cheap electricity. Lots of drama, but in the end, he signaled for SegWit."
385,2021-10-08 18:43:43+00:00,SatoshiLite,"Innosilicon was immediately on board with SegWit. They agreed with me that it's the best path forward. And they were able to convince some of their customers to support SegWit.

One of their customers was a huge LTC miner. He owned about 5% of the hashrate. Having him was huge."
386,2021-10-08 18:41:02+00:00,SatoshiLite,"A democracy is much less efficient but it's best for the long run as a benevolent dictator can easily turn bad.

Anyways, this was what I set out to do. I met and talked to many miners throughout the end of 2016 to early 2017. I talked to Innosilicon, another LTC ASIC maker."
387,2021-10-08 18:38:45+00:00,SatoshiLite,This makes it much harder for miners to block SegWit on Litecoin because they think that's best for Litecoin when I'm publicly saying the opposite. This is why a bit of centralization is more efficient. It's like the difference between a benevolent dictator and a democracy.
388,2021-10-08 18:37:07+00:00,SatoshiLite,"The difference between Bitcoin and Litecoin is me. Bitcoin is more decentralized. There's no one to come out to speak on what their vision of Bitcoin is. But for Litecoin, I can come out and tell the world my vision for Litecoin, which I have done."
389,2021-10-08 18:35:27+00:00,SatoshiLite,"Unfortunately that became very contentious. Because Jihan had a lot of influence, he single-handedly was able to block SegWit activation on Bitcoin. And because Bitmain also made one of the most efficient Litecoin miners, he had a lot of influence on Litecoin miners also."
390,2021-10-08 18:33:22+00:00,SatoshiLite,Most of the developers of Bitcoin believe that scaling onchain reduces decentralization of Bitcoin as it makes it much harder for people to run a node if it's too resource intensive. This is what I believe in also and why we think SegWit was the best solution.
391,2021-10-08 18:31:57+00:00,SatoshiLite,"The co-founder of Bitamin, Jihan Wu (@JihanWu), is a big supporter of scaling Bitcoin onchain. Basically, he belives Bitcoin can just hard fork to increase the block size and there's no reason why we need to do something complicated like SegWit and LN."
392,2021-10-08 18:29:32+00:00,SatoshiLite,"The problem is that mining at the time was quite centralized. It basically revolved around one big player: Bitmain. Because Bitmain controlled the most efficient ASIC, they had a lot of sway over the miners. If miners don't cooperate, Bitmain may withhold future ASICs."
393,2021-10-08 18:24:50+00:00,SatoshiLite,"Solving transaction malleability allows for the Lightning Network to function.

So SegWit fixes a major issue, increase block size by 2x, and allows for LN to scale Bitcoin/Litecoin even more. It's a win/win/win. When I first heard of it, I was really excited about it activating!"
394,2021-10-08 18:22:11+00:00,SatoshiLite,"SegWit treats the witness portion different than the rest with respect to block size. So it's effectively a 2 times increase in block size. SegWit also fixes a transaction malleability issue, which affected MtGox because MtGox didn't track transactions well when the hash changed."
395,2021-10-08 18:19:27+00:00,SatoshiLite,"For those of you new to crypto (probably 90% of you), you might not have heard of SegWit. Here's more on SegWit: https://t.co/1d2yLkhGYI

SegWit stands for Segregated Witness. It's basically an upgrade that would separate out the signature (i.e. witness) from the transaction."

401,2021-10-08 00:36:17+00:00,SatoshiLite,"Testnet can test out the technical function of the blockchain but it can't test out the game theory of the blockchain. That's because there's no real value in testnet coins, so there's no reason for attackers to attack the chain if they can't profit from it. Litecoin changes that"
402,2021-10-08 00:35:16+00:00,SatoshiLite,"Basically the fear was that once SegWit is activated, miners can steal any coins sent to SegWit addresses. Anyone technical enough knows that this was not true. It was not possible for miners to steal coins that way. Unfortunately Bitcoin testnet was not useful here."
403,2021-10-08 00:33:57+00:00,SatoshiLite,"I realized that here's a chance for Litecoin to do something to help Bitcoin. If we can get SegWit on Litecoin, it can clear out all the FUD and prove that SegWit is safe and a good upgrade for Bitcoin.

Back then the biggest FUD was the anyone-can-spend FUD."
404,2021-10-08 00:32:23+00:00,SatoshiLite,"But for some reason, it was being blocked by miners. Now in hindsight, we know why that was the case. But at that time, there was so much FUD around SegWit that it seemed hopeless that it will ever be adopted by Bitcoin. SegWit was need for Lightning Networks to function well."
405,2021-10-08 00:30:32+00:00,SatoshiLite,"This was one of the reasons why I decided to take 3 months off from Coinbase in 2016 to focus my efforts back to Litecoin.

At the time SegWit was being pushed for Bitcoin and it was running into a lot of roadblocks. It was technically sound and a great upgrade for Bitcoin."
406,2021-10-08 00:28:34+00:00,SatoshiLite,"Although I went along with the plan, it kind of rubbed me the wrong way. Litecoin had a much higher global trade volume at the time and was the #2 coin in marketcap. So although it's fair that Ethereum had more potential, we went out of our way to not launch LTC at the same time."
407,2021-10-08 00:25:06+00:00,SatoshiLite,"There was a lot of unsatisfied demand. People in the US had no easy way to store and trade these coins. And Coinbase would steal a lion share of the demand if we added the 2 coins to start.

Both Brian and Fred like the idea but they crossed out LTC. They just want to do ETH."
408,2021-10-08 00:22:56+00:00,SatoshiLite,This was also when Ethereum was starting to get big. So I put together a proposal to Brian and Fred Ehrsam (@FEhrsam) to add both LTC and ETH to Coinbase. Basically the reasoning was that it was clear that Coinbase could make a lot of money if it let people trade ETH and LTC.
409,2021-10-08 00:21:29+00:00,SatoshiLite,That changed though in 2016. The was when Litecoin trade volume exploded on Chinese exchanges and it was clear to me that Coinbase was leaving a lot of money on the table by not supporting altcoins. And it made business sense for Coinbase to add altcoins.

I pretty much talked to all the exchanges to support LTC. I realized that liquidity is super important for a coin. Without liquidity, you can't do anything."
427,2021-10-07 19:56:31+00:00,SatoshiLite,"Soon after the launch, Litecoin was added to BTC-e. That helped a lot as miners had access to liquidity pretty quickly.

432,2021-10-07 17:51:23+00:00,SatoshiLite,"I think I managed to pull off the fairest launch of any coin. And that is one of the biggest reasons why Litecoin succeeded. Surprisingly, very very few coins copied Litecoin's launch.

Ok, that's it for now. I will tweet more later about what happened between launch and now."
433,2021-10-07 17:48:09+00:00,SatoshiLite,"There was quite a bit of chain orphaning as the difficulty was set a bit low. There was no way for me to predict how successful the launch was going to be.

I myself only managed to get a handful of blocks. People for the most part were very happy with how the launch went."
434,2021-10-07 17:46:25+00:00,SatoshiLite,"At launch, I posted the config paramters that were needed to mine on mainnet. All everyone had to do was paste that into their litecoin config file, restart their client, and they will be happily mining real LTC.

Of course, there was a mad rush of people mining LTC at the start. https://t.co/ZyUcQ1UEe3"
435,2021-10-07 17:40:51+00:00,SatoshiLite,"I did everything I could think of to make this as fair as possible. As you can see, the winning time was not what I voted on. It actually was a very inconvenient time for me! But crowd (albeit very small) has spoken.

So I prepared everything for to launch at that time."
436,2021-10-07 17:39:20+00:00,SatoshiLite,"Without those 2 parameters, one cannot start mining on the mainnet, but they can easily mine on testnet.

So I lied, there was a 2 block premine of 100 coins. üòÇ
The genesis coins cannot be spent.

Then I did a poll on what time we should launch the coin:
https://t.co/BWvGGFjNBN https://t.co/AuXkqMB4QT"
437,2021-10-07 17:36:57+00:00,SatoshiLite,"At launch, if they release that long chain, it will become the longest chain and they would win all those early blocks. So what I did was to lock in a block after the genesis block. I mined block 2 and 3 and hard coded those hashes in the code but I withheld a couple parameters."
438,2021-10-07 17:35:16+00:00,SatoshiLite,"That way everyone can be prepared to mine at launch. So the launch would be fair.

To accomplish this, I of course had to share the genesis block with everyone. But I can't just do that because people can mine a long chain in private from that genesis block."
439,2021-10-07 17:32:38+00:00,SatoshiLite,"Here's the launch thread: https://t.co/rfwNF1gmSd

Binaries were also available for those that trusted me and didn't know how to compile the code for themselves. People were able to immediately mine on testnet to make sure everything works on their system. This is very important."
440,2021-10-07 17:31:16+00:00,SatoshiLite,"On 10/8/11, I announced Litecoin to https://t.co/35WbpkrwD9. BitcoinTalk is basically the only place that people chatted about Bitcoin. No one used reddit, Twitter, Facebook.

The code was available for anyone to download and compile. So they can check the code to make sure. https://t.co/JJbF1QhhHL"
441,2021-10-07 17:28:47+00:00,SatoshiLite,"So I had to do some reverse engineering and managed to  create the genesis block on 10/7/11
https://t.co/lArbbucLGU

What a lot of people didn't know is that I put the headline of Steve Job's death in the genesis hash. This proves that the genesis block was created after 10/5/11. https://t.co/Zn7tnRBgUM"
442,2021-10-07 17:25:30+00:00,SatoshiLite,"I worked on the code for a few days. To be honest, Litecoin was not hard to code up. The hardest part was actually to create the genesis block. Satoshi never documented how he did it and the code to do that was not checked in with the Bitcoin source code."
443,2021-10-07 17:23:00+00:00,SatoshiLite,"The best part was that all the domains were available. So on 10/4/11, I bought them all on GoDaddy. What a great move in hindsight.

444,2021-10-07 17:19:54+00:00,SatoshiLite,"I basically took everything that's good from these altcoins (speed, CPU mining) and did a fair launch. And that's why Litecoin succeeded where others failed.

The name Litecoin came to me pretty quickly. I thought of something like an Elitecoin first. Then Litecoin jumped out."
445,2021-10-07 17:17:43+00:00,SatoshiLite,"And it might be released without the source code or with only Windows binary. That way, a small number of users get to profit early on.

This was the landscape of altcoins before Litecoin. So what I tried to do with Litecoin was to change all of that. Fairness was crucial."
446,2021-10-07 17:15:44+00:00,SatoshiLite,"Since the coins were just printed out of thin air, it's cheap to collude with exchanges to pump the coin. We've seen that happen with ICOs in 2017.

If a coin was not premined, you get things like ninja mining. That's when a coin is released silently to friends and family."
447,2021-10-07 17:13:46+00:00,SatoshiLite,Most of these altcoins have a huge premine. Tenebrix for example had 7 million coins premined. That means the the creator has incentives to pump the coin to a high price so he/she can profit massively without much work. You get things like creators bribing exchanges for listing.
448,2021-10-07 17:11:08+00:00,SatoshiLite,"And it's important for anyone to be able to easily mine the coin. If your miner base is large, your user base is large. And those are the users that will actively push for adoption and help make the coin succeed.

The problem though with these altcoins was fairness."
449,2021-10-07 17:09:19+00:00,SatoshiLite,These altcoins experimented on different things like faster block times and different mining algorithm. Bitcoin at the time was predominantly mined by GPUs. Tenebrix brought back CPU mining with Scrypt. This is actually very important because miners are the coin's first users.
450,2021-10-07 17:07:23+00:00,SatoshiLite,"The first altcoin to Bitcoin is actually Namecoin. It used the same mining algorithm as Bitcoin, sha256d. After Namecoin came about a dozen other altcoins: Ixcoin, Iocoin, Solidcoin, Tenebrix, etc. This was all before Litecoin was launched. Every one of these coins are now dead."
451,2021-10-07 17:03:33+00:00,SatoshiLite,"As we are approaching the 10th anniversary of Litecoin, I figured it's a good time to do a long Twitter üßµ on the history of Litecoin from my perspective.

It's funny because it's true. What's the value of an NFT of a song when everyone in the world can own the actual song for $1? https://t.co/jKFY7mxbH6"
522,2021-03-04 20:18:23+00:00,SatoshiLite,"10/ This is different from traditional baseball cards. The manufacturer or even the league can cease to exist, but the physical card can still retain value.

525,2021-03-04 20:18:22+00:00,SatoshiLite,7/ The majority of the value of owning a collectible is lost by switching the ownership from the actual collectible to its certificate of authenticity.

526,2021-03-04 20:18:22+00:00,SatoshiLite,6/ Part of the value of owning a collectible is the prestige to be able to say only I own it and can display the collectible. And no one else in the world can do that. NFT reduces that value to only I own and can display the certificate of authenticity.
527,2021-03-04 20:18:22+00:00,SatoshiLite,"5/ It‚Äôs definitely worth something. But is the full value of the Mona Lisa transferred to this certificate? I argue definitely not.

529,2021-03-04 20:18:21+00:00,SatoshiLite,"3/ Then we can duplicate, for example, the Mona Lisa. And every person can hang a perfect replica of the Mona Lisa on a wall at home. That reduces the value of the original Mona Lisa because no one can prove that it‚Äôs the original."

561,2021-02-14 10:27:04+00:00,SatoshiLite,"19/ I hope that clears things up. Merged mining doesn't add any new security threat. If anything, it helps both coins to combine their security budget.

Merged mining has been great for both Litecoin and Dogecoin. And I'm happy to see Dogecoin doing well recently. https://t.co/acmBCvqOMG"
562,2021-02-14 10:27:02+00:00,SatoshiLite,"18/ If you can pull off this attack, you can make money by depositing LTC to an exchange and double spending it. Adding the ability to also double spend DOGE at the same time adds nothing. Re-read the original hypothetical attack and remove the DOGE from it. It's the same attack. https://t.co/LJtUqklysc"
563,2021-02-14 10:27:01+00:00,SatoshiLite,"17/ The only difference with merged mining is that if you have the resources to 51% attack Litecoin, you can also 51% attack Dogecoin at the same time. But what good does that do?

It's not more attractive to attack Litecoin. There's no higher ROI to attack Litecoin and Dogecoin. https://t.co/Vy7JCktXHv"
564,2021-02-14 10:27:01+00:00,SatoshiLite,"16/ The incremental costs are actually more! Pools like LitecoinPool are paying out PPS 155%. This means miners are getting 55% more in mining rewards than before because of the extra DOGE they get with merged mining.

So incremental costs are $23,250 instead of $15,000."

566,2021-02-14 10:27:00+00:00,SatoshiLite,"14/ So how does the recent increase in Dogecoin marketcap and liquidity affect this 51% attack scenario?

The simple answer is that it doesn't at all. It still costs $100M+ to acquire the hashrate needed to do the 51% attack. That's still prohibitively expensive."
567,2021-02-14 10:26:59+00:00,SatoshiLite,13/ Litecoin is Scrypt-dominant and that is one of the reasons why Dogecoin switched to merged mining (AuxPoW) with Litecoin in 2014. Litecoin and Dogecoin miners are combining forces to mine both coins at the same time. So it would cost almost just as much to attack Dogecoin.
568,2021-02-14 10:26:59+00:00,SatoshiLite,"12/ Whereas, Bitcoin Cash (33% NH-able) and BitcoinSV (40% NH-able) are much much easier to 51% attack. If you can rent the hashrate, then there's no upfront costs and only the incremental costs are needed. That's why it's important for a POW coin to be mining algorithm dominant. https://t.co/8azgCCInGM"
569,2021-02-14 10:26:59+00:00,SatoshiLite,11/ There's also another way to get the hashrate needed to attack. That is to rent the hashrate. This is what the NiceHash-able percent refers to. Litecoin is 6% NiceHash-able. This means you can rent a total of 6% of the Scrypt hashrate. That's nowhere enough to do a 51% attack.
570,2021-02-14 10:26:58+00:00,SatoshiLite,"10/ This attack is theoretically possible but not practically possible. Satoshi designed this system such it makes more sense for miners to be honest and mine the coin normally, rather than attack the coin and hurt their investment and mining income."
571,2021-02-14 10:26:58+00:00,SatoshiLite,"9/ He will also need tens or hundreds of millions of dollars worth of LTC to perform this attack because he has to deposit these LTC to exchanges and double spend them. After a successful attack, LTC price might crash, which makes the attack even less worthwhile."
572,2021-02-14 10:26:58+00:00,SatoshiLite,"8/ For this attack to be profitable, the attacker will have to make enough money to cover the costs of the attack: $150M upfront + $15k incremental. This is because if he successfully pulls it off, he will destroy the value of his Scrypt miners and won't be able to recoup costs."
573,2021-02-14 10:26:58+00:00,SatoshiLite,"7/ Depending on which miner (A6+ or L3++) you can find, total costs is between $133M to $151M. This is of course assuming you are even able to find and buy that many ASIC miners. I'm talking 149,573 A6+ or 515,201 L3++! And you have to set up a mining farm with cheap electricity. https://t.co/YySJu9tLIM"
574,2021-02-14 10:26:57+00:00,SatoshiLite,6/ But it's not actually this cheap to attack Litecoin. There's also the upfront cost that I first mentioned. This upfront cost can  be calculated by figuring out how much money it costs to buy all the ASICs/GPUs needed to match the hashrate that is currently on Litecoin network.
575,2021-02-14 10:26:57+00:00,SatoshiLite,"5/ This incremental costs can be calculated by calculating the electricity costs to run 51% of the mining hashrate for 30 minutes. https://t.co/HYejqons0V is a useful site to check that cost. We see that right now, it costs about $15,000 to attack Litecoin for 30 minutes. https://t.co/0tjj1QJH59"
576,2021-02-14 10:26:56+00:00,SatoshiLite,"4/ How much time the attacker needs to mine depends on how long it takes for their victim to trust a transaction to be confirmed. So if the attacker is going to reverse some transactions to Coinbase for example, they would need to wait for 12 confirmations, which is 30 minutes."
577,2021-02-14 10:26:56+00:00,SatoshiLite,"3/ On the flip side, we have attackers. In order to 51% attack a coin, they need to have 51% or close to 51% of the network hashrate and they need to mine the coin for some time to build up a 51% attack chain to override the honest chain and reverse some transactions."
578,2021-02-14 10:26:55+00:00,SatoshiLite,"2/ First, let me explain how security works in a POW cryptocurrency. Miners have an upfront cost (cost of hardware like ASICs/GPUs) and an incremental cost (cost of electricity) when mining a coin. To make money, miners have to mine enough coins to cover both costs over time."

780,2020-08-01 16:16:30+00:00,SatoshiLite,@ALHDZMXN The hashing power won't all transfer to ETC. Most will shut down as there's not as much money to be made.

940,2020-05-11 15:58:12+00:00,SatoshiLite,"@blockchain This is also incorrect. Not counting the coins that are lost, there will be a total of 20,999,999.9769 BTC mined but only 20,999,949.9769 BTC is spendable.

941,2020-05-11 15:51:17+00:00,SatoshiLite,"@DeepBlueCrypto @blockchain Yes it prevents fractional rewards. In the code, the reward is stored as an int64 for the number of satoshis."

944,2020-05-11 15:45:59+00:00,SatoshiLite,@MyLegacyKit @blockchain Indeed. Probably got confused by the halving code.
945,2020-05-11 15:36:00+00:00,SatoshiLite,"@blockchain That‚Äôs incorrect. In 2136, the 32nd halving would occur and block rewards go from 2 satoshis to 1 satoshi. In 2140, block rewards would go to 0, so not technically a halving."
946,2020-05-10 18:32:27+00:00,SatoshiLite,@vicariousdrama @danheld @pierre_rochard @aantonop It's the edge case check because bit shifting a 64 bit integer by more than 64 is not defined. This function doesn't make any assumption on the initial block reward other than it's less than or equal to max of an int64 number.

971,2020-05-05 02:56:54+00:00,SatoshiLite,@aantonop @brunojfk I think I know why. CAmount is a 64 bit integer. So you can at most right shift 64 times. Satoshi's code is generic enough to support an initial coin subsidy of int64 max.

By definition, a decentralized cryptocurrency must be susceptible to 51% attacks whether by hashrate, stake, and/or other permissionlessly-acquirable resources.

If a crypto can't be 51% attacked, it is permissioned and centralized."

1911,2019-01-07 20:14:25+00:00,SatoshiLite,"Be careful w/ coins that are not dominant in their respective mining algorithm, especially ones that are NiceHash-able. ETC has less than 5% of the total Ethash hashrate and is 98% NiceHash-able. 1-hr attack costs $5k. Almost $500k has been double spent. https://t.co/REwM2lFA9Z"

1915,2019-01-06 20:11:37+00:00,SatoshiLite,"Some self-proclaimed Bitcoin Maximalists are actually Bitcoin Extremists. They think all other coins are scams and will go to zero.

Maximalists think Bitcoin is and will remain the dominant cryptocurrency but there is room for altcoins to exist and even do well.

What are you?"
