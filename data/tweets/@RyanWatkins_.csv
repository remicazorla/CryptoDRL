741,2021-10-24 17:43:12+00:00,RyanWatkins_,@statelayer @hasufl That‚Äôs fair. But that is more of a liquidity issue than a solvency issue. Liquidity issues can be alleviated with a stability module.

1158,2021-06-24 13:35:43+00:00,RyanWatkins_,"So in short, cross-chain liquidity protocols are not only a superset of decentralized custodian protocols, but potentially may offer the only scalable way to do decentralized custody."
1159,2021-06-24 13:35:42+00:00,RyanWatkins_,"Cross-chain liquidity protocols like @THORChain have taken this path to decentralized custody by pairing custody with exchange, lending, and synthetic assets.

The idea is that the combination of those will provide sufficient returns to incentivize nodes to stake enough capital."
1160,2021-06-24 13:35:42+00:00,RyanWatkins_,It is likely that doing the same may offer the only scalable model for decentralized custody under the constraints of the high capital requirements needed.
1161,2021-06-24 13:35:42+00:00,RyanWatkins_,"Even without the overcollaterallization requirements, centralized custodians recognize the unattractiveness of their business.

This leads them to enter new and adjacent markets and is why we see custody in crypto often paired with businesses such as exchange and staking."
1162,2021-06-24 13:35:41+00:00,RyanWatkins_,We can turn to the centralized custodians once again for insight.
1163,2021-06-24 13:35:41+00:00,RyanWatkins_,"The model doesn‚Äôt scale easily, it‚Äôs just too capital inefficient.

You can‚Äôt just expect the staking token to be worth enough without requisite yield."
1164,2021-06-24 13:35:41+00:00,RyanWatkins_,"So with this in mind overcollateralized decentralized custodians face a serious challenge.

How can they attract enough capital when realistically they‚Äôre only returning &lt;1% to nodes per year into perpetuity?"
1165,2021-06-24 13:35:40+00:00,RyanWatkins_,"The difference however is that clients of traditional custodians can rely on a legal system to keep their assets secure.

So we don‚Äôt need BNY Mellon to have $37 trillion at stake to properly secure their $37 trillion in assets under custody. That would be ridiculous."
1166,2021-06-24 13:35:40+00:00,RyanWatkins_,"As mentioned previously the economics of custody are poor. 

Coinbase for example only receives 50bps annualized for custodying assets.

For traditional finance custodians like Bank of New York Mellon it‚Äôs more than an order of magnitude lower."
1167,2021-06-24 13:35:40+00:00,RyanWatkins_,"The above is why many of these protocols such as Ren and Keep have overcollateralizion requirements - it‚Äôs necessary for security in an environment where you can‚Äôt rely on trust.

The issue boils down to incentivizing those nodes to put up enough stake to secure assets custodied."
1168,2021-06-24 13:35:39+00:00,RyanWatkins_,"Fundamentally nodes securing pegged assets must have more at stake than the assets they‚Äôre custodying. 

So if nodes custody $1 billion they must have more at stake than $1 billion otherwise they‚Äôd just steal the assets they‚Äôre custodying."
1169,2021-06-24 13:35:38+00:00,RyanWatkins_,"I‚Äôm increasingly skeptical of the economic viability of pegged asset protocols. 

The issue is that decentralized custody - a requirement for such protocols - is an inherently low margin business and won‚Äôt provide enough returns to nodes to sufficiently incentivize security.

2325,2020-12-07 16:38:04+00:00,RyanWatkins_,"Having CVP in each index, ensures that index holders have a voice in PowerPool governance and ensures that PowerPool will only be successful if it does its job well."
2326,2020-12-07 16:38:04+00:00,RyanWatkins_,"In short, meta-governance for each PowerPool index is not just a feature of PowerPool indices, it‚Äôs at the core of what PowerPool indices do. 

This is why it presented itself as the best solution to use to launch YETI."
2327,2020-12-07 16:38:03+00:00,RyanWatkins_,This dynamic also provides the ancillary benefit of scaling Index liquidity mining rewards with total value locked (TVL increases --&gt; higher CVP price --&gt; higher CVP rewards).
2328,2020-12-07 16:38:03+00:00,RyanWatkins_,"These CVP price movements will occur deterministically based on the TVL in the pool because CVP must account for a fixed percentage of the pool.

This dynamic provides strong incentives for CVP holders to do what's best for the composite protocols of each index."
2329,2020-12-07 16:38:03+00:00,RyanWatkins_,"If CVP holders do their job poorly (making clearly bad decisions for index composite protocols), users will withdraw their governance tokens from the index, decreasing total value locked in PowerIndex and negatively influencing CVP token price."
2330,2020-12-07 16:38:03+00:00,RyanWatkins_,"If CVP holders do their job well, more users will supply their governance tokens to the index, increasing the total value locked in PowerIndex and positively influencing the CVP token price."
2331,2020-12-07 16:38:02+00:00,RyanWatkins_,"For example, based on the initial weightings for PIPT, CVP must make up 12.5% of the total value locked in the PowerIndex pool.

What this does is create skin in the game for CVP holders to ensure they are aligned with the governance of underlying DeFi tokens in PowerIndex. https://t.co/aZ0W3C9uaq"
2332,2020-12-07 16:38:01+00:00,RyanWatkins_,The second and perhaps more important reason why CVP is included in each index is to align incentives between PowerPool and the underlying tokens (protocols) in its indices.
2333,2020-12-07 16:38:01+00:00,RyanWatkins_,PowerPool‚Äôs governance system was designed so that users providing liquidity can simultaneously use their CVP to participate in governance. https://t.co/512RR9DIbH
2334,2020-12-07 16:37:59+00:00,RyanWatkins_,"Index token holders will be able to vote on all proposals and collect rewards using this CVP locked in the index.

For example each PIPT (PowerPool‚Äôs first index) holder's voting power will be a function of their share of the 12.5% of CVP in the PowerIndex pool."
2335,2020-12-07 16:37:59+00:00,RyanWatkins_,"CVP is included in each PowerPool index for two reasons.

2346,2020-12-03 02:44:28+00:00,RyanWatkins_,"But if it is the case that Ethereum becomes more scarce than Bitcoin, and it‚Äôs security model is more sustainable, both due to PoS, then what will that imply for ETH‚Äôs monetary properties vs Bitcoin‚Äôs?"
2347,2020-12-03 02:44:28+00:00,RyanWatkins_,"It will be exciting to see the consequences of each‚Äôs approach to monetary policy and how it will affect their properties as money.

Is security more important or is ‚Äúmonetary perfection‚Äù important?

It‚Äôs to be determined."
2348,2020-12-03 02:44:27+00:00,RyanWatkins_,"But the two approaches to monetary policy have their trade offs. 

Ethereum‚Äôs monetary policy can be hard to quantify and communicate.

While Bitcoin‚Äôs monetary policy sets its security budget arbitrarily."
2349,2020-12-03 02:44:27+00:00,RyanWatkins_,"Ethereum‚Äôs monetary policy is optimized for security.

This is in opposition to Bitcoin‚Äôs monetary policy which optimizes for ‚Äúmonetary perfection‚Äù (fixed supply and deterministic issuance schedule).

The benefit is that Bitcoin‚Äôs monetary policy is ùó∫ùòÇùó∞ùóµ easier to communicate"
2350,2020-12-03 02:44:27+00:00,RyanWatkins_,"Ethereum‚Äôs monetary policy can be defined as ‚ÄúMinimum Necessary Issuance‚Äù - the minimum amount of issuance necessary to ensure Ethereum remains secure.

2351,2020-12-03 02:44:26+00:00,RyanWatkins_,"Many may still look at the above insurance schedule and be skeptical.

‚ÄúEthereum‚Äôs monetary policy seems too fluid and unstable‚Äù

But they‚Äôd also be missing what Ethereum‚Äôs monetary policy truly is."
2352,2020-12-03 02:44:26+00:00,RyanWatkins_,"But Phase 1.5 is anywhere from 12-24  months out.

In the meantime, Ethereum‚Äôs annual issuance rate will actually increase because ETH 2 issuance will be incremental to ETH1.x before the merge.

Important to note though that this incremental issuance is both temporary minimal. https://t.co/EHqnmZft8S"
2353,2020-12-03 02:44:25+00:00,RyanWatkins_,Combine this lower issuance with transaction fee burns (EIP 1559) and there‚Äôs the potential for Ethereum‚Äôs annual issuance rate to drop negative - all while still staying secure.
2354,2020-12-03 02:44:24+00:00,RyanWatkins_,In other words PoS allows Ethereum to achieve an equal amount of security while issuing significantly less ETH.
2355,2020-12-03 02:44:24+00:00,RyanWatkins_,"Higher capital costs are good because that increases the cost to attack Ethereum.

And the benefit of this is that Ethereum can get an equal amount of security for less dollar rewards (ETH issuance)."
2356,2020-12-03 02:44:24+00:00,RyanWatkins_,"One of the core value propositions of PoS is that stakers are theoretically more willing to pay significantly higher capital costs per a dollar of rewards.

This is because they only face an opportunity cost on their investment and don‚Äôt experience any depreciation (like ASICs)."
2357,2020-12-03 02:44:24+00:00,RyanWatkins_,"If you‚Äôre an Ethereum skeptic you‚Äôre probably thinking ‚Äúhow is this possible?‚Äù

2362,2020-12-02 02:02:41+00:00,RyanWatkins_,"The takeaway for investors?

ETH does not fit into a neatly defined bucket.

It is a complete re-imagination of what money is in a blockchain-based economy.

The best way to understand ETH is just to look at it from first principles and appreciate its various drivers of value."
2363,2020-12-02 02:02:40+00:00,RyanWatkins_,"Why do all these properties matter?

They all are sources of demand for ETH in ETH 2.0.

2365,2020-12-02 02:02:40+00:00,RyanWatkins_,"Similarly ETH‚Äôs claim on transaction fees makes ETH act more like equity in that it has a claim on future fees from users demanding to transact on Ethereum.

EIP 1559 will likely burn the majority of transaction fees, but some variable portion of fees will be paid to stakers."
2366,2020-12-02 02:02:39+00:00,RyanWatkins_,"Unlike bonds which have maturity dates at which time bond holders are paid back their principal, stakers can stake their ETH and receive yield forever."
2367,2020-12-02 02:02:39+00:00,RyanWatkins_,"However, Ethereum‚Äôs bond-like characteristics are only half the picture. 

Two key features that make ETH equity-like as well are its perpetual nature and its claim on Ethereum‚Äôs transaction fees."
2368,2020-12-02 02:02:39+00:00,RyanWatkins_,"Like sovereign bonds that are issued in a sovereigns own currency, there is no default risk (nominally) with an Ethereum bond.

Ethereum can guarantee to pay out stakers so long as the Ethereum blockchain remains alive
because it pays stakers in its own currency."
2369,2020-12-02 02:02:38+00:00,RyanWatkins_,"...and the reason why Ethereum issues this ‚Äúbond‚Äù in the first place is to raise capital for security.

2370,2020-12-02 02:02:37+00:00,RyanWatkins_,"ETH 2.0 introduces staking which will provide ETH with capital asset properties - it will be used to generate income through staking.

This analogy to oil will be especially powerful once EIP-1559 is implemented and the majority of tx fees are burned - literally converting ETH into block space."
2372,2020-12-02 02:02:36+00:00,RyanWatkins_,"Let‚Äôs start with ETH‚Äôs properties in ETH 1.x.

In ETH 1.x ETH possesses store of value properties through its use as collateral in DeFi and use as Ethereum‚Äôs native currency."
