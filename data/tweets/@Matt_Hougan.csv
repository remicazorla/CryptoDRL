2,2023-02-23 14:02:04+00:00,Matt_Hougan,This is going to be fun. I'm so bullish on the next three years in crypto and can't wait to share why.
3,2023-02-14 22:10:35+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"The amount of ETH in existence peaked on 10/8/22. 

Falling supply + rising demand = ???"
4,2023-02-14 22:07:39+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"So excited to speak @Permissionless this year. 

It is ""the"" must-attend for any professional investor who is deeply interested in crypto."
5,2023-02-10 00:08:50+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"This is a critical point.

Shadow-banning individuals industries from the banking system is the slipperiest of slopes.

We do not want a politicized banking system."
6,2023-01-18 17:11:32+00:00,Matt_Hougan,How everyone in crypto feels at the moment.
7,2023-01-09 18:54:22+00:00,Matt_Hougan,Awesome to see. Congrats to a great team!  Excited to see what's next for @Vetta_Fi
8,2022-12-21 03:13:41+00:00,Matt_Hougan,One of the best people I‚Äôve had the honor of knowing.  An absolute legend.

25,2022-11-10 14:46:11+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"The gap between Crypto Twitter and Wall Street on the outlook for Silvergate Bank right now is incredible.

CT is panicking - leverage! loans! - while sell-side analysts are reaffirming triple-digit price targets.

Great test case for the regulation of centralized crypto finance."
26,2022-11-09 19:48:24+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"My initial thoughts on FTX, and where we go from here, are below."
27,2022-11-09 19:47:38+00:00,Matt_Hougan,@AlexanderGrieve Thank you.  Agreed.
28,2022-11-09 16:52:01+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"I‚Äôm in Miami, with a hurricane offshore, talking to a room of clients about crypto.  Feels right."
29,2022-11-09 16:33:19+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"I'm not saying I called this in any way -- I didn't, and I was a fan of SBF -- but recognizing our obvious blindspots in hindsight may help open our eyes to future issues."
30,2022-11-09 16:33:18+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"I guess one takeaway is that if someone is: 



1) Running a large crypto exchange 

2) Domiciled in an unregulated offshore location

3) Simulatenously operating a parallel ‚Äútrading firm‚Äù generating incredible profits across all types of markets



We should ask questions."
31,2022-11-09 16:13:54+00:00,Matt_Hougan,@jameswester Agreed.
32,2022-11-09 16:05:33+00:00,Matt_Hougan,The destination hasn't changed. But the road just got longer.
33,2022-11-09 15:51:53+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"@newmoneyreview Yes, that turned out to be true.  It's disappointing. Crypto needs to do better."
34,2022-11-09 00:52:31+00:00,Matt_Hougan,@DaveNadig @ppearlman The problem with fake meat is vegetarians want to eat vegetables and meat eaters want to eat meat.
35,2022-11-08 21:15:57+00:00,Matt_Hougan,Reminds me of Napster. What fixed that problem overnight was not regulation; it was Apple creating a reasonably priced legal alternative.
36,2022-11-08 21:14:01+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"This is a good thread in general, but this particular tweet is important."
37,2022-11-08 17:56:09+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"Crypto has created so much wealth it's been able to cover gross managerial failures. But these events damage the ecosystem.

We need entities/systems we can rely on. So far, two paradigms seem to work:

* DeFi (Uniswap, Aave, etc.)
* Full regulation (Coinbase, Bitwise, etc.)"
38,2022-11-07 14:08:30+00:00,Matt_Hougan,The crypto industry needs to remember that building the market is more important than building market share right now.
39,2022-11-04 15:58:49+00:00,Matt_Hougan,See you all in Miami!
40,2022-11-04 02:00:24+00:00,Matt_Hougan,Love to see our analysts @BitwiseInvest breaking down miner earnings.
41,2022-11-01 17:01:24+00:00,Matt_Hougan,Big day for @BitwiseInvest. So excited for what we are building here.
42,2022-10-29 21:38:10+00:00,Matt_Hougan,Strongly agree with this. It‚Äôs why we need voices like @SBF_FTX.

44,2022-10-27 14:22:21+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"There's not much difference between firms like FTX creating their own stablecoin and Charles Schwab forcing customers to use its (and only its) money market funds all these years.

Brokers and exchanges find ways to monetize customer cash.

45,2022-10-27 14:11:00+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"I bet this is right. 

META is trading at 2015 levels. It's being punished because Zuck is still searching for transformative growth, while Wall Street wants it to transform into a stripped-down cash cow."
46,2022-10-27 14:07:38+00:00,Matt_Hougan,@TweetsByJKim Thanks!

48,2022-10-26 22:31:47+00:00,Matt_Hougan,@dillyri Thanks!
49,2022-10-26 19:07:33+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"10/ This aligns with what I hear from institutional investors and financial advisors each day. They are still watching crypto, learning, and doing due diligence.

It makes me pretty excited for 2023."
50,2022-10-26 19:07:33+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"9/ Still, there is an important lesson here.

Over the past year, investors have been forced to the sidelines by a challenging macro environment. But they have not lost interest in crypto. They're just waiting for the all-clear.

Once it comes, they will be ready to jump back in."
51,2022-10-26 19:07:32+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"8/ Add those together, and you get big up days. 

So where do we go from here?

If I'm being honest, this feels like a bear market rally; I would not be surprised to see the market pull back from these highs. 

Generally, I think there's more volatility ahead this year."
52,2022-10-26 19:07:32+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"7/ The accelerant was short liquidations. People were caught leaning the wrong way, and had to buy to cover their shorts.

FTX, for instance, reported its largest short liquidations ever, at almost a billion dollars."
53,2022-10-26 19:07:32+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"6/ The spark came Tuesday morning when two big events occurred.

First, we had bad consumer confidence numbers. The market read this as: ""We may be getting close to the end of the rate-hiking cycle.""

Then we had Yellen tell us she's ready to buy bonds. Say what? Pivot already?"
54,2022-10-26 19:07:31+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"5/ In fact, in some areas, they've retrenched.

Take crypto stocks. Companies like Silvergate have reported strong growth, with revenues up 50% year-over-year and a sunny outlook for 2023. 

But the stock has been crushed, trading at a forward P/E of ~8x.

The fuel was there."
55,2022-10-26 19:07:31+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"4/ The fuel IMHO was that crypto is too cheap.

In recent months, we‚Äôve seen meaningful technological progress (ETH‚Äôs Merge), regulatory progress (the emerging stablecoin bill), strong VC flows, and solid developer activity. 

But prices have gone nowhere."
56,2022-10-26 19:07:30+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"3/ For a wildfire to occur, you need three things: 

1) Fuel ‚Äî the right starting conditions
2) A spark ‚Äî something to actually start the fire
3) An accelerant ‚Äî  something to drive the growth

We had all three in the crypto markets recently. And that‚Äôs why we‚Äôre up big."
57,2022-10-26 19:07:30+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"2/ Note: This is not investment advice. 

These tweets reflect my personal assessment of the market, and not the views of Bitwise Asset Management. They are not predictions."
58,2022-10-26 19:07:29+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"1/ ETH is up 20% over the past few days, and crypto stocks are up 15%.

You might be wondering, why?  

A helpful analogy to explain these moves is to think about a wildfire."
59,2022-10-22 00:40:56+00:00,Matt_Hougan,Great hire.  @Blockworks_ is building a massive franchise in crypto.
60,2022-10-21 18:22:31+00:00,Matt_Hougan,Tax-loss harvesting is one of the most important opportunities for crypto investors to conisder as we approach year-end.
61,2022-10-20 17:43:28+00:00,Matt_Hougan,Cool to see @Vetta_Fi continue to bring the advisor community together. Building a powerful data-linked franchise where 1+1 can equal 3.
62,2022-10-20 16:47:54+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"What's happening in Silvergate today is important.

It's the first time Wall Street analysts have collectively said a crypto stock has gotten too cheap.

JP Morgan is calling it ""a very attractive risk/reward.‚Äù

https://t.co/e3suVq2OY8"
63,2022-10-20 16:40:34+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"Great conversation.

The best thing I said was that crypto has gotten the priority stack of institutions backward.

We've been talking (in order) pensions, endowments, hedge funds, family offices, and financial advisors.

The order folks will invest is precisely the opposite."

90,2022-08-26 14:23:04+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"3/ The implications of this, imho, is that Powell will raise more than the market expects and keep rates higher longer than the market wants. His Jackson Hole speech aligns with that view."
91,2022-08-26 14:23:03+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"2/ History looks more favorably upon Fed chairs who quash inflation over those that support growth.

Ben Bernanke arguably saved the world from collapse during the GFC with creative central banking. But his legacy is mixed while Volcker is viewed with pure reverence."
92,2022-08-26 14:23:03+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"1/ The right mental model for Jerome Powell is as follows:

He wakes up every day, looks in the mirror, and says: ""History will not remember me as the next G. William Miller."" (The Fed Chair before Paul Volcker)."

From 72-74, then-Chair Burns took rates from 3%&gt;13% in an effort to beat emerging inflation. This created a severe recession, and Burns reversed course, cutting rates to 4% by '76."

227,2022-01-11 23:03:16+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"3/ Crypto‚Äôs chipped at this wall in various ways over the years: Remittances, El Salvador, DeFi, Tom Brady...

The best effort to date has probably been art-based NFTs: Auctions at Christie‚Äôs, Jay-Z changing his Twitter avatar to a Cryptopunk, etc., all pushed crypto mainstream."
228,2022-01-11 23:03:16+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"2/ I spend my days talking to traditional investors about crypto. One of the biggest issues is that they don‚Äôt see crypto impacting the ‚Äúreal world.‚Äù

It‚Äôs a hollow objection, of course: The digital world is just as real as the analog world.

But it comes up time and again."
229,2022-01-11 23:03:15+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"1/ The @join_royal music NFT drop is one of the biggest things happening in crypto this month.

It demonstrates the real power of NFTs - even to skeptics - and shows two things:
 
1) Crypto impacting the ‚Äúreal world‚Äù
2) Crypto enabling things you can‚Äôt do other ways.

A thread."
230,2022-01-11 19:06:47+00:00,Matt_Hougan,Much needed! This is a big deal for the events industry.
231,2022-01-11 18:21:23+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"Today's @join_royal Nas drop is going to be a milestone for traditional investors understanding the power of NFTs. 

The music-rights-as-NFT narrative is very easy for most people to understand.

Overwhelming demand has crashed the servers for now, but that'll get figured out."
232,2022-01-09 23:45:57+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"It's an emerging store of value, which (as I discussed with Gayed on his pod) is the only kind of store of value worth investing in :)"

Agree with Mark's analysis that the technicals are ugly, even if the fundamentals look stronger than ever (record developer activity, user, fee revenue, VC investment, etc.). Also, think the absence of obvious near-term catalysts is weighting on the market."

(I also think NFTs as a technology changes the game materially as well. Fun convo!)"
242,2022-01-05 16:45:13+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"@philbak1 Agree applications outside of art/collectibles are bigger than the art/collectible market, just not robust yet.

The collectible thing is hard for some to see, easier to feel (fall in love with an NFT, buy, join the Discord, etc.). But not for everyone &amp; not required for anyone!"
243,2022-01-05 16:21:04+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"@DaveNadig Oh, I agree with that.  I just meant that the copying is irrelevant and a red herring.  Copying/forgery/etc. has always been mostly irrelevant in art, i.e., the 8 billion fake Koons balloon dogs don't invalidate the real ones."

253,2022-01-04 16:28:51+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"@CraigSalm I see the NFT-as-technology bit as an internet-native solution to provenance. 

But the real answer on Beeple, of course, is that the native audience for Beeple's art had very little money pre-crypto."
254,2022-01-04 15:00:14+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"10/ But NFTs are interesting and fun, and they touch a lot of behavioral biases: People undervalue digital items, skew against youth, and dislike things that are different. 

If we‚Äôre going to seriously engage with them, we should at least be talking about the right issues."
255,2022-01-04 15:00:13+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"9/ The NFT market is certain to be volatile. Prices are up a lot in the past year, which should give people pause. Collectible crazes can unravel quickly, and many or most NFTs are probably worth zero. Also, there are also real issues around IP rights, fraud, theft, etc."
256,2022-01-04 15:00:13+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"8/ Importantly this is an ongoing trend. Over the next 10-20 years, we are going to experience a historic transfer of wealth from a primarily analog generation to a primarily digital one. The idea that this generation won‚Äôt want its own genre of art and collectibles seems odd."
257,2022-01-04 15:00:12+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"7/ I don‚Äôt love some of the art either. But the rise of crypto has created a new generation of digitally native wealth ‚Ä¶ some $2+ trillion. This generation values the digital world, decentralization, and liquidity. Are we surprised it has its own art, different from before?"
258,2022-01-04 15:00:12+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"6/ Criticism 3: The art is ‚Äúbad.‚Äù

Says who?
 
Every older generation looks down on the next generation‚Äôs art.  Check out the early reviews of Jackson Pollock. Or jazz: Thomas Edison said it sounded better played backward."
259,2022-01-04 15:00:11+00:00,Matt_Hougan,5/ History suggests that the more an artwork is copied the more valuable the original becomes. NFTs can be infinitely copied but are impossible to forge. This is a huge benefit that accrues entirely to the owner of the artwork.
260,2022-01-04 15:00:11+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"4/ Criticism 2: Right-click-and-save.

To borrow a common retort: How many T-shirts, mugs, and postcards are there of the Mona Lisa?  Each one is an advertisement for the original. Together, they have rendered it priceless."
261,2022-01-04 15:00:10+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"3/ Alternatively, you buy an NFT and post it as your Twitter avatar. You showcase your taste, wealth and worldview to your community. Instead of hundreds of people, you show it to millions.
 
The digital world scales in a way the physical world can‚Äôt. That includes art."
262,2022-01-04 15:00:09+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"2/ Criticism 1: It‚Äôs just a jpeg.
 
There‚Äôs a belief people buy art b/c it‚Äôs pretty. Sure, but it's really cultural signaling. You buy a Warhol or a Calder and invite your friends over to see it, showcasing your taste, wealth &amp; worldview. Maybe 100-200 ppl see it per year."

We have Boy-Who-Cried-Wolf syndrome. But it's actually a biggish piece of what will drive the market in 2022."
265,2022-01-03 23:24:46+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"@RyanSAdams A parallel effect: For parts of the TradFi community, NFTs have shifted the Overton window for crypto.

Many find $500k Bored Apes unfathomable. But high-value NFTs selling at Christie's has made BTC, ETH and even DeFi seem totally normal."

309,2021-11-11 10:41:13+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"@mj_bitcoin Leverage is interesting, although there are complications and costs, particularly in volatile assets.

But more than that, the SEC is not allowing leveraged bitcoin futures ETFs at the moment, so that door is closed as well."

312,2021-11-10 22:42:48+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"8/ Ultimately, what many investors want is a spot bitcoin ETF. We think that's possible:  https://t.co/lRBxAK3DKv

So Bitwise will continue to pursue that goal, and we will look for other ways to help investors get access to the incredible opportunities in crypto.

More to come."
313,2021-11-10 22:42:48+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"8/ None of this means that futures-based ETFs are bad, and $BITO and $BTF are thoughtful versions. 

But we believe most long-term investors would be better served by spot exposure, and today, there are many options for getting spot-based exposure ‚Äî including other Bitwise funds."
314,2021-11-10 22:42:47+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"7/ In addition, as reported by @kgreifeld, bitcoin futures ETFs have already soaked up all available capacity at futures commission merchants.

This will ease over time, but for now, it‚Äôs added yet another expense.

The result? Costs on top of costs, plus added complexity."
315,2021-11-10 22:42:47+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"6/ For instance, we initially believed it would be possible to hold both futures and Canadian-listed bitcoin ETPs in a 1940 Act ETF.
 
Tax laws make it costly to gain 100% exposure to futures, so flexibility could have lowered costs. 

Unfortunately, that‚Äôs not permitted ATM."
316,2021-11-10 22:42:47+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"5/ Sure enough, that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre seeing: Contango today is running a bit over 6%/year.

Still, we filed our application, as we thought the benefits of the ETF wrapper (convenience, access) would outweigh the contango challenge.

Since then, however, new challenges have emerged."
317,2021-11-10 22:42:46+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"3/ Any ETF is a big step, so this was a real breakthrough ‚Ä¶ although of course, we knew there would be challenges.

For one, bitcoin futures have historically traded in contango. As a result, a rolling bitcoin futures ETF will generally underperform spot bitcoin."

Folks, this doesn't happen. 

Large financial competitors sat on the sidelines for so long, terrified of crypto. Now, it's too late. 

Incredible story."
329,2021-11-02 19:35:54+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"Crypto stocks have historically been overlooked by the market.

TradFi ignores them because they're crypto. Crypto natives ignore them because they prefer tokens. The result: High-growth, high-profit stocks trading at constrained valuations.

Seems like the market woke up today."

The answer is that it makes it easy for financial advisors to gain exposure to bitcoin.  Imperfect exposure, maybe, but exposure nonetheless. Ease-of-use is a big deal.

373,2021-10-19 17:20:11+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"@dertomini The low cost of storing bitcoin should cap the levels of contango at a somewhat reasonable rate. That's one important difference between bitcoin and (say) crude oil. 

But it's still relatively pricey for folks to arb the trade, as the capital commitments are high."
374,2021-10-19 16:28:48+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"FWIW, I suspect trading will tail off after this initial burst; that's true of most ETF launches.

But $BITO and other bitcoin futures ETFs are here to stay. 

They offer a new option for traditional investors looking to access the crypto markets, with pros, cons, etc."
375,2021-10-19 16:28:48+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"How should you interpret the strong early trading in $BITO? 

It shows that investors want to access bitcoin through brokerage accounts.

Lots of people questioned this, noting that you can already buy bitcoin through apps, custodians, etc.  

But ease-of-use is a killer app."

380,2021-10-18 22:33:01+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"9/ My guess? Futures ETFs will end up as great tools for short-term traders and ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù tools for long-term investors who need an ETF to access the market. That‚Äôs what we see with other futures ETFs, like USO.

Of course, the sooner we get a spot bitcoin ETF the better."
381,2021-10-18 22:33:01+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"8/ Thanks to compounding, the contango headwind can multiply. 

Over the past 12 months, for instance, spot bitcoin is up 441%, while a rolling position in bitcoin futures is up 384% (according to the Horizons rolling futures index). 

That‚Äôs a gap.

https://t.co/8RzLFNgoAm"
382,2021-10-18 22:33:00+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"7/ How much?  It depends. 

You‚Äôll see a lot of reporting that says that contango costs have averaged around 5% per year in bitcoin. Historically, that‚Äôs true.  

But if bitcoin is up 300%, that doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôll be up 295%.

Why?"
383,2021-10-18 22:33:00+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"6/ What does this mean for bitcoin futures ETFs? 

Futures-based ETFs generally buy the front-month futures contract, hold it almost to expiration, and roll over to the next contract. 

If the market is in contango when they buy, they will tend to trail the spot price over time."
384,2021-10-18 22:33:00+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"5/ Futures markets aren't always like this. Markets can also be in ""backwardation,"" where futures contracts are priced lower than spot.

Historically, however, the CME bitcoin futures market has traded in contango most of the time."
385,2021-10-18 22:33:00+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"4/ Contango creates a headwind for investors. If you buy the Oct. futures contract now -- and the spot price doesn‚Äôt change before Oct. 29 at 11am -- you'll lose money.

Why?  

Because you‚Äôll pay $61,900 but only get $61,743. You‚Äôll be out $157, or 0.25% of your  investment."
386,2021-10-18 22:32:59+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"3/ You can monitor contango by comparing the current price of bitcoin futures with the spot price.

Spot prices are easy to find on venues like Coinbase; futures prices are available here:

https://t.co/8k5usQ9ICp"
387,2021-10-18 22:32:59+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"2/ Contango is how you describe a market where the futures price is higher than the spot price.  

For instance, right now, the ‚Äúfront month‚Äù bitcoin futures contract - which expires on October 29 at 11am ET - is trading for $61,900. But the spot price of BTC is only $61,743."
388,2021-10-18 22:32:59+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"1/ ‚ÄúContango‚Äù: What is it? Does it really matter? How much impact can it have?

With a futures-based bitcoin ETFs launching tomorrow, a lot of people are asking about contango. It‚Äôs a unique &amp; important part of all futures-based ETFs.

Let‚Äôs run through it.

390,2021-10-18 16:18:49+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"Wondering how big the new bitcoin futures ETFs might get?

391,2021-10-18 16:09:50+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"@mhadden32 @DaveNadig @EricBalchunas @mikemcglone11 There's no guarantee that going forward out the curve will increase roll costs. Depends on the shape of the curve. The challenge is that liquidity falls off significantly after the front month. Current open interest in contracts:

Oct.: 7,391
Nov.: 809
Dec.: 155
Jan.: 36"
392,2021-10-18 14:05:03+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"@DaveNadig @EricBalchunas @mikemcglone11 My friend @mikemcglone11 is right, as always. But with compounding, that 5% headwind is significant. 

The right way to think of it imho is akin to a variable expense ratio. The all-in realized expense on these funds is not 1%; it's likely north of 5% with the roll."
393,2021-10-18 13:41:26+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"@EricBalchunas @DaveNadig Most will hedge with physical bitcoin or offshore derivatives. A few will find natural shorts on the other side.

FWIW, the fact that hedging to physical is pretty cheap should constrain the level of contango, although we'll see."
394,2021-10-18 13:37:43+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"@duerr_m To qualify for good tax treatment, futures-based ETFs run through Cayman subs. You're only allowed to put ~25% of your capital into the sub.  CME allows 3-1 leverage on bitcoin futures.  There's some wiggle but not much.

395,2021-10-16 17:30:30+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"@EconomPic @NateGeraci My guess is people are underestimating the impact. It's not just the roll yield ... its compounding that roll yield with market returns.

C. Tail risk: Remember $USO in 2020? Position limits, liquidity, etc ‚Äî things can break.

A. Costs: It could cost over 5-10% per year to roll the futures (‚Äúcontango‚Äù). Plus another 1-2% in fees.

B. Dilution: ETFs can't hold 100% BTC futures due to rules. Most aim for 85%. So, 15% is other stuff, even bonds!

It would hold actual BTC, *not* futures.

There‚Äôs already a separate BTC futures-based Bitwise ETF filing. But actual BTC is better.

Most successes to date have used one of two hacks: 1) Creating a walled garden (PayPal) or 2) Using uncollateralized short-term loans to paper over the archaic back-end (instant funding, etc.). It's duct tape and bailing wire.  Imagine what fintech can do unleashed!"

485,2021-08-26 19:52:18+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"12/12  NFT natives may not find the project interesting, as it straddles the line, rather than embracing the NFT ecosystem completely.  

But in so doing, it can help people from outside the crypto world think more clearly about why and how NFTs (and art in general) have value."
486,2021-08-26 19:52:18+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"11/12 But the Hirst NFT/painting hybrids are unquestionably valuable, and directly ask the question: Why do we value art?

Because of its physical presence? Because of what it makes us think about? Because of its social signaling? Because it helps define community?"
487,2021-08-26 19:52:17+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"10/12 Everyone who is skeptical about NFTs asks: ‚ÄúHow do they have any value.‚Äù  They're just jpgs!

That's an easy shot to take at a picture of a cute penguin. I could explain the value by talking about networking and social signaling and such, but the answer is complex."
488,2021-08-26 19:52:17+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"9/12 It reminds me a little of Banksy‚Äôs shredded painting, which became more valuable after it was shredded than it was before that ""shocking"" event."
489,2021-08-26 19:52:17+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"8/12 I don‚Äôt think the answer is obvious. In fact, I have a strong suspicion that the NFTs will be more valuable in the end. 

In part, because the first Hirst NFT has a bigger place in the history of art than the umpteen-thousandth Hirst dot painting."
490,2021-08-26 19:52:17+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"7/12  But by forcing people to choose the NFT or the painting, Hirst makes people confront the ‚Äúvalue‚Äù of art. 

Which will be more valuable? A small painting of dots you can hang on a wall, or an NFT you can own that raises fundamental questions about the nature of art?"
491,2021-08-26 19:52:16+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"6/12 Hirst has been doing dot paintings for a long time, and there is an extensive history of those paintings selling for significant amounts of money. 

As a result, it's impossible to argue the paintings have no value, as people say about various NFTs."
492,2021-08-26 19:52:16+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"5/12 The fun part is: After a year, the owners have to decide: Do they want to keep the NFT or the physical painting? 

Whichever they choose, the other gets destroyed."
493,2021-08-26 19:52:16+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"4/12 What‚Äôs wonderful Hirst‚Äôs The Currency -- particularly for non-NFT-natives -- is how it is structured. Hirst created 10,000 actual paintings of dots and put them into a vault, then auctioned NFTs linked to each painting."
494,2021-08-26 19:52:16+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"3/12 Given his obsession with the art/money collide, it is not surprising that he was fast to enter the NFT world."
495,2021-08-26 19:52:15+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"2/12 Hirst is, of course, one of the most successful and important artists of this generation.  

A lot of his work stands at the intersection of art &amp; money. For example, he created a human skull encrusted in diamonds. It sold for $100m. Art?  Money?"

575,2021-04-14 03:56:10+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"@ramahluwalia Agreed!  I think the answer is, if any ETF is approved, they'll pivot to altcoins and the general theme of ""doing stuff with crypto"" (i.e., staking, lending, etc.)."
576,2021-04-13 21:43:59+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"3/For TradFi : Yes, costs will come down for buying bitcoin. But Coinbase‚Äôs revenue mix will change over time to focus on institutional/staking/lending/altcoins. The right analogy is Schwab, which started out making money from commissions and morphed to profiting from carry."
577,2021-04-13 21:43:59+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"2/For crypto natives: Yes, decentralized apps like Uniswap will disrupt venues like Coinbase over time. But even as they steal Coinbase‚Äôs most-crypto-savvy customers, the company will bring in 2x that in traditional investors who aren‚Äôt currently involved in crypto at all."
578,2021-04-13 21:43:58+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"1/Crypto natives think Coinbase is doomed because of competition from decentralized exchanges.



Traditional finance people think Coinbase is doomed because a crypto exchange can‚Äôt possibly be as big as NASDAQ and will never protect its margins.



They‚Äôre both wrong."

581,2021-04-10 00:33:24+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"@philbak1 IMHO we are a bit further from investors prioritizing price over trust and UX than many people believe in crypto.  But it‚Äôs a good question to ask.

Longer term, you‚Äôll probably see Coinbase‚Äôs revenue source evolve, much like Schwab‚Äôs has"
582,2021-04-10 00:11:22+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"@innovate_fin lol. Certainly possible. But Facebook has compounded at 22% since its IPO, the initial dip notwithstanding. 
  Top-tier for equities over that time."
583,2021-04-10 00:09:11+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"@philbak1 For bitcoin or for crypto (both altcoins and ""doing stuff with crypto"" - staking, lending, yield-farming, etc.)?  

I think there two different answers to that question, at least over the next few years."
584,2021-04-09 23:55:20+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"Facebook‚Äôs 2012 IPO is a good template for understanding Coinbase‚Äôs IPO next week.

645,2021-02-23 19:06:57+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"@newmoneyreview I agree, Paul. I just think the genesis is important.

The reason people care about Tether is not because of Tether. They care because of BTC and worries about the accusations in the Griffin-Shams paper. Understanding the origin helps contextualize those accusations."
646,2021-02-23 17:30:45+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"@newmoneyreview Well, no Paul. But it certainly looks like Tether turned to shady ""payment processors"" because it couldn't access the traditional banking system. Then, when money went missing, they made multiple mistakes trying to cover it up.  It doesn't excuse it, but it does help explain it."
647,2021-02-23 14:00:51+00:00,Matt_Hougan,The takeaway from Tether should be that the traditional banking industry's refusal to provide services to the crypto industry in the mid-2010s put people at serious risk.

655,2021-02-17 14:48:07+00:00,Matt_Hougan,@etfAction @NateGeraci @philbak1 You can settle a crypto transaction nearly instantly and very cheaply in part because you bear that risk.
656,2021-02-17 14:47:34+00:00,Matt_Hougan,@etfAction @NateGeraci @philbak1 Crypto is cheaper/faster/more efficient than legacy financial systems in part because the burden of accuracy and loss is shifted from banks to the individual.

The difference to me is the primary efficiency and open nature of decentralized approaches."
661,2021-02-17 14:39:09+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"@etfAction @NateGeraci @philbak1 You always need a process to maintain the state and security of records of financial transactions. In traditional finance, that's banks and other participants; in crypto, it's software (PoW or another consensus mechanism, governance token holders, etc.)."
662,2021-02-17 14:30:10+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"@etfAction @NateGeraci @philbak1 Well, kind of. In the way that ATMs ""just"" replaced bank tellers.

Among the differences: DeFi works 24/7/365, is open to everyone, can be programmed by software, improves over time, has 100x faster settlement. Also, software doesn't need a bonus to buy a house in the Hamptons."

768,2020-10-07 00:22:01+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"@zhascoe @APompliano @BVBTC @Sonnenshein @CraigSalm #2 is pretty complex. You'd have to hard fork the blockchain and create a new mining glidepath or one-off distribution. Most likely, even if a majority supported the higher limit, some would stick with the original version. You'd end up with ""bitcoin"" and ""bitcoin classic."""
769,2020-10-07 00:20:31+00:00,Matt_Hougan,@zhascoe @APompliano @BVBTC @Sonnenshein @CraigSalm The answer to 1 is economic self-interest + social consensus. The only way the max number of bitcoin could be changed is if most of the nodes running the Bitcoin blockchain adopted a new version of the software with a higher limit. They're disincented b/c it would lower the value

I'm a digital optimist: If a problem is transparently solvable by software, and if it represents a real business opportunity, someone will solve it. Usually sooner rather than later."
876,2019-10-17 19:15:10+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"@DaveNadig Agreed. 

The flip side: How absurd is it that we're still talking about fractional shares as a breakthrough! Computers have handled fractions for a long time. 

Two other absurdities: 1) Stocks trade 6.5 hours a day, 5 days/week; 2) Stocks take 2 days to settle."
877,2019-10-17 18:31:31+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"Great to see @CharlesSchwab announce plans to support fractional shares. Inevitable, but still good to see. IMHO, the combination of zero commissions and fractional shares makes direct indexing an inevitability for equities.

941,2019-05-27 16:47:15+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"@fintechfrank @bitwise @teddyfuse @HHorsley It has a modest impact on argument #3, because it takes the spot ADV from $544m to $622m. Meanwhile, the futures volume is still $268m. So, without gray volume, the futures market was 49% the size of the spot market; with the gray volume, it‚Äôs 43%."

947,2019-05-13 20:47:05+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"This is significant: CME bitcoin futures volume in the past 24-hours is $1.2 billion, a new record, and 2X the size of the largest spot bitcoin exchange (Binance, $600m). Futures are an increasingly important part of this market.  https://t.co/ucf7p2LuW5 https://t.co/ocWZewd7tW"
948,2019-05-10 17:50:45+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"There's been a notable shift from BTC-USDT to BTC-fiat volume since the NYAG's court order re: USDT. On April 23, USDT exchanges made up 54.0% of real bitcoin volume; today, that number is 46.5%. Kraken, Bitstamp and Coinbase are the primary beneficiaries https://t.co/8luckTr0s8"

950,2019-04-25 20:20:12+00:00,Matt_Hougan,Very excited about this! Dorsey Wright has been at the forefront of advisor education for decades. Seeing them embrace crypto data is one more step in the mainstreaming of crypto in the advisor space.

954,2019-04-10 18:09:40+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"@nategeraci Comments like Gellasch‚Äôs drive me nuts. If you worry about ETFs trading to a discount at times of stress, you must have an equal or larger worry about mutual funds subsidizing exiting investors on the backs of buy and hold investors at those times.  They are logically equivalent."
955,2019-04-05 16:31:47+00:00,Matt_Hougan,Very excited to speak at the world's leading crypto conference. Consensus 2019 is a can't miss event.

Really impressed. https://t.co/lGKxtNniLm"
957,2019-03-30 15:17:30+00:00,Matt_Hougan,Great thoughts here from @zachmider.
958,2019-03-29 21:18:34+00:00,Matt_Hougan,A nice interview with Robert England for @BreakerMag about our bitcoin trading analysis. https://t.co/LSCp0uC2Cm
959,2019-03-29 18:07:56+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"@ElisabethKashne @ElisabethKashne -- I agree that heartbeat flows should be looked at, and think both your and @zachmider et al. did great work on this. I'm just saying that I don't want and you don't need to lose the benefits of in-kind creations and redemptions for normal investor flows."
960,2019-03-29 17:06:19+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"But let's be careful not to throw the baby out with the bathwater. The so-called ""ETF tax edge"" is actually just a fairer way to handle tax. Let's resist the temptation to look back fondly on an antiquated system that, in reality, unfairly punishes long-term investors. (16/16)"
961,2019-03-29 17:06:18+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"I think it's totally reasonable to look at heartbeat trades and see if they are in line with both the spirit and the letter of the tax law, and I'm glad to see this article out there. (15/16)"
962,2019-03-29 17:06:17+00:00,Matt_Hougan,Or how ETFs use in-kind creations and redemptions to lower transaction costs inside the fund for the betterment of shareholders. (14/16)
963,2019-03-29 17:06:16+00:00,Matt_Hougan,That's not to mention the fundamental (and I think real) risk that exists in high yield corporate bond mutual funds that promise cash redemptions at theoretical NAVs that don't hold up in times of crisis (see Third Avenue). (13/16)
964,2019-03-29 17:06:15+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"I honestly think that if mutual funds didn't exist and someone tried to propose them today they would be laughed out of the room. ""Hey I have this great new structure: You have to pay tax if other people in the fund sell.""  Really? (12/16)"
965,2019-03-29 17:06:14+00:00,Matt_Hougan,Put another way: The tax treatment in traditional mutual funds penalizes long-term investors to the benefit of short-term speculators. It is fundamentally unfair and just plain wrong. (11/16)
966,2019-03-29 17:06:13+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"It means that, as an investor in an ETF, I only pay tax when I sell the fund. I don't pay taxes because you wanted to put your toes in the sand and drink pina coladas. (10/16)"
967,2019-03-29 17:06:12+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"If a lot of investors want to sell an ETF, an Authorized Participant may redeem shares. If they do, the ETF still doesn't sell anything, because it can redeem in-kind as the article suggests. But rather than being nefarious, this is the only rational way it should work. (9/16)"
968,2019-03-29 17:06:12+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"In an ETF, when you decide to sell, you just sell your shares on the open market to another investor. The fund doesn't have to buy or sell anything to give you your cash, and I am not impacted at all. The only one who pays taxes is you, if the ETF has appreciated in value. (8/16)"
969,2019-03-29 17:06:11+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"In other words, I pay taxes because you wanted to go on vacation. This is insane (7/16)."
970,2019-03-29 17:06:10+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"At the end of the year, the fund will pay out those capital gains -- not to you, because you left the fund, but to me and all the other long-term, buy-and-hold investors who are still invested. (6/16)"
971,2019-03-29 17:06:09+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"Mutual funds redeem in cash. That means when you sell your shares, the fund has to sell stocks out of its portfolio to raise cash to pay you. If those stocks have appreciated in value, the fund realizes capital gains. (5/16)"
972,2019-03-29 17:06:08+00:00,Matt_Hougan,Let's imagine that you and I both own shares in a traditional mutual fund. You decide to sell because you want to go on vacation in the Bahamas. I stay invested because I'm saving money for a down payment on a house. (4/16)
973,2019-03-29 17:06:07+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"But of course, ""ETFs entire tax edge"" does not come from this edge case but rather from how ETFs handle regular investor inflows and outflows -- a process  that is inherently more fair and pro-investor than how it works with traditional mutual funds. (3/16)"
974,2019-03-29 17:06:06+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"The article talks about so-called ""heartbeat trades"" but ponders Congress ""closing the loophole"" and ""ending not just heartbeats but ETFs' entire tax edge."" (2/16)"
975,2019-03-29 17:06:05+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"This article from @zachmider is well-written and builds on fantastic research by @ElisabethKashne, but it over-reaches in an important and potentially dangerous way when it tries to extend this edge-case example to the core of the creation/redemption mechanism. (1/16)"
976,2019-03-28 17:52:35+00:00,Matt_Hougan,Fun to connect with @IOHK_Charles on the floor of the NYSE. https://t.co/zkHRaPJShs

978,2019-03-26 23:28:55+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"@FollowTheChain @BitwiseInvest For sure, @FollowTheChain. Note: While most of the volume is concentrated in the 0-2 bitcoin range, if you zoom in on the Trade Volume Histogram, you can see the classic behavioral patterns of greater-than-random amounts of whole bitcoin trading in the 2-10 bitcoin range as well. https://t.co/e2R6Fc9flQ"
979,2019-03-23 00:51:46+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"@nanxi_liu @BitwiseInvest Nanxi - Great point. Korean exchanges were excluded from our analysis because, due to capital controls, they operate as an isolated market. Unlike with other markets, arbitrage between Korean exchanges and the globally integrated price is difficult and/or impossible."
980,2019-03-22 20:31:10+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"@SystematicAlpha SA: Yes, that was a mistake that popped up late in the copy-editing process. You're absolutely right: The hashes should be different."
981,2019-03-22 15:47:43+00:00,Matt_Hougan,Here's the full tweet storm of our research findings on the true nature of the bitcoin market.
982,2019-03-22 13:58:09+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"@fintechfrank @paulvigna @WSJ @BitwiseInvest @HHorsley Second, there are lots of ETFs on the market with significantly lower ADV than we've revealed to be the real bitcoin volume.  Consider this chart, which was submitted as a comment letter to the original Winkelvoss filing. The market is plenty big without the nonsense. https://t.co/9znhh6BY3Y"
983,2019-03-22 13:55:33+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"@fintechfrank @paulvigna @WSJ @BitwiseInvest @HHorsley Great question Frank. Two points.  First, the real bitcoin volume ($270m) is quite healthy considering its market cap ... roughly in line with gold.  The strange situation was imaging all of bitcoin turnover over every two weeks. https://t.co/U0ganCnxQB"
984,2019-03-06 20:31:19+00:00,Matt_Hougan,@_andrewkillen @ToddCFRA @EricBalchunas @mbarna6 @InsideETFs I'd call it a very modest effect :) ESPO did have its largest flow day ever (first multiple creation day I think) immediately after the event. I still think this will be a $100m+ fund by year-end. https://t.co/1bOo1TKhn1
985,2019-02-27 23:23:25+00:00,Matt_Hougan,I'm really proud of the team here @BitwiseInvest for creating this tool for advisors.  It helps demystify the impact crypto can have on a portfolio.
986,2019-02-26 16:19:56+00:00,Matt_Hougan,A really important insight from @MstarETFUS on the Vanguard fee cut...
987,2019-02-25 20:04:21+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"Great article (https://t.co/nSwiHOBrZj).  But on't forget Old Mutual, which launched zero-fee ETFs with a fee waiver in 2009! https://t.co/HWXb9OReD2"
988,2019-02-25 20:00:14+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"@AbacusJournal @gaborgurbacs @RobinhoodApp I agree that explicit fees are better of course. And I used to be confident people did too. But I wonder if things are changing in the Facebook era. See: Robinhood, Schwab Intelligent Portfolios, etc."
989,2019-02-25 16:03:40+00:00,Matt_Hougan,Why do we assume zero is the bottom?
990,2019-02-24 18:26:01+00:00,Matt_Hougan,@norcap @ThinkAdvisor @DaveNadig @InsideETFs The next two big frontiers in improving investor returns are narrowing the behavior gap and rationalizing advisor fees.
991,2019-02-24 18:23:36+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"@norcap @ThinkAdvisor @DaveNadig @InsideETFs I think highly personalized portfolios -- run by software and constrained by high-quality optimizers to minimize tracking risk -- will encourage better investor behavior. (2 of 2, I guess, but one more coming :) )."
992,2019-02-24 18:21:59+00:00,Matt_Hougan,@norcap @ThinkAdvisor @DaveNadig @InsideETFs I could not disagree more. As wonderful as the fee wars and rise of passive have been -- and I've been among the biggest cheerleaders and chroniclers -- we've made shockingly little progress in recent years narrowing the DALBAR/Morningstar Investor Return gap.  (1 or 2)
993,2019-02-24 15:02:13+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"@gaborgurbacs @nikhileshde I couldn‚Äôt agree more, Gabor.  People outside the industry don‚Äôt realize the degree to which that is true.:."
994,2019-02-23 23:52:58+00:00,Matt_Hougan,This is so great.
995,2019-02-22 22:05:15+00:00,Matt_Hougan,@Hector_McNeil Agreed!  Very bullish on European ETF growth!
996,2019-02-22 17:50:40+00:00,Matt_Hougan,I still think people underappreciate the extent to which the active mutual fund industry has been destroyed.  What other industry has thousands and thousands of highly paid salespeople and massive advertising budgets ... and eleven years of net negative sales? Incredible.
997,2019-02-22 15:02:20+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"And of course, as @DaveNadig and I said at @InsideETFs, I think the next huge opportunity lies in direct indexing, and there are many $1b (and potentially much larger) businesses to built there in the coming years."
998,2019-02-22 15:01:19+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"For better or worse, I also think advisors will spend more time thinking about and talking with clients about their liquidity budgets in coming years, and we'll see rising allocations to illiquid assets in client accounts as expectations for future equity returns decline."
999,2019-02-22 14:56:08+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"That said, there are still a number of potential $1b+ gaps in the ETF lineup, including:

1) Crypto (obviously)
2) Bonds (massively underdeveloped, both in terms of use and products)
3) Option overlays (look at the success of Swan or 50/50 strategies in Canada)
4) ESG (obviously)"
1000,2019-02-22 14:48:25+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"Amazing article from @ElisabethKashne on the difficulty of launching a successful new ETF. One factor that could be contributing to the increased closure rate is the pervasiveness of the fee war, which has likely made the implied AUM hurdle for ""success"" higher."
1001,2019-02-22 14:41:23+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"Great data from @avichal. IMHO, long-term, crypto's correlation to other assets should be low, as the fundamental drivers of return are completely different. But short-term, crypto is a risk asset for most people, and can suffer in risk-off periods like we saw in December."
1002,2019-02-22 14:35:39+00:00,Matt_Hougan,"@JonSBeckett @RobinJPowell @DaveNadig @Think_JanetL @ThinkAdvisor Agreed! The flipside is that the realized returns for direct indexing portfolios should be better than fund-driven portfolios. Designed and presented well, DI portfolios should feel deeply personal and long-term, which should cut-down on reactionary buy-high/sell-low trading."
1003,2019-02-21 18:14:33+00:00,Matt_Hougan,Peak life moment: @EricBalchunas just called me the Tom Brady of ETF analyst battles on the Bloomberg Trillions podcast. (It's a great episode if you want a summary of what happened @InsideETFs.)  https://t.co/UsNIE5OOPu
