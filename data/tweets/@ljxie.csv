167,2022-09-22 07:39:16+00:00,ljxie,@nigelwtlee To me it‚Äôs about building up different and more accessible ways of gaining this reputation. For example in many DAOs anyone is allowed to contribute and prove their work whereas you can‚Äôt just gain that contributor reputation from being rich
168,2022-09-22 07:35:16+00:00,ljxie,"@0xak_ Oh yes this would include off chain data. Even with DAO contributions there‚Äôs plenty of off chain behavior that is more useful to factor in than on chain activity (e.g. work contributed, Snapshot voting)"
169,2022-09-22 07:29:06+00:00,ljxie,"@photon0x Genuinely curious why?

I‚Äôm expecting there to be financial collateral still but the ratios can potentially be undercollateralized with enough reputation at stake (even if someone else vouching) and more lenient for smaller loans. Obviously all varies based on circumstances"

175,2022-09-17 08:22:53+00:00,ljxie,Honestly one of the best parts about working in crypto is how there is always something interesting happening each day whether it‚Äôs an exciting technological innovation or crazy news story. It‚Äôs impossible to be bored in this space

189,2022-09-13 19:14:28+00:00,ljxie,@derek_hsue Also depends on DAO structure and processes though e.g. with Gitcoin DAO we have moved towards a lot of offchain consensus from delegates through forums and calls before a vote even makes it to Snapshot.

205,2022-09-01 18:19:14+00:00,ljxie,@mohakagr I'm sure someone can always find a reason why it's not _zero_ but generally yes there have been plenty of examples where it's pretty reasonable that there isn't a conflict of interest that is concerning
206,2022-09-01 18:11:42+00:00,ljxie,So far as a delegate I've been abstaining from all votes where there is a potential conflict of interest but have also heard from others that this ends up disenfranchising those that delegated esp since liquid delegation isn't really possible / can be cost prohibitive on-chain

247,2022-07-13 01:47:23+00:00,ljxie,Interesting situation in @OptimismGov where a project received a large allocation of tokens from the governance fund and self-delegated it which made them the largest delegate and shifted voting power significantly.

474,2022-03-20 16:33:17+00:00,ljxie,@0xGioMedici Why does paying for someone‚Äôs work automatically lead to being controlled by bribes though? Politicians and government officials still get paid to be able to support themselves/their family
475,2022-03-20 16:30:27+00:00,ljxie,"@ntkris Yes, I was worried about the dynamic too but it could just be a flat rate for being active in a term. Gitcoin DAO currently experimenting with this https://t.co/pSzFzx84Re"

478,2022-03-20 05:25:24+00:00,ljxie,Is there an existing working group for core members / top delegates of different major DAOs? Would love to share best practices so we aren‚Äôt all repeating the same mistakes. It‚Äôs so early on with DAOs that there‚Äôs a lot of opportunity to help each other get past some pain points
479,2022-03-20 05:16:14+00:00,ljxie,@_jefflau We‚Äôre just starting to experiment with this at Gitcoin DAO thanks to @Sim_Pop but I like this concept so far of a pool of tokens allocated to top delegates that are active for a term https://t.co/pSzFzx84Re
480,2022-03-20 05:07:40+00:00,ljxie,I think it should be the norm for major DAO delegates to be paid for their time from the treasury if proven to be active/engaged. It can be a significant amount of work and add up in gas fees. Many delegates pay out of pocket and there shouldn‚Äôt be a cost barrier to participating

1166,2021-08-03 15:58:10+00:00,ljxie,"@Kaprekar_Punk @KyleSamani I'm also realizing through this thread that there's a lot of negative connotation with the term ""social signaling"" but I don't view it as all bad and in some cases great / useful so perhaps there's a better word for how I'm viewing it https://t.co/5BALhKLXVA"
1167,2021-08-03 15:47:08+00:00,ljxie,"@Kaprekar_Punk @KyleSamani I think that's really cool, thank you for sharing!"
1168,2021-08-03 15:33:49+00:00,ljxie,"@kieran_eth @androolloyd @aqxu I don't think it's as black-and-white as you're implying. What people own can sometimes signal to others on what they do / care about which can start conversations, make friendships, etc. Of course, there's also the other end of the spectrum that can be unhealthy"
1169,2021-08-03 15:17:44+00:00,ljxie,@androolloyd @aqxu IMO not all social signaling is bad. It's natural human behavior to care about belonging and people signal which communities they are part of. Lots of examples in this book https://t.co/j17479OFeE
1170,2021-08-03 15:10:43+00:00,ljxie,"@yzchaos @KyleSamani What about renting limos for prom, parties, etc? I don't think everyone assumes that the person/group actually owns the limo"
1171,2021-08-03 15:04:00+00:00,ljxie,"@StaniKulechov @KyleSamani Agreed!

Not exactly the same but I rent dresses from Rent the Runway for formal events and when people ask where I got it I say Rent the Runway and people think it's cool. No shame in renting IMO"
1172,2021-08-03 15:01:16+00:00,ljxie,@KyleSamani Private markets for renting NFTs (past just CryptoPunks) can and will likely eventually exist on-chain if that's the main sticking point
1173,2021-08-03 14:44:47+00:00,ljxie,@androolloyd @aqxu Oh I completely agree with you that I care more about long term ownership but I still think that social signaling is going to drive a significant amount especially as the space grows much larger
1174,2021-08-03 14:39:34+00:00,ljxie,@KyleSamani Genuine question how is this much different than people renting luxury clothes / goods for social signaling instead of buying a cheap knock-off? There's even a market for people renting grounded private jets to take Instagram pics. A lot of people care about signaling
1175,2021-08-03 14:35:35+00:00,ljxie,@Shman_Dee And some people rent Rolexes. There's definitely a market for that
1176,2021-08-03 14:34:24+00:00,ljxie,@androolloyd @aqxu I agree fractionalization will happen a lot more but also think both will happen https://t.co/ooTv6AYYTU
1177,2021-08-03 07:23:47+00:00,ljxie,@TheCryptoDog Yep
1178,2021-08-03 07:11:23+00:00,ljxie,@mewn21 Oh I'm happy to discuss with you! It's a very interesting topic. I guess I just feel very strongly that people will go to great lengths for social signaling both online and in-person and so rental markets will exist for all kinds of things in relation to this we wouldn't expect
1179,2021-08-03 06:58:16+00:00,ljxie,@aqxu I don't think this is going to be a huge market or anything but I definitely think there will be a larger trend where people are renting NFTs as social signaling with CryptoPunk rentals being one of the earlier use cases ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1180,2021-08-03 06:44:04+00:00,ljxie,"I haven't had this much controversy from a tweet in a while üôÉ

Many people are now buying a CryptoPunk in part to use as their pfp for social signaling. They chose not to copy the image. Some people want to do the same but can't afford it. So I think a rental market will exist"
1181,2021-08-03 06:15:45+00:00,ljxie,@markusjayvc @DeezeFi I think that's really cool! Some owners might not want to fractionalize their CryptoPunk or some people will want their avatars to stand out a little more so think both will exist!
1182,2021-08-03 06:12:02+00:00,ljxie,"@coinasaurus Not the same thing given the context. It's all socially enforced if you're using someone else's CryptoPunk as your profile pic, the owner might say something. Some people don't want that to happen. Not saying everyone cares but I believe an NFT rental market like this will exist"
1183,2021-08-03 05:50:46+00:00,ljxie,More people are going to start renting CryptoPunks to display as their profile pic for social signaling. Found out https://t.co/H7EGFsKg8J exists where owners can sign a transaction giving the borrower rights to display the CryptoPunk as their avatar for a fixed number of days https://t.co/FacnYN7Gcb

1210,2021-07-24 04:40:11+00:00,ljxie,@aptsousa @ameensol Could vary a lot based on what the agreement is but one option would be crypto is held in a smart contract and the bond would be slashed if there is military action

1400,2021-06-02 15:28:39+00:00,ljxie,@DeFiTeddy2020 @arcxmoney @kermankohli That's definitely a risk and up to protocols to decide collateralization requirements. It doesn't have to be under collateralized but could be more favorable e.g. a little over 100%. The goal is that the DeFi Passport will provide enough value that it's a huge cost to destroy it

1402,2021-06-01 23:40:27+00:00,ljxie,@hudsonjameson Great thread! I also voted for the proposal by @HelloShreyas @llamacommunity_.

1403,2021-06-01 21:56:45+00:00,ljxie,"@punk4464 @kermankohli @arcxmoney Depends! Some examples: if it's for better collateralization ratios then liquidity isn't fungible since some users will be riskier than others, if a protocol is looking to distribute gov tokens then it would be helpful to know who are the more active / longer-term users to reward"

1744,2021-01-16 05:43:20+00:00,ljxie,Had a few ask about recommended resources for better understanding crypto and I've been pointing to a16z crypto canon as a wonderful resource to start with https://t.co/epNSB9Puhg
1745,2021-01-16 05:43:20+00:00,ljxie,Been getting questions on how to get immersed in the dev community and I've been recommending trying out hackathons like ETHGlobal. Great place to meet devs and interesting projects as well as learn more about tooling/ecosystem

1748,2021-01-16 05:43:20+00:00,ljxie,"So far got a ton of interest including software engineers at Google, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft who spend a lot of their spare time on crypto but just haven't made the move yet. Makes me even more optimistic about crypto :)"

2021,2020-10-17 15:35:55+00:00,ljxie,"@ecurrencyhodler Yep, was more relevant for us since in addition to early-stage token investing, we also invest in liquid tokens that are highly volatile in price so the management fee becomes less predictable"

2037,2020-10-16 16:46:16+00:00,ljxie,"@ApuContrarian Correct, very common for crypto funds"
2038,2020-10-16 06:16:49+00:00,ljxie,@NTmoney Interesting way for employees to get liquidity in the event that the company doesn't IPO by then. Betting no is almost like a liquidity hedge
2039,2020-10-16 05:49:46+00:00,ljxie,9/ We chose a hedge fund structure for the flexibility as we invest in tokens/participate in networks. Both HF and VC structure have its pros and cons. VC structure is easier for filtering for long term focused LPs but a HF structure can also do the same if you have long lockups
2040,2020-10-16 05:49:46+00:00,ljxie,"8/ We're structured as a hedge fund with a long-term view so this part may vary depending on the structure but it's also quite a bit of operating work to get set up as well. Key ones for us were making sure to have legal, banking partner, fund admin, audit, tax, custody"
2041,2020-10-16 05:49:46+00:00,ljxie,7/ I was really glad we raised money for the management company (pays operating costs) so that we had a buffer in case there was a bear market in crypto and the management fee wasn't enough. My ultimate goal was to make sure the fund lasted until crypto inevitably became massive
2042,2020-10-16 05:49:46+00:00,ljxie,"6/ I love getting to work with my LPs but there was a very small handful that I wish I had vetted better. It is only the very few that create the most work and as a small fund, we didn't really have that much capacity to handle tons of ad-hoc requests/meetings"
2043,2020-10-16 05:49:45+00:00,ljxie,"5/ I had to deal with some sexism. I've had people comment on my appearance, ask to speak to the person in charge, attribute my ""success"" in crypto to my husband. But the vast majority of people treated me with respect and it's a hard no on taking capital from people who don't"
2044,2020-10-16 05:49:45+00:00,ljxie,"4/ The process itself though was exhausting. There were many meetings where it's clear the person/fund had no intention of investing but wanted to just pick your brain for research of their own. It took me too long to realize that. Be protective of your time, it's okay to say no"
2045,2020-10-16 05:49:45+00:00,ljxie,3/ I wish I had spoken with more fund managers when I was first starting to better understand what the early experience was like. It's a lot more meetings specifically fundraising meetings than I expected. I met so many wonderful LPs and others through this process
2046,2020-10-16 05:49:44+00:00,ljxie,2/ My day to day at the fund now is really exciting. I get to spend the vast majority of my time on research and talking to interesting builders/investors in crypto. It's what I had envisioned from the start and why I left Coinbase to do this but it took a while to get there
2047,2020-10-16 05:49:44+00:00,ljxie,"1/ One of the topics I get asked a lot about is my experience starting a fund (crypto), often in the context of someone who hasn't been in VC before and/or as a female fund manager. I find myself repeating a lot of the same learnings/experiences so figured I would share some here"

2227,2020-09-08 23:14:59+00:00,ljxie,@koeppelmann @mayazi I'm not saying they can't assess risk. The risk is undeniably there and I am just saying it needs to be managed properly to ensure there is enough runway. I don't think most projects are suggesting users put a significant amount of their own life savings into contracts either
2228,2020-09-08 22:57:43+00:00,ljxie,"@mayazi That said, I personally wouldn't recommend any crypto projects to put a significant amount of their funds into a smart contract because there is still risk. Making sure you have enough runway to build is far more important"
2229,2020-09-08 22:53:13+00:00,ljxie,@mayazi Depends on the yield farming activity. Some are very risky and IMO isn't worth risking runway for (similar to projects investing treasury) while other activities like staking/lending in an audited + fairly battle-tested contract are lower risk and look more like earning interest

2297,2020-08-22 04:38:10+00:00,ljxie,"tl;dr

DeFi governance tokens distributed to community, often reward adding liquidity (liquidity mining). Ppl switch among projects to earn highest rewards (yield farming). YFI token launched w/o investor or team allocation (fair launch). Many copycats. High usage = high ETH fees"

2377,2020-08-10 07:21:29+00:00,ljxie,@antiprosynth I‚Äôm not referring to just the app layer. Ethereum community is far more open to changing significant aspects of the core protocol which always leaves more room for potential issues.

2378,2020-08-10 07:16:18+00:00,ljxie,@antiprosynth I personally don‚Äôt want my digital gold to be doing all kinds of experiments. Keeping it simple and less prone to attacks/issues is a very good thing and will make traditional investors searching for a hedge feel more comfortable. But Ethereum can capture so many other use cases
2379,2020-08-10 07:06:44+00:00,ljxie,"Still don‚Äôt get the Bitcoin vs Ethereum debates. Bitcoin acts as a better digital gold.

2416,2020-08-05 05:12:43+00:00,ljxie,Another feature is a leaderboard that keeps track of who has contributed the most to the chat group. You could imagine token rewards distributed to those with the highest amounts of participation. Obviously someone could spam this but those participants would just get kicked out
2417,2020-08-05 05:12:43+00:00,ljxie,I think what @Collab_Land_ is doing for community management is really interesting. One feature is a Telegram bot that can connect to your Ethereum wallet to verify token balance before joining a chat group. It could help filter out noise from those without skin in the game

2740,2020-06-07 06:37:16+00:00,ljxie,"@anothercohen From this thread, it sounds like some people have already been doing that!"
2741,2020-06-07 06:32:27+00:00,ljxie,"@sam_kirschner @nealkhosla Possible, but part of why I joined crypto was the efficiency of it compared to legacy systems so hoping that someone tries to make it happen without the extra steps + fees :)"
2742,2020-06-07 06:24:38+00:00,ljxie,@sam_kirschner @nealkhosla I was actually looking into buying secondaries in SpaceX but I'm not very liquid right now which is what prompted the tweet of using some equity to trade
2743,2020-06-07 06:20:25+00:00,ljxie,@LawxTechxArt @lex_node Yep! Was just sharing most recent example I came across
2744,2020-06-07 06:19:37+00:00,ljxie,@unpopularvc It would be opt-in trade between 2 individuals so there's no pool that you would have to receive from. I think you'd be surprised by the # of employees at successful companies that would do this because they want exposure to other areas/industries https://t.co/rdmtWvs3Fd
2745,2020-06-07 06:11:23+00:00,ljxie,@nealkhosla @sam_kirschner I don't see that as much different than employees using some of their money to angel invest in startups. Some of that equity could end up being worth a lot even though they don't work there. This just provides a mechanism for people to sort of invest without having a lot of cash
2746,2020-06-07 05:56:56+00:00,ljxie,"@lex_node I think a lot of promising crypto startups at least are very open to things like this.

Agreed regarding keeping cap tables simple but genuinely curious how this is much different than services providing some liquidity for employees e.g. https://t.co/GR9jqBVuiL"

2749,2020-06-07 02:18:47+00:00,ljxie,@apolloslater @jillruthcarlson I think it could make sense for a small %. Similar to allowing employees to sell a small % in a tender offer
2750,2020-06-07 02:15:17+00:00,ljxie,@JTremback I think the swap would make more sense for employees. I love Coinbase and think they will be enormously successful but I would love to swap a small % of it with friends that work at awesome companies like Figma and SpaceX
2751,2020-06-07 02:01:01+00:00,ljxie,"@tarunchitra @coinbase IMO a ""what is"" post should be a lot simpler than a guide. The one I wrote tried to explain a lot of different systems in DeFi to people already familiar with Ethereum/smart contracts.

2752,2020-06-07 00:47:03+00:00,ljxie,It'd be neat if there was a way for employees at different startups to be able to swap a small % of their equity with each other. It would help each de-risk a little and build a small portfolio of startups they believe in.

3220,2020-02-05 04:50:25+00:00,ljxie,Therapy has been amazingly helpful in my life. A few things I wish I'd known earlier: 1) It can be affordable since many insurance plans cover it (w/ co-pay) 2) Some do remote sessions which is great if you travel a lot 3) Try to meet w/ several to see who you click with the most

3223,2020-02-04 18:10:42+00:00,ljxie,@cyber_hokie There's always areas for improvement which is why I'm calling these experimental DAOs
3224,2020-02-04 18:04:33+00:00,ljxie,@cyber_hokie Signal DAO uses a Telegram bot for coordination so it doesn't have those specific issues https://t.co/NaaQ8Ese8u
3225,2020-02-04 17:47:52+00:00,ljxie,"@cyber_hokie IMO no different than people using other forms of communication to coordinate e.g. Slack, GitHub, Twitter"
3226,2020-02-04 17:43:35+00:00,ljxie,"@_TomHoward @SignalDAO SignalDAO is one of the DAOs I'm referring to. I know this is going to change but for now, 1 hour voting windows are rough üòÖ"
3227,2020-02-04 08:44:49+00:00,ljxie,@bolbo_id Completely agree. What's really neat is experiments happens so quickly in this industry that I think the standards will emerge a lot quicker than what we see in traditional models
3228,2020-02-04 08:43:22+00:00,ljxie,@chrisamccoy @cryptow1re @store_labs Interesting that every company &amp; org would get a single vote too. I haven't thought about this concept much but wouldn't this incentivize people to start more companies &amp; orgs to get more vote count? Happy to talk about this outside of Twitter since it could be a nuanced convo
3229,2020-02-04 08:35:21+00:00,ljxie,"@bolbo_id Compared to traditional companies, DAOs are much easier/cheaper to set up, allow for easier global participation, any member can vote so it's not just those at the top, members don't have to be full-time so they can be in multiple DAOs vs commit to one company"
3230,2020-02-04 08:33:38+00:00,ljxie,"@bolbo_id I think these were too quick since not everyone has the chance to vote in that time period e.g. diff time zones, work, etc. If they're decisions that don't have much at stake then quick voting seems reasonable."
3231,2020-02-04 08:28:40+00:00,ljxie,@cryptow1re @store_labs I think it is realistic for smaller-scale DAOs that are designed for a specific goal which is the case for these 2 DAOs
3232,2020-02-04 07:56:16+00:00,ljxie,Random crypto observation: The 2 experimental DAOs I'm in coordinate votes on Telegram. The voting happens so quickly (within hours or sometimes &lt;1 hour) that I can't even keep up. It's only 2 DAOs as a reference but I'm surprised by how quickly decisions are getting made.
3233,2020-02-04 07:33:52+00:00,ljxie,@SignalDAO Curious as to why the voting period is restricted to one hour?

3293,2020-01-14 01:37:41+00:00,ljxie,@JonPSpitz Worked at it slowly in order of what I thought had the highest impact. The first was deleting my Facebook and Instagram accounts.

3921,2019-08-05 23:14:44+00:00,ljxie,"@alchemyDC @socrates1024 Yes, I agree. Should have included that point in my thread."
3922,2019-08-05 23:04:46+00:00,ljxie,@AeonCoin @socrates1024 Agree that there will always be a form of unpredictability but in Placeholder's proposal it is price volatility risk and in this case it would be price volatility risk + unpredictability around allocations w/ possibility that none or very little gets directed to funding.

3925,2019-08-05 22:32:49+00:00,ljxie,So far the proposal that resonates with me the most is Placeholder's by @cburniske. I like the split of funds between protocol dev &amp; growth.

However collateralization ratio and what assets can be used as collateral matter but I feel a lot of the prominent DeFi protocols have a solid system in place. There is always smart contract risk though.

3999,2019-07-22 20:51:29+00:00,ljxie,One of my favorite aspects of DeFi is people can earn interest directly with their own money. That same capital could have been fiat in a bank account where the bank loans it out &amp; takes vast majority of that interest. Hold your own money &amp; you can earn more. It's pretty amazing.

4011,2019-07-20 01:09:47+00:00,ljxie,3/ Cons include difficult/inconsistent to measure reputation. Influential people who don‚Äôt like the project can vote maliciously (add a min stake).

4012,2019-07-20 01:09:46+00:00,ljxie,2/ Pros include allowing smaller token holders to have a slight multiplier on their vote if they have a strong reputation so it‚Äôs not just whales that decide everything or even whales that buy up everything last minute before a vote.

4025,2019-07-19 03:58:11+00:00,ljxie,"1/ There's debate whether privacy will be a feature in cryptocurrencies or there will be need for privacy coins. My answer is both.

4378,2019-04-16 18:37:24+00:00,ljxie,8/ Both projects have decentralized governance. DOT holders are even able to vote on adding/removing parachains (there‚Äôs a finite number of parachains) which is concerning but some have said it is also not in DOT holder‚Äôs financial interest to be arbitrarily voting off chains.
4379,2019-04-16 18:37:24+00:00,ljxie,7/ Cosmos takes a different approach where each chain has its own validators but can request to join a hub for pooled security purposes such as Cosmos Hub. There‚Äôs a strong principle on the ability to be sovereign in Cosmos.
4380,2019-04-16 18:37:24+00:00,ljxie,6/ Polkadot‚Äôs relay chain pools security for all of the other chains. This means that new chains don‚Äôt have to spin up their own consensus and can outsource security to Polkadot. Another benefit is the chains can all easily communicate with each other.
4381,2019-04-16 18:37:24+00:00,ljxie,5/ Some chains aren‚Äôt default interoperable with these systems so they each have a mechanism that allows you to still make them interoperable. In Cosmos they are called peg zones and in Polkadot they are called bridge chains.
4382,2019-04-16 18:37:24+00:00,ljxie,4/ The Cosmos token ATOM is used specifically for staking in one of the hubs called the Cosmos Hub (recently launched) while Polkadot's token DOT is used for staking in the relay chain (not launched yet).
4383,2019-04-16 18:37:24+00:00,ljxie,3/ In Polkadot there is one main chain (relay chain) with other chains connected to it (parachains). In Cosmos there‚Äôs multiple ‚Äúmain‚Äù chains (hubs) which anyone can build and other chains (zones) can choose which hub to request to join (only if they want to join).
4384,2019-04-16 18:37:24+00:00,ljxie,2/ Both projects aim to enable interoperability among different blockchains. The concepts both involve hub and spoke type models where a hub is validating for their spokes (different blockchains).

4430,2019-03-28 00:11:12+00:00,ljxie,4/ Vemo has been working with Purdue University to offer ISAs to students. The ISA cohorts didn‚Äôt have any adverse selection. UCSD Extension is launching their ISA program in July. They are partnering with San Diego Workforce Partnership to provide additional career services
4431,2019-03-28 00:11:12+00:00,ljxie,"3/ There‚Äôs been a lot of people thinking about this for decades so why now? Some of the points from @lessin were the world is increasingly connected, there‚Äôs more data available, major increase in student debt &amp; the 2008 financial crisis led to more concern about taking on debt"
4432,2019-03-28 00:11:11+00:00,ljxie,2/ A major use case is to offer an alternative to students taking on debt for education &amp; provide access to those who wouldn‚Äôt have otherwise. Many attend college w/ the goal of getting a job. ISAs can align incentives so schools will only get paid if the student gets a job
4433,2019-03-28 00:11:10+00:00,ljxie,1/ I attended a fascinating conference hosted by @lessin @eriktorenberg around ISAs (income share agreements).

4450,2019-03-21 22:50:20+00:00,ljxie,"4/ The work on shards is split into 2 phases and the spec is still in flux. Phase 1 is about coming to consensus on the *data* of the shards. The beacon chain randomly selects a set of validators called a committee to attest to the data in the shards. There are 1,024 total shards"
4451,2019-03-21 22:50:20+00:00,ljxie,3/ Phase 0 involves the ‚Äúbeacon chain‚Äù which is the main chain and will eventually coordinate the shards (think hub-and-spoke model). It will use proof of stake and a new asset ‚Äúbeacon ETH‚Äù (BETH). You deposit ETH to get BETH (one-way) and stake 32 BETH to become a validator
